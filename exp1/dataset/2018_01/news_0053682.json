The BOJ’s policy guidance is to control the 10-year yield “around zero percent.”\nThe move was a bit of surprise to market players, who had expected the BOJ to stick to the status quo in its market operations.\nThe BOJ maintained the purchase amount of three other maturity zones it offered to buy on Wednesday - one to three-years, 10 to 25 years and 25 to 40 years.\nThe 10-year JGB futures price extended gains to 150.27 , up 0.10 point for the day. The yield on the benchmark 10-year cash JGBs fell 0.5 basis point to 0.085 percent .\nThe five-year yield dipped 0.5 basis point to minus 0.080 percent.\n$1 = 108.93 yen Reporting by Hideyuki Sano, Editing by Sherry Jacob-Phillips\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-01-31T10:08:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-31T04:31:31.006+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
