This leaves the “middle ground” of the industry at risk, he added. \nIn a separate interview with CNBC, Rod Sides, vice chairman of Deloitte’s U.S. Retail & Distribution practice, likened the retail industry to a bow tie. The two far ends of the spectrum — luxury, on one side, and off-price retailers and dollar stores, on the other — are seeing new highs, leaving everyone else in a “knot” in the middle. \nOppenheimer analyst Brian Nagel said during an economic roundtable that it will “take consumers time to get used to having [more] money in their pockets.” \nIn other words, the transition won’t happen overnight. He expects a slight impact, or more consumer spending, to trickle out into the first half of 2018, but the biggest impacts might not hit retailers until 2019, when shoppers become more comfortable in opening up their wallets even wider. \n“Retailers are getting excited, but their plans are still not clear,” Nagel said. \nNeiman Marcus’ outgoing CEO, Karen Katz, told CNBC luxury brands had a strong holiday season and have a better outlook for 2018. Names like Kering , which owns Gucci and Yves Saint Laurent, and LVMH , the parent company of Louis Vuitton and Hennessy, could reap some of the biggest benefits from a tax windfall. \nKicking off the year on a high note, after three consecutive years of posting same-store sales declines for the holiday period, luxury jewelry brand Tiffany on Wednesday said its total comparable sales jumped 3 percent this past November and December. \n“The consumer is strong and products are trending well here. … These results indicate a favorable consumer spending backdrop which should continue into calendar 2018,” Jefferies analyst Randal Konik said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-17T22:39:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-17T22:50:49.024+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
