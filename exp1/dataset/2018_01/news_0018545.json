The U.S. Department of Homeland Security on Monday said the protected status would end in September 2019.\nThe Canadian government is “prepared” for a possible influx of border-crossing asylum seekers, but does not expect one, said Hursh Jaswal, spokesman for Immigration and Refugee Minister Ahmed Hussen.\nThe ministry is sending Member of Parliament Pablo Rodriguez to California next week to talk to government officials and immigration groups about how Canada’s immigration and refugee system works, Jaswal said.\nRodriguez is at least the third official whom Canada has sent to the United States in recent months to dispel misinformation about winning asylum. Most recently, the immigration minister himself went to Minneapolis, which is home to the largest Somali population in the United States.\nMore than 18,000 asylum seekers illegally crossed the U.S. border into Canada last year to file refugee claims, almost 17,000 of whom went to the primarily French-speaking province of Quebec.\nAsylum seekers cross illegally because under a U.S.-Canada agreement they will be turned back if they try to file refugee claims at formal land border crossings, because asylum seekers must file claims in the first country where they land, unless they meet certain exemptions.\nRefugee status requires a claimant to convince decision-makers of a well-founded fear of persecution in his or her country of origin.\nAngela Ventura, a representative of a Salvadoran-Canadian association in Windsor, Ontario, said she expects Salvadorans in the United States to move north following Monday’s announcement.\nMany of them have reasonable grounds for claiming refugee status in Canada, said Toronto refugee lawyer Raoul Boulakia. “The situation in El Salvador is extremely dangerous,” he said.\nCanada treats some claims for asylum differently than does the United States.\nMore than 500 Salvadorans claimed refugee status in Canada in the first nine months of last year - more than double the total for 2016 and more than any year since at least 2013, according to Immigration and Refugee Board statistics. About two-thirds of the claimants whose cases were finalized were granted refugee status.\nReporting by Anna Mehler Paperny; Editing by Leslie Adler\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-10T22:51:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-10T23:08:21.007+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
