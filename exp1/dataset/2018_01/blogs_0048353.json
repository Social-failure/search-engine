Spain’s Foreign Ministry said it was offering consular assistance to a group of Spanish nationals in Senegal. \nIt was the second violent incident in Casamance this year, raising concerns that worsening security there might damage one of Senegal’s main tourist attractions. \nThe Spanish group was traveling in a hired vehicle with a Senegalese driver. An armed band stopped and hijacked their car, then seized over 4,000 euros ($4,971.20) in cash and raped two women on the roadside before fleeing, according to the colonel, speaking on condition of anonymity. \nHe said the Senegalese army was searching for the attackers. \nEarlier this month, unidentified gunmen in Casamance attacked a group of civilians searching for firewood, killing 14 and wounding several others. The motives for the shooting remain unknown, and the army has since been deployed into the area to investigate.
