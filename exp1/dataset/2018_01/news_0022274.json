He has short periods of arrhythmia,” his lead doctor, Alejandro Aguinaga, told El Comercio.\nPresident Pedro Pablo Kuczynski cited Fujimori’s health in pardoning him for convictions on human rights violations and graft charges less than halfway through a 25-year prison sentence. Kuczynski’s decision, which was widely seen as a political maneuver to avoid being ousted by Congress, triggered cabinet resignations and large protests.\nReporting by Marco Aquino; Editing by Nick Zieminski; Writing by Luc Cohen\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-15T00:36:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-15T00:54:34.016+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
