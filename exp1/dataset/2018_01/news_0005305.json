The restaurant's dollar menu already contains more than 20 items ranging from breakfast tacos to cinnamon twists.\nAlready two fast food giants have followed suit with Jack in the Box's \"Value Done Jack's Way,\" a a value menu with items priced between $1 and $5 and McDonald's relaunching its previously discontinued Dollar Menu with a new three-tiered value menu that includes items ranging from $1 to $3.\nCustomers can order Taco Bell's new seasoned fries with a side of nacho cheese from the dollar menu or opt to make the order \"Supreme\" — adding pico de gallo, beef and sour cream on top — for $2.49 or \"Bell Grande\" — all the same toppings as the \"Supreme,\" just larger — for $3.49.\nIn addition, Taco Bell will be including this new menu item in its $5 box, which comes with the fries, a Doritos Locos taco, a Cheesy Gordita Crunch and a medium drink.\nAs consumers enjoy more and more dining options, restaurants remain focused on value, convenience and quality to stay competitive. For Taco Bell, limited-time offers and value promotions have been a steady part of the playbook.\nTaco Bell told CNBC that its $1 menu items garnered more than $500 million in sales in 2017 and its $5 boxes, which often contain its limited-time offerings, generated an additional $1 billion in sales for the brand.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-03T18:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-03T17:59:32.009+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
