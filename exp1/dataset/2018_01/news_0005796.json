The Company will resubmit its Phase 3 protocol for FSGS during the first quarter of 2018.\nFeasibility analyses and regulatory interaction for sparsentan in IgA nephropathy are underway with the expectation of initiating a clinical trial in 2018.\nCNSA-001 is expected to begin clinical development for phenylketonuria (PKU) in 2018 with results from a Phase 2 proof-of-concept study expected to be available in early 2019.\nThe Company expects a New Drug Application filing in 2018 for its new formulation of Thiola ® for the treatment of cystinuria, and anticipates marketing efforts to commence upon potential approval in 2019.\nIn late February, the Company expects to announce final financial results from the fourth quarter and full-year 2017, as well as provide a detailed corporate update.\nAbout Retrophin\nRetrophin is a biopharmaceutical company specializing in identifying, developing and delivering life-changing therapies to people living with rare diseases. The Company’s approach centers on its pipeline featuring late-stage assets targeting rare diseases with significant unmet medical needs, including fosmetpantotenate for pantothenate kinase-associated neurodegeneration (PKAN), a life-threatening neurological disorder that typically begins in early childhood, and sparsentan for focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS) and IgA nephropathy (IgAN), disorders characterized by progressive scarring of the kidney often leading to end-stage renal disease and glomerulonephritis, respectively. Research in additional rare diseases is also underway, including a joint development arrangement evaluating the potential of CNSA-001 in phenylketonuria (PKU), a rare genetic metabolic condition that can lead to neurological and behavioral impairment. Retrophin’s R&D efforts are supported by revenues from the Company’s commercial products Chenodal ® , Cholbam ® and Thiola ® .\nRetrophin.com\nThis press release contains \" \" as that term is defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.
