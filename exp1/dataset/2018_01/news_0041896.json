But it could also threaten U.S. plans to stabilize and rebuild a large area of northeast Syria.\nManbij, to the east of Afrin, is part of a much larger area of northern Syria controlled by the U.S.-backed Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), led by the YPG.\nReporting by Orhan Coskun and Ercan Gurses; Writing by Daren Butler; Editing by David Dolan\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-01-24T19:44:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-25T13:01:21.013+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
