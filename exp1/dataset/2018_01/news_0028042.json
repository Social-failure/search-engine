I think having to make the move took a lot out of him.”\nWhile anti-doping officials investigate the allegations, U.S. Anti-Doping Agency said that Gatlin was eligible to compete.\nJohnson, before he took the job, said he also was assured by USADA and USA Track & Field that Gatlin was under no sanction or suspected sanction.\nTheir previous parting was amicable because Gatlin works best with talented training partners, which Johnson did not have at the time, the coach said.\nJustin Gatlin from the U.S. reacts after the men's 100m final during the 15th IAAF World Championships at the National Stadium in Beijing, China August 23, 2015.

Do you think... that his body has taken less of a beating than Justin‘s?”\nReporting by Gene Cherry in Salvo, North Carolina, editing by Pritha Sarkar\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-19T19:15:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-19T20:13:11.039+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
