It grants a week to consider more ambiguous cases.\nThe Network Enforcement Act, colloquially referred to as the \"Facebook law,\" also includes defamatory posts and incitements of violence.\nAll three companies have previously said they'll cooperate with the new restrictions.\nTwitter declined to comment Tuesday on how the company would operate under the new law. Google did not immediately return request for comment.\n\"We're committed to removing hate speech any time we become aware of it,\" Facebook said in a June statement on the company's blog.\nGiven the history of the Nazi era, Germany is especially sensitive to hate crimes.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-02T17:04:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-02T17:05:18.022+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
