Shares of the jet-engine maker have underperformed the market over the past 12 months, up 16 percent versus the S&P 500's 19 percent climb. \nThe analyst raised his price target on the company to $160 from $124, representing 25 percent upside from Tuesday's close. McConnell noted that while investments in company segments such as Pratt and Otis have hampered performance recently, the company's patience is about to pay off. \nSeparately, RBC downgraded shares of United Technologies competitor Honeywell on Wednesday. \nUnited Technologies made headlines in September after agreeing to buy aircraft parts manufacturer Rockwell Collins for $30 billion. Under the deal, the companies said the Rockwell Collins and United Technologies's aerospace systems segments will be combined to create a new business unit named Collins Aerospace Systems.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-03T15:40:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-03T15:58:30.001+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
