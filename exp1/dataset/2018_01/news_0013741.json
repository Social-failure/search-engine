If some of them lead to significant strikes that would have a positive impact on prices,” Hernandez said. \nGiven the potential for supply issues, Cochilco predicted a global copper supply deficit of 175,000 tonnes in 2018, versus 67,000 in 2017. \nCochilco expects Chile to produce 5.74 million tonnes this year, up 4.9 percent from the 2017, when a strike at BHP’s Escondida copper mine, the world’s largest, sharply reduced output. \nProduction would rise slightly to 5.91 million tonnes in 2019, the agency said in a statement. \nChile’s largest producer of copper is state-miner Codelco, the world’s top copper producer.
