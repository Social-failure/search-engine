We will work with the C-NLOPB and take the actions necessary to satisfy the regulator,” Husky CEO Rob Peabody said in a statement.\nHusky spokesman Mel Duvall said the company does not know for how long the SeaRose FPSO will be shut down.\nReporting by Nia Williams; Editing by Sandra Maler\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-18T00:21:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-18T00:36:40.008+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
