Mr Boudjellal could face disciplinary action.” \nBastareaud made the comments during a 36-0 Champions Cup victory against Benetton Treviso on Sunday before apologising on social media. \nBoudjellal, however, told French rugby website rugbyrama.fr: “At no point did Mathieu Bastareaud make a judgement on the sexual orientation of the player in question. I am not homophobic but I have already called someone a faggot. It’s become customary, it’s the first thing that comes to mind in an altercation.” (Reporting by Julien Pretot; Editing by Christian Radnedge)", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-16T20:14:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-16T20:47:10.013+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
