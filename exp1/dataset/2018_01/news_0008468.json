Presumed to be a total loss, the satellite didn’t separate as planned from the upper part of the rocket, these officials said. \nSpace Exploration Technologies Corp., as the company is formally known, in its latest statement appeared to pin the blame elsewhere by saying a data review indicated the rocket “did everything correctly” and management has concluded “no design, operational or other changes are needed.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-09T23:25:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-09T23:30:00.014+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
