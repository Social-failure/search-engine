The so-called \"text bomb\" typically causes an iPhone to crash and, in some cases, restart. \nSending a message which contains the link to Masri's code would be all it takes to activate the bug — even if the recipient did not click on the link. Meanwhile, on a Mac computer, the security flaw was found to crash the Safari browser, as well as causing other slowdowns. \nMasri said he \"always\" reported bugs to the tech-giant before releasing them. Apple said a fix is coming in a software update next week. Tweet 1 \nShortly after the tweet was shared on social media, Masri removed the link from GitHub. \n\"I'm not going to re-upload it … I made my point. Apple needs to take such bugs more seriously,\" he said on Twitter. show chapters 3:40 PM ET Fri, 5 Jan 2018 | 02:57 'More of a nuisance' than a security threat \nRenowned security expert Graham Cluley said the newly discovered bug did not represent a major security threat. Instead, he said the \"text bomb\" was merely an annoyance to Apple consumers. \n\"Something about the so-called ChaiOS bug's code gives your Apple device a brainstorm,\" he said in a blog post published late Tuesday. \n\"Nasty. But, thankfully, more of a nuisance than something that will lead to data being stolen from your computer or a malicious hacker being able to access your files,\" he added. \nLate last year, Apple was scrambling to fix another glitch . The tech behemoth apologized to consumers in November after users of its latest Mac operating system were able to gain entry to the computer without the use of a password.
