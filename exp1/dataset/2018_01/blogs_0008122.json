Reuters reported in December that Didi plans to enter Mexico this year. \nCheng Wei, founder and CEO of Didi, said in Wednesday's statement that \"globalization is a top strategic priority for Didi.\" \nDidi first invested $100 million in 99 in January 2017, getting a stake and management rights in the Brazilian app. \nOne source with knowledge of the matter said the funds selling their stakes in 99 started looking for a buyer several months ago, in mid-2017. \nRiverwood, Monashees, Tiger Global, and Soft Bank Group did not reply to requests for comment. \nDidi has made no secret of its desire to expand beyond China, particularly in light of the growing number of Chinese customers who travel overseas. \nIn December, Didi raised $4 billion from investors, in part to fund global expansion, following on from a $5.5 billion fundraising in April.
