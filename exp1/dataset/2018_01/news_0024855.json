Though police at the time blamed the IRA, the militant organisation denied involvement and no one was convicted. \nAlan Black, the only survivor, told the BBC the video was “depraved” and designed to hurt relatives of the victims. \nMcElduff, who was elected to the British parliament in the West Tyrone constituency but never took up his seat as Sinn Fein does not recognise Britain’s jurisdiction over Northern Ireland, later deleted the tweet. \nSinn Fein, which wants to enter government in both Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland, has struggled to distance itself from the violent legacy of the Provisional Irish Republican Army (IRA), its ex-military wing. \nBut the party was widely criticised for not asking McElduff to step down sooner. Last week it suspended him for the party for three months on full pay, a move the Democratic Unionist Party said demonstrated a lack of respect and compassion for the victims. \nMcElduff “should have resigned in the immediate aftermath of posting the disgraceful video mocking and insulting the horrific terrorist events at Kingsmill,” DUP leader Arlene Foster said in a statement welcoming his resignation. \nThe Provisional IRA waged an insurgency against British rule in Northern Ireland until 1998 in which more than 3,600 people were killed. \nMcElduff in a statement offered a “profound apology” to the victims of the attack, but said he had not intended to give offence since he did not at the time make the connection between the anniversary and the brand of the bread.
