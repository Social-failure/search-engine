The mall attracts three million people of various backgrounds each month, she said.\n“One of the considerations we take in when we work on decoration concepts for Pavilion KL is to create something highly experiential... and also to be socially accepting (for) all,” she said.\nTwelve animals, including a dog and a pig, another animal Muslims consider as unclean, make up the traditional Chinese zodiac.\nMalaysian Muslim leaders have been vocal about events that involve dogs before. After the 2014 Commonwealth Games opening ceremony in Glasgow, when athletes paraded with a Scottish terrier donning their country’s name, local politicians aired their disproval, calling the stunt “disrespectful”.\nIn 2016, religious authorities asked popular pretzel chain Auntie Anne’s to change the name of its “Pretzel Dog” to “Pretzel Sausage”.\nAt MyTOWN, another Kuala Lumpur shopping center where half the visitors are Muslim, the mall downplayed the depiction of dogs in its decorations.\n“We have the dogs but it’s in how we (display) them. They are not the main object. They are life size and placed as ambient decorations,” said Head of Marketing Christopher Koh, so that the canine would not appear like an idol.\n“It’s the same with the pig (for the Year of the Boar), Malaysian retailers won’t usually put up a giant pig as a centerpiece.”\nAlex Chow, who runs a company supplying packaging materials, said corporate clients have stuck to generic illustrations for their packaging designs this year.\nChinese Malaysian Wong Wei-Shen, who has several dogs as pets, said businesses were being “ridiculous”.\n“It’s a shame because Malaysia is a multicultural country. To dismiss the fact that the Chinese have a dog as one of the zodiac animals is unfair,” said Wong.\n“Every zodiac animal has its good attributes, and the dog represents a guide, a best friend, a comforter and loyal friend.” said Wong.\nReporting by Liz Lee; Editing by Praveen Menon and Neil Fullick\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-22T13:45:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-22T14:13:34.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
