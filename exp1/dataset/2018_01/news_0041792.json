Last November, the government announced measures which were also aimed at helping the economy.\n“The third (factor) I would say is that the global economy has recovered much more strongly ...than we expected at the time,” Scholar said.\nBritain’s economy has withstood the Brexit vote shock better than most private economists expected, but it has lagged behind growth rates achieved in other advanced economies.\nSpeaking to the Treasury Committee in the lower house of parliament, Scholar also said the forecasts were based on three potential scenarios for Britain’s future relationship outside the EU, but not the one that British Prime Minister Theresa May wants: a tailor-made trade deal with the bloc.\n“I don’t think the pre-referendum analysis is useful in the current debate about our attempts to secure a deep and special partnership because that’s a different thing to any of the three scenarios that were illustrated in that paper,” he said.\nReporting by William Schomberg; editing by John Stonestreet\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-01-25T01:55:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-24T21:20:47.011+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
