It appears Mnuchin’s comments were more verbal intervention than Draghi‘s.”\nThe euro also rose 0.3 percent against sterling. The pound hit a fresh 19-month high at $1.4346 as the dollar sold off amid the euro rally.\nIn bond markets, German government bond yields rose to their highest levels in over half a year as European Central Bank chief Mario Draghi said euro zone inflation should rise in the medium term.\nReporting by London Markets Team; Writing by Tommy Wilkes\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-01-25T22:15:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-25T23:15:08.014+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
