He hid himself in a crevasse to seek protection from wind. Tomasz in the past has spent a couple of nights above 7,000 metres, but with all the needed equipment ... Now he has no tent,” Majer said. \nMackiewicz has made six previous attempts to scale Nanga Parbat in winter. The first successful winter ascent of the mountain was made as recently as February 2016. \nA GoFundMe web page set up to raise the estimated 50,000 euros (£43,871) required to pay for the rescue operation costs reached its target in four hours. \nPakistan rivals Nepal for the number of peaks over 7,000 meters (23,000 feet). \nIqbal Hussain, the head of the tourism department for Pakistan’s Gilgit region, where Nanga Parbat is located, told Reuters that the rescue operation would begin on Saturday. \nThe Polish foreign ministry said on Twitter that it would assist with the rescue operation, and “on the ground efforts are being coordinated by the Polish Embassy in Islamabad”. \nIn June a Spanish man and an Argentinian perished in an avalanche while trying to scale Nanga Parbat.
