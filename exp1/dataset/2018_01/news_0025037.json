But there’s still a long way to go to the finish and we have to get to Cordoba with no drama, which is never a given,” said Peugeot Sport head Bruno Famin.

They were able to compare that to the tracking and ascertain that Carlos’s point of view was the correct one - of which we never had any doubt.” \nIn the motorcycle category, Spanish challenger Joan Barreda had to withdraw after requesting medical assistance near Fiambala. \nAustralian Toby Price, the 2016 champion, won the stage with Austrian Matthias Walkner on a KTM taking it carefully and staying 32 minutes clear of Argentina’s Honda rider Kevin Benavides. \nThursday’s 12th stage is from Fiambala to San Juan with a 375km timed leg and 348km of liaison. The rally ends in Cordoba on Saturday.
