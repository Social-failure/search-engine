[L4N1P65G4]\nThe minister said that since the United States is near full employment the overhaul’s impact on economic activity would be “limited”. It could, however, make it overheat, he added.\n“That would force the Federal Reserve to act more quickly than it’s been doing up until now,” he said.\nEditing by Dave Graham\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-01-12T09:28:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-12T04:45:56.007+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
