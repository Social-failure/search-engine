In past years maybe I would have lost that match.”\nMcDonald, who had never played anyone higher than world number 69, exited to a warm ovation, having rocked his opponent with aggression and out-thought him with strategy.\nRublev may be buoyed by the young American’s gallantry but also by the wavering of Dimitrov, who has labored for years with a reputation greater than his achievement.\nExpectations he could challenge for the title this year seemed to weigh heavy on his broad shoulders, particularly in the fourth set when his game fell apart.\nTennis - Australian Open - Rod Laver Arena, Melbourne, Australia, January 17, 2018.

REUTERS/Issei Kato Though clad in loud pink from head to toe, Dimitrov retreated into his shell, and hammered a 13th unforced error for the set while McDonald feasted on a string of weak second serves to march into the fifth set with all the momentum.\nDimitrov grafted hard to hold serve, halting a six-game losing streak, but his game remained little more than hit-and-hope.\nHe would have given his serving arm for McDonald to fade, but the American dragged the match deep with superb composure, keeping up the firepower to the last.\nHowever, serving to stay in the match at 7-6, McDonald finally blinked, his only double-fault of the set committed at the worst possible moment.\nHe was never going to die wondering, and he moved in to wind up for a raking forehand that pounded into the net rather than save the match point.\n“There are a lot of emotions going on,” McDonald said.\n”On one hand I‘m pretty excited how I competed tonight... on the other hand I know how close I was to winning, too. That kind of sucks, but he’s good player, he’s been out for a while.\n“Overall, I’d say there’s so many more positives than negatives.”\nEditing by Christian Radnedge\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-01-17T21:08:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-18T16:21:19.005+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
