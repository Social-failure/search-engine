It felt more of an impact in 2017 due to higher inflation - caused by a fall in the value of the pound - and uncertainty among businesses about what Brexit means for them.\nTourism, however, has been a bright spot.\nThursday’s data suggested currency moves were a big factor behind trips to Britain.\nThe number of visitors from North America fell 5.4 percent year-on-year in the third quarter, weighed by the U.S. dollar weakening almost 8 percent against the British pound during the first nine months of 2017, after sterling’s slump in 2016.\nBy contrast, visits from the European Union were up 3.5 percent, likely boosted by the euro strengthening by almost 4 percent against the pound between January and September 2017.\nSpending by foreign visitors in Britain rose by 7.7 percent in the third quarter, the smallest annual increase since the end of 2016.\nSpending from North American and European visitors decreased. But travellers from the Middle East, China, Israel and South Africa ramped up their purchases.\nThe ONS said there was high spending recorded by visitors from Saudi Arabia in particular, although it cautioned that sample sizes for this were relatively small.
