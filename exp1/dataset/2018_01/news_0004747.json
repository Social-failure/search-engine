He is set to take over from Janet Yellen by the time of the next rate-setting meeting on Jan. 31-Feb. 1.\nAt its December meeting, the Fed kept its forecast for three rate rises this year and in 2019 unchanged even as policymakers anticipated a short-term boost in U.S. economic growth from the Trump administration's sweeping $1.5 trillion tax overhaul signed into law on Dec. 22.\nThe tax changes reduce the corporate rate from 35 percent to 21 percent and temporarily cuts the taxes paid by most individuals as well.\nIn the minutes, many policymakers \"expected the proposed cuts in personal taxes to provide some boost to consumer spending\" and many characterized the changes in business taxes as likely to provide a modest boost to capital spending.\n\"However, some business contacts...noted that the increase in cash flow that would result...was more likely to be used for mergers and acquisitions or for debt reduction and stock buybacks,\" the minutes said.\nIn December, the Fed forecast ultra-low unemployment of below 4 percent in 2018 and 2019, but still predicted inflation would remain below 2 percent at the end of 2018.\nThe mystery of low inflation in such a robust economy has prompted debate at the Fed for the past several months and was the concern of the two policymakers who voted against a rate increase at last month's meeting.\nThe latest minutes showed that while participants generally viewed inflation rising back to target over the medium term, several said \"other persistent factors may be holding down inflation.\"\nInvestors have all but ruled out an interest rate increase at the Fed's upcoming meeting but currently see another nudge upwards at the following one in March.
