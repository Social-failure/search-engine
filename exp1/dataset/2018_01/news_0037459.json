The union has demanded 12 percent.\nA source at the company, which employs 5,000 people, said Cerrejon was willing to continue talks over the next few days in the hopes of avoiding a stoppage.\nIf the union members decide for a strike, it could begin within 10 days of the Jan. 29 close of voting.\nProduction and exports at Cerrejon fell for the third straight year in 2017, when it mined 31.7 million tonnes of coal, as heavy rainfall affected operations, the owners said this month.\nThe last strike at Cerrejon, which produces coal at its open pit mine in northern La Guajira province, was in February 2013 and lasted 32 days.
