Including this tax item, net income for Lakeland Financial Corporation was a record $57.3 million for 2017, versus $52.1 million for 2016. Diluted net income per common share increased to $2.23 for 2017, versus $2.05 for 2016. This per share performance also represents a record for the company and its shareholders.\nDavid M. Findlay, President and CEO commented, “We are pleased that 2017 marks our eighth consecutive year of record income performance. We are particularly proud of our performance over a long period of time as we have reported record net income in 28 of the last 29 years. Our performance-based culture is the result of Lake City Bank’s unwavering focus on serving customers in our Indiana footprint each and every day with financial services solutions that help our Indiana communities prosper.”\nExcluding the effect of the non-cash, non-operating and non-recurring income tax provision, net income for the three months ended December 31, 2017 was $15.8 million representing an increase of 17% over the fourth quarter of 2016. Diluted net income per common share, excluding the effect of the tax item was $0.61 for the three months and year ended December 31, 2017, representing an increase of 15% over the fourth quarter in 2016. 1\nIncluding the non-cash, non-operating and non-recurring tax adjustment, the company reported quarterly net income of $11.6 million for the fourth quarter of 2017, versus $13.5 million for the fourth quarter of 2016. Diluted net income per common share was $0.45 for the fourth quarter of 2017 versus $0.53 for the comparable period of 2016. Net income was $15.8 million and $0.62 per diluted common share for the third quarter 2017.\nAs a result of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act that was enacted into law on December 22, 2017, the company revalued its net deferred tax asset position to reflect the reduction in its federal corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21%. This revaluation resulted in a non-cash, non-operating and non-recurring income tax expense adjustment of approximately $4.1 million, or $0.16 per diluted share, for the fourth quarter of 2017. The company’s revaluation of its net deferred asset and other relevant details remain subject to modifications as the company finalizes its financial results for the year ended December 31, 2017 and as information and analysis regarding the Act and other relevant factors emerge.\nHighlights for the quarter are noted below:\n4th Quarter 2017 versus 4th Quarter 2016 highlights:\nOrganic average loan growth of $354 million or 10% Average deposit growth of $361 million or 10% Net interest income increase of $4.5 million or 15% Net interest margin increase of 15 basis points to 3.33% Revenue growth of $5.2 million or 13% Continued strong asset quality with nonperforming assets to total assets at 0.20% compared to 0.16% Net charge-offs of $226,000 versus $285,000 a year ago Tangible common equity 1 increase of $40.9 million or 10%\n4th Quarter 2017 versus 3rd Quarter 2017 highlights:\nOrganic average loan growth of $110 million or 3% Average deposit growth of $273 million or 7% Net interest income increase of $772,000 or 2% Revenue growth of $737,000 or 2% Continued strong asset quality with nonperforming assets to total assets at 0.20% compared to 0.24% Net charge-offs of $226,000 versus net recoveries of $484,000 in the prior quarter Tangible common equity 1 increase of $5.5 million or 1%\nFindlay added, “Our double digit loan and deposit growth in 2017 was the foundation of our continued growth in profitability. We experienced loan growth in every region of the bank and it was well-distributed in both new and mature markets. Similarly, each of our regions grew deposits in 2017.”\nAs previously announced on January 9, 2018, the board of directors approved a cash dividend for the fourth quarter of $0.22 per share, payable on February 5, 2018, to shareholders of record as of January 25, 2018. The fourth quarter dividend per share represents a 16% increase over the dividend rate paid in the last three quarters of 2016 and in the first quarter of 2017 of $0.19 per share.\nReturn on average total equity for the year ended December 31, 2017 was 12.72% compared to 12.52% in 2016. Return on average assets for 2017 and 2016 was 1.29%. The company’s total capital as a percent of risk-weighted assets was 13.26% at December 31, 2017, compared to 13.23% at December 31, 2016 and 13.58% at September 30, 2017. The company’s tangible common equity 1 to tangible assets ratio was 9.93% at December 31, 2017, compared to 9.89% at December 31, 2016 and 10.32% at September 30, 2017.\nAverage total loans for 2017 was $3.61 billion, an increase of $385.3 million, or 12%, versus $3.23 billion for 2016. Total loans outstanding grew $347.5 million, or 10%, from $3.47 billion as of December 31, 2016 to $3.82 billion as of December 31, 2017. On a linked quarter basis, total loans grew $183.2 million, or 5%, from $3.64 billion at September 30, 2017. Average total loans for the fourth quarter of 2017 was $3.73 billion, an increase of $354.2 million, or 10% versus $3.37 billion for the comparable period of 2016. On a linked quarter basis, average total loans increased by $110.3 million, or 3%, from $3.62 billion for the third quarter of 2017 to $3.73 billion for the fourth quarter of 2017.\nAverage total deposits for 2017 was $3.76 billion, an increase of $279.4 million, or 8%, versus $3.48 billion for 2016. Total deposits grew $430.7 million, or 12%, from $3.58 billion as of December 31, 2016 to $4.01 billion as of December 31, 2017. In addition, total core deposits, which exclude brokered deposits, increased $259.9 million, or 7%, from $3.48 billion at December 31, 2016 to $3.74 billion at December 31, 2017. This increase in core deposits was driven by growth of retail deposits, commercial deposits and public fund deposits, which increased by $118.1 million to $1.507 billion, $85.1 million to $969 million and $56.7 million to $1.264 billion, respectively, on a year over year basis.\nThe company’s net interest margin increased 15 basis points to 3.33% for 2017 compared to 3.18% for 2016. The company’s net interest margin was also 3.33% in the fourth quarter of 2017 versus 3.18% for the fourth quarter of 2016. The higher margin in the fourth quarter of 2017 was due to higher yields on both loans and securities, partially offset by a higher cost of funds. On a linked quarter basis, the net interest margin decreased two basis points from 3.35% in the third quarter of 2017 due to increased deposit costs which exceeded the increase in earning asset yields. Net interest income increased $17.4 million, or 15%, to $135.9 million in 2017 versus $118.5 million in 2016. Net interest income increased $4.5 million, or 15%, to $35.4 million for the fourth quarter of 2017, versus $30.9 million in the fourth quarter of 2016.\nFindlay observed, “The three Federal Reserve Bank fed fund increases in 2017 positively impacted our asset sensitive balance sheet and resulted in net interest margin expansion of 15 basis points during the year. The positive impact of the rate increases enabled us to be more aggressive with deposit pricing, which clearly benefits our clients with higher earnings on their deposits with Lake City Bank.”\nThe company recorded a provision for loan losses of $3.0 million in 2017, versus $1.2 million in 2016, primarily resulting from growth in the loan portfolio. On a linked quarter basis, provision for loan losses increased by $1.4 million from $450,000 in the third quarter 2017 to $1.9 million in the fourth quarter 2017. The company’s allowance for loan losses as of December 31, 2017 was $47.1 million compared to $43.7 million as of December 31, 2016 and $45.5 million as of September 30, 2017. The allowance for loan losses represented 1.23% of total loans as of December 31, 2017 versus 1.26% at December 31, 2016 and 1.25% as of September 30, 2017.\nNonperforming assets increased $2.6 million, or 39%, to $9.5 million as of December 31, 2017 versus $6.9 million as of December 31, 2016 due to an increase in nonaccrual loans. On a linked quarter basis, nonperforming assets were $1.0 million lower than the $10.5 million reported as of September 30, 2017 due to a reduction in nonaccrual loans resulting primarily from loan pay downs. The ratio of nonperforming assets to total assets at December 31, 2017 increased to 0.20% from 0.16% at December 31, 2016 and decreased from 0.24% at September 30, 2017. Net recoveries to average loans were 0.01% in 2017 compared to net charge-offs of 0.03% in 2016 and represent net recoveries of $403,000 in 2017 versus net charge-offs of $1.0 million in 2016.\nFindlay noted, “We were pleased to report net recoveries for 2017. We believe that this reflects the general operating strength of our client base, as well as the overall healthy economic conditions in our Indiana markets. Our increased provision expense for the year is the direct result of our strong loan growth.”\nThe company’s noninterest income increased $3.1 million, or 10%, to $36.0 million in 2017, compared to $32.9 million in 2016. The company’s noninterest income increased $726,000 or 8%, to $9.5 million for the fourth quarter of 2017 versus $8.7 million for the fourth quarter of 2016. During 2017, noninterest income was positively impacted by increases in recurring fee income for service charges on deposit accounts, primarily due to growth in fees from business accounts, and wealth advisory fees. Offsetting these increases were decreases in other income driven by lower mortgage banking income due to lower mortgage originations. Increases in noninterest income in the fourth quarter of 2017 compared to the fourth quarter of 2016 resulted from service charges on deposit accounts as well as higher wealth advisory fees, offset by lower mortgage banking income.\nThe company’s noninterest expense increased $6.3 million, or 9%, to $79.3 million in 2017, compared to $73.0 million in 2016. The company’s noninterest expense increased by $1.2 million, or 7% to $19.6 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 compared to $18.4 million in the fourth quarter of 2016. Salaries and employee benefits increased primarily due to incentive-based compensation costs, normal merit increases and staff additions related to the company’s continued growth and expansion. Corporate and business development expense increased primarily due to higher community support and donation expense as well as higher advertising expenses. Equipment costs increased driven by the company’s branch expansion, continued investment in technology based equipment and remodeling of existing branches and other offices. The company's efficiency ratio was 46.1% for 2017 compared to 48.2% for 2016. The company’s efficiency ratio was 43.7% for the fourth quarter of 2017, compared to 46.4% for the fourth quarter of 2016 and 45.9% for the linked third quarter of 2017.\nFindlay added, “During 2017, we continued to expand our presence in Indianapolis with the opening of a new office in Greenwood. In addition, we continue to prioritize investments in technology to enhance consumer banking solutions as well as to protect customer information.”\nLakeland Financial Corporation is a $4.7 billion bank holding company headquartered in Warsaw, Indiana.

exempt income was converted to a fully taxable equivalent basis at a 35 percent tax rate for 2017 and 2016. The tax equivalent rate for tax exempt loans and tax exempt securities acquired after January 1, 1983 included the Tax Equity and Fiscal Responsibility Act of 1982 (“TEFRA”) adjustment applicable to nondeductible interest expenses. Taxable equivalent basis adjustments were $839,000, $813,000 and $619,000 in the three-month periods ended December 31, 2017, September 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016, respectively. (2 ) Loan fees, which are immaterial in relation to total taxable loan interest income for 2017 and 2016, are included as taxable loan interest income. (3 ) Nonaccrual loans are included in the average balance of taxable loans. (1) Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures\nTangible common equity, tangible assets, tangible book value per share and the tangible common equity to tangible assets ratio are non-GAAP financial measures calculated using GAAP amounts. Tangible common equity is calculated by excluding the balance of goodwill and other intangible assets from the calculation of stockholders’ equity, net of deferred tax. Tangible assets are calculated by excluding the balance of goodwill and other intangible assets from the calculation of total assets, net of deferred tax. Tangible book value per share is calculated by dividing tangible common equity by the number of shares outstanding. Because not all companies use the same calculation of tangible common equity and tangible assets, this presentation may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures calculated by other companies. However, management considers these measures of the company’s value including only earning assets as meaningful to an understanding of the company’s financial information.\nNet income applicable to Lakeland Financial Corporation and earnings per diluted share, excluding the income tax expense adjustment for the deferred tax asset revaluation, are non-GAAP financial measures that the company considers useful for investors to allow better comparability of operating performance. The income tax expense adjustment consists of a $4.1 million, or $0.16 per diluted common share, revaluation of the company’s net deferred tax asset as a result of the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act in 2017.\nA reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures is provided below (dollars in thousands, except per share data).\nThree Months Ended Twelve Months Ended Dec. 31, Sep. 30, Dec. 31, Dec. 31, Dec. 31, 2017\n2017\n2016\n2017\n2016\nTotal Equity $ 468,667 $ 462,516 $ 427,067 $ 468,667 $ 427,067 Less: Goodwill (4,970 ) (4,970 ) (4,970 ) (4,970 ) (4,970 ) Plus: Deferred tax assets related to goodwill 1,171 1,860 1,836 1,171 1,836 Tangible Common Equity 464,868 459,406 423,933 464,868 423,933 Assets $ 4,682,976 $ 4,454,236 $ 4,290,025 $ 4,682,976 $ 4,290,025 Less: Goodwill (4,970 ) (4,970 ) (4,970 ) (4,970 ) (4,970 ) Plus: Deferred tax assets related to goodwill 1,171 1,860 1,836 1,171 1,836 Tangible Assets 4,679,177 4,451,126 4,286,891 4,679,177 4,286,891 Ending common shares issued 25,194,903 25,194,903 25,096,087 25,194,903 25,096,087 Tangible Book Value Per Common Share $ 18.45 $ 18.23 $ 16.89 $ 18.45 $ 16.89 Tangible Common Equity/Tangible Assets 9.93 % 10.32 % 9.89 % 9.93 % 9.89 % Net Income $ 11,627 $ 15,825 $ 13,522 $ 57,330 $ 52,084 Plus: Additional tax expense due to adjusting deferred tax asset 4,137 0 0 4,137 0 Net income excluding effect of deferred tax adjustment $ 15,764 $ 15,825 $ 13,522 $ 61,467 $ 52,084 Diluted Weighted Average Common Shares Outstanding 25,701,337 25,656,403 25,518,069 25,663,381 25,460,727 Diluted net income per share excluding effect of of deferred tax adjustment $ 0.61 $ 0.62 $ 0.53 $ 2.40 $ 2.05\nContact\nLisa M.
