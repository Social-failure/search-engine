That included some that had been received at end-2016. \nThe efforts generated 104 million francs in additional tax revenue. \nMeanwhile, the canton of Lucerne said it had generated 15.5 million francs in additional taxes from new self-disclosures last year, seeing an uptick in the number of cases but a decline in the sums each taxpayer declared. \nFigures for other cantons were not immediately available.
