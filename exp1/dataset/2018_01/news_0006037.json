Average hourly earnings rose 0.3 percent, compared to 0.1 percent in November.\n“The market is shrugging it off because it’s not weak enough to detract the Fed from raising rates further.

The market doesn’t care. The margin of error on this number is always big,” said Paul Nolte, portfolio manager at Kingsview Asset Management in Chicago, referring to the U.S. jobs data.\n“What we’d be concerned about is if we see a couple of prints below 100,000. Until then, we’re okay,” he added.\nThe dollar index last .DXY rose 0.1 percent, with the euro EUR= down 0.18 percent to $1.2045.\nThe Japanese yen weakened 0.35 percent at 113.17 per dollar, while Sterling GBP= was last trading at $1.3569, up 0.13 percent on the day.\nU.S. Treasury yields rose on optimism over new tax cuts and the rise in monthly wage gains in the jobs report.\nBenchmark 10-year notes US10YT=RR last fell 7/32 in price to yield 2.4781 percent, from 2.453 percent late on Thursday.\nThe 30-year bond US30YT=RR last fell 20/32 in price to yield 2.816 percent, from 2.786 percent late on Thursday.\nOil prices fell with U.S. production soaring.
