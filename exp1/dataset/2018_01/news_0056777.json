[\nU.N. data shows the majority of the hungry - 489 million people - live in countries where there is war.\nThe report highlighted 16 countries globally, plus West Africa’s Lake Chad basin, that face the greatest hunger risks.\nSyria and Lebanon - which is hosting millions of Syrian refugees - were the third worst hit, with 33 percent of the population short of food.\n“The intensification of conflicts is a key reason behind the recent resurgence of world hunger levels,” the Food and Agriculture Organization said.\n“Activities to support resilient livelihoods must be combined with peacebuilding and conflict resolution.”\nTwo countries – Afghanistan and the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) - have seen dramatic increases in the number of people needing food aid over the last year, the report said.\nIn Afghanistan, 7.6 million people need help, with many in areas that are difficult for aid agencies to access and where armed groups are present, it said.\nThe situation in the DRC is also “deteriorating”, with 7.7 million people short of food, an increase of almost 2 million since 2016, it said.\n“Many people are eating little more than a meal a day – typically just maize or cassava root and leaves,” it said.\nThe DRC was identified as 2017’s most neglected crisis, according to a Thomson Reuters Foundation survey.\nReporting By Thin Lei Win, Editing by Katy Migiro.
