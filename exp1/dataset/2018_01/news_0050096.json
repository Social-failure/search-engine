The date has been postponed several times since the military took power in a 2014 coup.\nThe protest on Saturday was a reaction to a decision by Thai lawmakers this week to change an election law, which meant the vote would be pushed back possibly until January or February next year.\nCritics and analysts have said the move could be a ploy by the ruling junta to hold on to power.\nA pro-democracy protester wearing the face mask with a written message, takes part in a protest against junta delaying polls in Bangkok, Thailand January 27, 2018. REUTERS/Athit Perawongmetha “We are gathering here today to demand that the election take place this year, in November, like General Prayuth Chan-ocha has promised,” prominent activist Rangsiman Rome told a crowd of protesters chanting that they wanted to go to the polls.\nRangsiman and Sirawith Seritiwat, another activist leader, also threatened that there will be protests next month.\n“On February 10, unless the junta says elections will take place in November this year, we will meet at Democracy Monument,” Sirawith said.\nThe gathering ended after almost two hours without violence.\nReporting by Patpicha Tanakasempipat; Editing by Mark Potter\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-27T14:38:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-27T15:17:02.012+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
