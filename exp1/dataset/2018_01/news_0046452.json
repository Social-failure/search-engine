(\"the Company\") (OTC Pink: AVBH), a bank holding company and the parent company of Avidbank (\"the Bank\"), an independent full-service commercial bank serving businesses and consumers in Northern California, announced unaudited consolidated net income of $1,009,000 for the fourth quarter of 2017 compared to $1,122,000 for the same period in 2016. Results for the fourth quarter of 2017 included a $1.1 million charge to income tax expense as a result of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017.\nFull Year and Fourth Quarter 2017 Financial Highlights\nNet income was $5,654,000 in 2017 compared to $7,263,000 in 2016. Net income in 2016 excluding benefits from life insurance proceeds of $1,472,000 was $5,791,000. Net income in 2017 excluding the $1.1 million impact from the tax law change was $6,755,000. Net income in 2017 included a loan loss provision of $1,985,000 while a loan loss provision of $813,000 was recognized in 2016. Net interest income was $30,528,000 in 2017, an increase of $6,267,000 or 26% over the figure recorded in 2016. Diluted earnings per common share (EPS) were $1.08 in 2017, compared to $1.56 in 2016. Diluted EPS for 2017 without the $1.1 million tax law change would have been $1.29. Weighted average common shares outstanding were 5,138,604 and 4,521,392 in 2017 and 2016, respectively. The increase was primarily the result of a $20,000,000 capital raise completed during the third quarter of 2017. Net interest income was $8,182,000 for the fourth quarter of 2017, an increase of $1,742,000 over the $6,440,000 we achieved in the fourth quarter of 2016. The 27% increase over the prior year quarter reflects the impact of our loan growth over the past twelve months. Net income was $1,009,000 for the fourth quarter of 2017, compared to $1,122,000 for the fourth quarter of 2016. Net income in the fourth quarter of 2017 excluding the $1.1 million impact from the tax law change would have been $2,110,000. Results for the fourth quarter of 2017 included a $106,000 loan loss provision compared to a loan loss provision of $813,000 in the fourth quarter of 2016. Diluted earnings per common share were $0.17 for the fourth quarter of 2017, compared to $0.24 for the fourth quarter of 2016. Diluted EPS for the fourth quarter of 2017 without the $1.1 million tax law change would have been $0.36. Total assets grew by 21% in 2017, ending the fourth quarter at $783 million. Total loans net of deferred fees grew by 26% in 2017, ending the fourth quarter at $648 million. Total deposits grew by 14% in 2017, ending the fourth quarter at $646 million. The Company continues to be well capitalized for regulatory purposes with a Tier 1 Leverage Ratio of 11.4%, a Tier 1 Risk Based Capital and Common Equity Tier 1 Risk Based Capital Ratio of 10.7%, and a Total Risk Based Capital Ratio of 13.1%.\nMark D. Mordell, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, stated, \"Net interest income increased to $8.2 million in the fourth quarter of 2017, a 27% increase over the fourth quarter of 2016 due to our loan growth over the past twelve months. Loans grew a record $70 million in the fourth quarter as we achieved solid growth in all our divisions: specialty finance, commercial real estate, commercial and construction lending. We are committed to a growth strategy to achieve optimal profitability and have made substantial investments in personnel and facilities to help realize that goal responsibly. Our $20 million capital raise completed in July 2017 has provided us with the capacity required to grow the loan portfolio. We are well positioned to continue the franchise growth strategy to scale our balance sheet and infrastructure to serve our markets.‚Äù\nMr. Mordell continued, \"In 2017 we added both business development and support staff to sustain and manage our growth. We have also expanded and relocated our facilities to accommodate our growth in staff as well as increase staff retention due to more favorable commute times. Non-interest expenses increased by $0.7 million to $5.2 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 from $4.5 million in the fourth quarter of 2016, primarily due to these increased investments. Our efficiency ratio improved to 60.4% in the fourth quarter of 2017 from 64.5% in the fourth quarter 2016 due to increased earnings from our loan growth. Total deposits decreased by $13 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 compared to the third quarter of 2017 and increased by $78 million from the same quarter in 2016. The decline in deposits for the fourth quarter of 2017 was primarily due to a decrease in demand deposits and brokered deposits. Our net interest margin grew to 4.32% in 2017 compared to 4.06% in 2016 due to changes in the mix of earning assets in favor of higher yielding loans. Return on assets was 0.77% in 2017 compared to 1.14% in 2016. Return on assets excluding the impact of the tax law change was 0.91% in 2017.\"\nResults for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017\nNet interest income before provision for loan losses was $30.5 million in 2017, an increase of $6.3 million or 26% over the prior year. Higher outstanding average loan balances were the primary reason for the increase. Average total loans were $573 million for 2017 compared to $439 million for 2016. Average earning assets were $706 million in 2017, an 18% increase over the prior year. Net interest margin was 4.32% in 2017 compared to 4.06% for 2016. The increase in net interest margin was primarily caused by an increase in higher yielding loans in the mix of earning assets. A loan loss provision of $1,985,000 was recorded in 2017 and a loan loss provision of $813,000 was taken in 2016. We had no charge-offs and recoveries of $68,000 in 2017 compared to no charge-offs and recoveries of $37,000 for 2016.\nNon-interest income was $1,887,000 in 2017, a decrease of $1,333,000 or 41% compared to 2016. When the $1,472,000 in life insurance proceeds recognized in the second quarter of 2016 is excluded, non-interest income was $139,000 higher in 2017 as a result of increased service charges.\nNon-interest expense increased by $3.8 million to $19.6 million in 2017 compared to $15.8 million in 2016 due primarily to increased investments in loan production and support personnel and expanded facilities to accommodate the growth in staff.\nThe effective tax rate was 47.8% in 2017 compared to 33.2% for the same period in 2016. The unusually high effective tax rate in 2017 was due to the income tax expense charge from the passage of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act at the end of the year. The lower effective tax rate in 2016 was due to non-taxable proceeds from life insurance benefits.\nResults for the quarter ended December 31, 2017\nFor the three months ended December 31, 2017, net interest income before provision for loan losses was $8.2 million, an increase of $1.7 million or 27% compared to the fourth quarter of 2016. The increase was primarily the result of higher average loans outstanding. Average total loans outstanding for the quarter ended December 31, 2017 were $599 million, compared to $477 million for the same quarter in 2016, an increase of 26%. Average earning assets were $750 million in the fourth quarter of 2017, a 21% increase over the fourth quarter of the prior year. Loans made up 80% of average earning assets at the end of the fourth quarter of 2017 compared to 77% at the end of the fourth quarter of 2016. Net interest margin was 4.33% for the fourth quarter of 2017, compared to 4.14% for the fourth quarter of 2016. A loan loss provision of $106,000 was taken in the fourth quarter of 2017 compared with a loan loss provision of $813,000 taken in the fourth quarter of 2016.\nNon-interest income was $475,000 in the fourth quarter of 2017, a decrease of $65,000 or 12% compared to the fourth quarter of 2016. The decrease was primarily due to $151,000 of income from an FHLB special dividend in the fourth quarter of 2016.\nNon-interest expense increased by $727,000 in the fourth quarter of 2017 to $5,232,000 compared to $4,505,000 for the fourth quarter of 2016. This increase was primarily due to higher compensation costs related to increased staffing and increased occupancy costs due to the expansion of our facilities. The Bank's full time equivalent employees at December 31, 2017 and 2016 were 84 and 68, respectively. The Bank's efficiency ratio improved from 64.5% in the fourth quarter of 2016 to 60.4% in the fourth quarter of 2017 due to growth in net interest income.\nBalance Sheet\nTotal assets increased to $783.0 million as of December 31, 2017, compared to $763.8 million at September 30, 2017 and $646.7 million on the same day one year ago. The increase in total assets of $19.2 million, or 3%, from September 30, 2017 was primarily due to FHLB borrowings in the fourth quarter of 2017. The Company reported total loans at December 31, 2017 of $648.3 million, which represented an increase of $69.8 million, or 12%, from $578.5 million at September 30, 2017, and an increase of $133.5 million, or 26%, over $514.8 million at December 31, 2016. The increase in total loans from September 30, 2017 was primarily attributable to growth in commercial real estate, multi-family, specialty finance and construction loans. The increase in loans from December 31, 2016 was primarily attributable to growth in commercial real estate, construction and commercial loans.\n\"We had $5.2 million in non-accrual loans comprising 0.79% of total loans from one relationship on December 31, 2017 compared to no non-accrual loans at the end of the prior year,‚Äù observed Mr. Mordell.\nThe Company‚Äôs total deposits were $646.4 million as of December 31, 2017, which represented a decrease of $13.3 million, or 2%, compared to $659.7 million at September 30, 2017 and an increase of $78.4 million, or 14%, compared to $568.0 million at December 31, 2016. The decrease in deposits from September 30, 2017 was due to a decrease in demand deposits and brokered deposits. The increase from December 31, 2016 was caused by an increase in demand deposits, CDs greater than $100,000 and money market accounts. The Company had $30 million of Federal Home Loan Bank advances outstanding as of December 31, 2017.\nDemand and interest bearing transaction deposits represented 45% of total deposits at December 31, 2017, compared to 47% at September 30, 2017 and 46% for the same period one year ago. Core deposits, which include transaction deposits, money market accounts and CDs below $250,000, represented 87% of total deposits at December 31, 2017, compared to 87% at September 30, 2017 and 86% at December 31, 2016. The Company‚Äôs loan to deposit ratio was 100% at December 31, 2017 compared to 88% at September 30, 2017 and 91% at December 31, 2016.\nAbout Avidbank\nAvidbank Holdings, Inc.
