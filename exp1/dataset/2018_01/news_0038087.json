Denmark top the group with six points from four games, followed by Spain with four points from three.\nThe top two teams from each group will advance to Friday’s semi-finals, with the final scheduled for Sunday.\nHandball - Men's EHF European Handball Championship - main round Group I - Serbia v France - Arena Zagreb, Zagreb, Croatia - January 22, 2018. Milan Jovanovic of Serbia in action with Dika Mem of France. Shambolic Serbian defending allowed France to stroll to another emphatic win without hitting top gear in the tournament’s highest-scoring contest, as their defensive specialist Luka Karabatic rifled in seven goals.\nKarabatic thrived on the playmaking skills of his more illustrious brother Nikola, who dished out assists like confetti against Serbia who had earlier lost any chance of reaching the medal rounds.\nSlideshow (2 Images) Raphael Caucheteux also netted seven times for world champions France, who seem to have plenty left in the tank for the business end of the tournament.\nSweden used their trademark fast breaks to devastating effect against Belarus, having carved out a 9:4 lead in the opening 15 minutes.\nBelarus reduced the deficit to 16:14 early in the second half before Sweden pulled away again with a 7-1 streak and ran out easy winners.\nWriting by Zoran Milosavljevic in Belgrade; Editing by Pritha Sarkar\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-23T00:42:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-23T00:53:18.011+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
