The stake is valued at about 632 million euros ($786 million) at current prices.\nHNA has also said it was planning to list airport ground services operator Swissport, which sources say could raise at least 2.7 billion Swiss francs ($3 billion).\nZhao Quan, head of HNA’s tourism division and a board director, told Reuters last month the group would sell 1180 6th Avenue in New York, while reviewing its portfolio of other overseas assets.\nZhao said the company was not selling its holdings “blindly”, while characterizing the Hilton and Deutsche Bank stakes as “successful” financial investments.\nHNA borrowing, including bank loans and bonds, surged by more than a third over the first 11 months of last year to 637.5 billion yuan, according to a China bond market filing by HNA.\nHNA’s assets amounted to 1.2 trillion yuan at the end of June, according to a separate bond market filing.\n($1 = 6.2900 Chinese yuan renminbi)\n($1 = 0.9319 Swiss francs)\n($1 = 0.8037 euros)\nReporting by Beijing Monitoring Desk and Matthew Miller; Editing by Himani Sarkar\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-31T12:39:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-31T12:54:24.003+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
