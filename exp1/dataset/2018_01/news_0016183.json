The reason given by the regulator for the move was that the charter of the committee had expired, one of the people said.\nThe SEC did not immediately return a request for comment.\nThe demise of the stock market-centric advisory group comes on the eve of the first meeting of the SEC’s new Fixed Income Market Structure Advisory Committee. The new group’s inaugural meeting on Thursday will feature a discussion around liquidity in the bond market.\nThe SEC’s disbanding of the Equity Market Structure Advisory Committee was first reported by Bloomberg News.\nReporting by John McCrank and Trevor Hunnicutt; Editing by Leslie Adler\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-01-11T09:32:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-11T03:44:07.034+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
