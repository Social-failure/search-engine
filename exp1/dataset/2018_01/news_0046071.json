(the “Company”) (NASDAQ: HONE), the holding company for HarborOne Bank (the “Bank”), announced net income of $1.6 million, or $0.05 per basic and diluted share, for the fourth quarter of 2017, compared to $2.8 million, or $0.09 per basic and diluted share, for the prior quarter and net income of $2.9 million, or $0.09 per basic and diluted share, for the same quarter last year. The decrease in net income in the fourth quarter of 2017 primarily reflects a decrease in mortgage banking income of $1.5 million due to a decrease in mortgage origination volumes. One-time items impacting fourth quarter net income include a $1.2 million reversal of a contingent consideration accrual for Merrimack Mortgage Company, LLC that was settled in the fourth quarter and is included in other income, an accrual of $925,000 to freeze the director’s post retirement benefit plan included in other expenses and a charge of $243,000 related to the revaluation of the Company’s net deferred tax assets as a result of the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 included in the income tax provision.\nThe Company reported net income for the full year of $10.4 million, or $0.33 per basic and diluted share, as compared to net income of $5.9 million for the prior year. The Company’s year-to-date results for 2016 included a one-time contribution of $4.8 million to The HarborOne Foundation; excluding this non-recurring expense, net income for 2016 would have been $8.8 million.\nJames W. Blake, President and CEO stated, “During the quarter we generated steady growth in our commercial loan portfolio and plan to maintain our growth strategy in 2018 with a new branch and the continued expansion of our lending portfolio. We look forward to the coming year as we strive to continue building a banking franchise dedicated to providing superior customer service, robust product offerings and committed support to our communities.”\nNet Interest Income\nThe Company’s net interest and dividend income was $19.4 million for the quarter ended December 31, 2017, up $163,000, or 0.8%, from $19.3 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2017 and up $2.9 million, or 17.4%, from $16.6 million for the quarter ended December 31, 2016. The tax-equivalent interest rate spread and net interest margin were 2.90% and 3.07%, respectively, for the quarter ended December 31, 2017 compared to 2.91% and 3.07%, respectively, for the quarter ended September 30, 2017 and 2.77% and 2.92%, respectively, for the quarter ended December 31, 2016.\nThe increase in net interest income from the previous quarter reflects a $395,000, or 1.7%, increase in total interest and dividend income and an increase of $232,000, or 5.6% in total interest expense. The increase in interest and dividend income is primarily due commercial loan growth that provided an increase in average outstanding loans of $64.8 million that was partially offset by decreases in the average balances of residential real estate and consumer loans. The yield on loans was 3.94% for the quarter ended December 31, 2017 and 3.95% for the quarter ended September 30, 2017. The third quarter yield reflects the impact of a $680,000 commercial loan prepayment penalty. The increase in interest expense is due to an increase in average interest-bearing deposits of $14.8 million with a 7 basis point increase in the cost of those funds offset by a decrease in average FHLB advances of $7.8 million and a 10 basis point decrease in total cost of borrowed funds.\nThe increase in net interest income over the prior year quarter is primarily due to growth in the Company’s average loan balances to $2.23 billion from $2.06 billion and an increase in the yield on loans to 3.94% from 3.65%, again primarily driven by commercial loan growth as well as higher rates on variable rate loans. Total interest and dividend income increased $2.7 million, or 13.3%, and total interest expense increased $883,000, or 25.3% over the prior year quarter as a result of rising interest rates.\nNoninterest Income\nNoninterest income decreased to $14.2 million for the quarter ended December 31, 2017, down $473,000, or 3.2%, from the quarter ended September 30, 2017. The decrease is primarily due to a decrease in mortgage banking income of $1.5 million as mortgage originations decreased 12.4% from the prior quarter. Changes in the mortgage servicing rights fair value adjustments amounted to a $74,000 decrease in the fourth quarter of 2017 compared to a $488,000 decrease in the third quarter of 2017. An increase of $1.0 million in other income partially offset the mortgage banking income decrease. Other income includes a $1.2 million reversal of contingent consideration for the Merrimack Mortgage Company, LLC earn out agreement that was settled in full in the fourth quarter of 2017.\nNoninterest income decreased $5.1 million, or 26.6%, as compared to the quarter ended December 31, 2016, primarily driven by a decrease of $6.3 million, or 41.1%, in mortgage banking income. Compared to the same quarter prior year, mortgage originations by Merrimack Mortgage Company, LLC decreased 28.7% in 2017 primarily as a result of higher residential mortgage interest rates and reduced refinance volume in 2017.\nNoninterest Expense\nNoninterest expenses were $29.7 million for the quarter ended December 31, 2017, an increase of $1.3 million, or 4.4%, from the quarter ended September 30, 2017. The increase was primarily due to an increase in other expenses of $1.2 million, or 56.2%. The increase primarily reflects an expense accrual of $925,000 to freeze the director postretirement benefit plan.\nNoninterest expenses increased $330,000, or 1.1%, from the quarter ended December 31, 2016. Increases in occupancy and equipment of $529,000, marketing of $101,000, professional fees of $275,000, deposit insurance of $204,000 and other expenses of $1.0 million were partially offset by decreases in compensation and benefit expense of $866,000 and loan expense of $958,000. Decreased mortgage originations in the fourth quarter of 2017 primarily contributed to the expense decreases in that quarter as compared to the fourth quarter of 2016. The increase in occupancy and equipment expense is primarily due to an increase in service maintenance contract costs and the increase in other expenses is due to the aforementioned accrual to freeze the director postretirement benefits.\nIncome Tax Provision\nThe effective tax rate was 49.2% for the quarter ended December 31, 2017, 37.5% for the quarter ended September 30, 2017 and 41.5% for the quarter ended December 31, 2016. The enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 resulted in significant changes to the U.S. tax code, including a reduction in the top corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21% effective January 1, 2018. As a result of the reduction in tax rate, the Company revalued its net deferred tax asset and recorded a one-time additional $243,000 tax provision in the fourth quarter of 2017. In addition, as a result of the recently enacted reduction in the corporate income tax rate the Company expects an effective tax rate for 2018 of approximately 26%.\nAsset Quality\nThe Company recorded a provision for loan losses of $760,000 for the quarter ended December 31, 2017, $921,000 for the quarter ended September 30, 2017 and $1.5 million for the quarter ended December 31, 2016. The provisions for the fourth quarter of 2017 and 2016 were primarily due to commercial loan growth. The third quarter 2017 provision was a result of commercial loan growth and an additional specific reserve of $375,000 on a substandard commercial loan. In the first quarter of 2017, the Company adjusted general reserve allocations for commercial real estate and commercial loans based on updated peer data. The updated peer data resulted in lower general reserve rates on these loan types; however, this decrease was partially offset by commercial loan growth. Changes in the provision for loan losses are based on management’s assessment of loan portfolio growth and composition changes, historical charge-off trends, and ongoing evaluation of credit quality and current economic conditions. The allowance for loan losses was $18.5 million, or 0.84%, of total loans at December 31, 2017, compared to $17.9 million, or 0.84%, of total loans, at September 30, 2017 and $17.0 million, or 0.85%, of total loans at December 31, 2016. Net charge-offs totaled $204,000 for the quarter ended December 31, 2017, or 0.04%, of average loans outstanding on an annualized basis, compared to $169,000, or 0.03%, for the quarter ended September 30, 2017 and $320,000, or 0.06%, for the quarter ended December 31, 2016.\nNonperforming assets were $18.6 million at December 31, 2017 compared to $20.6 million at September 30, 2017 and $22.9 million at December 31, 2016. Nonperforming assets as a percentage of total assets were 0.69% at December 31, 2017, 0.78% at September 30, 2017 and 0.94% at December 31, 2016. The steady decline reflects the Company’s continued efforts to minimize nonperforming assets through diligent collection efforts, prudent workout arrangements and strong underwriting.\nBalance Sheet\nTotal assets increased $25.5 million, or 1.0%, to $2.68 billion at December 31, 2017 from $2.66 billion at September 30, 2017. Net loans increased $71.9 million, or 3.4%, to $2.18 billion at December 31, 2017 from $2.10 billion at September 30, 2017. The net increase in loans for the three months ended December 31, 2017 was primarily due to increases of $32.4 million in commercial real estate loans and $52.0 million in construction loans partially offset by a decrease of $2.5 million in residential real estate loans, $2.1 million in commercial and industrial loans, and $5.9 million in consumer loans. Loans held for sale decreased $36.7 million, or 38.2%, to $59.5 million at December 31, 2017 from $96.2 million at September 30, 2017 due to the seasonal decrease in residential mortgage originations.\nTotal deposits increased $10.2 million, or 0.5%, to $2.01 billion at December 31, 2017 from $2.00 billion at September 30, 2017. Compared to the prior quarter, non-certificate accounts increased $5.7 million, brokered deposits increased $363,000 and term certificate accounts increased $4.2 million. The increase in non-certificate accounts was primarily due to an increase in money market accounts. Borrowings were $290.4 million at December 31, 2017 and $276.4 million at September 30, 2017.\nTotal stockholders’ equity was $343.5 million at December 31, 2017 compared to $340.6 million at September 30, 2017 and $329.4 million at December 31, 2016. The tangible common equity to tangible assets ratio was 12.35% at December 31, 2017, 12.36% at September 30, 2017 and 12.97% at December 31, 2016. At December 31, 2017, the Company and the Bank exceed all regulatory capital requirements.\nAnnual Meeting\nHarborOne Bancorp, Inc. has scheduled its annual meeting of shareholders for Thursday, May 10, 2018 at 5:00 p.m. local time, at Goodwin Procter LLP, 100 Northern Avenue, Boston, MA 02210.
