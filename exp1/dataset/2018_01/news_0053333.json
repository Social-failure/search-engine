The margin of error was 2.8 percent. \nReuters reported last week that Kuczynski negotiated Fujimori’s release with the ex-leader’s son, Kenji, in exchange for political support in Congress, citing sources. \nThe poll found 50 percent of Peruvians supported the pardon, while 49 percent were opposed. That reflected deep divisions over the legacy of Fujimori. \nSome credit him with stabilizing the economy and defeating leftist rebels during his 10-year rule starting in 1990, but others see him as a corrupt dictator. \nBoth Kuczynski’s and Kenji’s representatives have denied that the pardon was politically motivated.
