(Click reut.rs/2Dc5U9E for a picture package of Bhutan's changing face.) \nInside a gaudily lit dance club, guests watch a 38-year-old woman swaying to the songs they choose, usually traditional folk music but sometimes a Bollywood number or two. \nLhaden, a divorced mother-of-two, dances until midnight, and like thousands of her compatriots, is struggling to make ends meet. \n“I‘m not happy or sad about things, I have no other choice,” said Lhaden, who only has one name. \nBhutan measures its national wealth by a Gross National Happiness index aiming to build a contented, fulfilled society. But Lhaden, who earns $125 a month, is counting the pennies.
