It had flagged 2017 as its “toughest year yet”.\nLamprell sees its net cash position trending downwards in 2018, hurt by its investment in the Saudi Maritime Yard and payment for inventory and the cash impact of remaining losses on the EA1 Project.\nThe company said it expects the market to remain challenging in 2018 because of low activity in the oil industry.\nReporting by Hanna Paul in Bengaluru; Editing by Susan Fenton and David Goodman\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-01-25T00:40:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-25T12:55:16.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
