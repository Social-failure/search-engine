These secondary stock sales will be completed by the end of the day Thursday on the Nasdaq Private Market, an Uber spokesman said. \nThe investor group, which is co-led by SoftBank and Dragoneer Investment Group, has also completed a $1.25-billion investment of fresh cash at the other, higher valuation, the spokesman said. \nIn all, the investors will take a 17.5-percent stake in Uber, with SoftBank keeping 15 percent, becoming the company’s largest shareholder. The investment triggers a number of governance changes at Uber, including the addition of new board members, which take effect immediately. \n“This is a great outcome for our shareholders, employees and customers, strengthening Uber’s governance as we double down on our technology investments and continue to bring our services to more people in more places around the world,” said the Uber spokesman.

He had offered to sell half of his shares.
