We are certainly preparing for all scenarios, and we're hopeful that we can make progress,\" a spokesman for Foreign Minister Chrystia Freeland said when asked about the latest visits.\n\"That's what we're focused on achieving, including in Montreal,\" Alex Lawrence, the spokesman, said in an e-mailed statement.\nSeparate news releases announcing the ministerial trips make clear the cabinet members have been instructed to \"promote trade and NAFTA.\"\nPublic Safety Minister Ralph Goodale wraps up a two-day trip to Kentucky on Friday while Agriculture Minister Lawrence MacAulay is due to visit Tennessee over the weekend. At the same time, Environment Minister Catherine McKenna will be in San Francisco.\nCanadian officials are increasingly pessimistic about the prospects for the 1994 trade treaty, which U.S. President Donald Trump blames for the loss of hundreds of thousands of U.S. manufacturing jobs and a big trade deficit with Mexico.\nIn a low-level meeting held in Washington last month between the fifth and sixth rounds, negotiators made some progress on less controversial issues but left untouched the thorniest subjects of the sourcing of auto parts, dispute settlement and an expiry clause.\nTrade experts predict that unless Canada and Mexico make some concessions in Montreal, Trump will be more tempted to issue a notice of withdrawal from NAFTA, as he has repeatedly threatened if U.S. demands for change cannot be met.
