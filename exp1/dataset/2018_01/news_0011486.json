It said legal certainty would be boosted by the additional time period.\n“Citizens and businesses would have an additional three months after exit day to start court cases where they believe the general principles of EU law have not been followed prior to exit day,” the statement said.\nIf approved by lawmakers, the change would be added to Brexit legislation currently passing through parliament.\nThe change was one of several technical adjustments proposed by the government ahead of a debate in parliament next week on the European Union (Withdrawal) Bill.\nThe bill is central to Prime Minister Theresa May’s exit plans, repealing the laws which make Britain a member of the bloc and copying EU law into British law to give businesses legal certainty about the complex process of leaving.\nReporting by William James.
