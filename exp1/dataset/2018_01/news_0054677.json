Defense lawyers also said Chin had no reason the believe that the steroids were contaminated before they were shipped. \nThe verdict in Chin’s case came after a separate jury in March found Cadden guilty of racketeering and fraud but similarly cleared him of second-degree murder over the deaths of 25 people.
