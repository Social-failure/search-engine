We are pleased that the ITC have now recognized this.”\nThe U.S. International Trade Commission voted 4-0 to reject Boeing’s claims that it suffered injury by Bombardier underpricing the CSeries in the U.S. market and discarded a Commerce Department recommendation to slap a near 300-percent duty on sales of the 110-to-130-seat jets for five years.\nReporting by Shalini Nagarajan in Bengaluru and Kate Holton in London; Editing by Alison Williams\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-01-27T05:20:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-27T00:06:30.005+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
