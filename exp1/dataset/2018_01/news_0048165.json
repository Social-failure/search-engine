(“CapStar”) (NASDAQ:CSTR) reported unaudited net income of $91,000, or $0.01 per share on a fully diluted basis, for the three months ended December 31, 2017. As a result of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 that was signed into law last month, CapStar revalued its net deferred tax asset position. CapStar currently expects that the revaluation will result in a one-time, non-cash charge of approximately $3.6 million, or $0.27 per share on a fully diluted basis. Reconciliations of non-GAAP measures are provided in the tables that follow. Adjusted net income was $3.7 million, or $0.28 per share on a fully diluted basis for the three months ended December 31, 2017, compared to net income of $2.9 million, or $0.23 per share on a fully diluted basis, for the three months ended December 31, 2016.\n“We remain focused on delivering consistent financial results for our shareholders through sound, profitable growth,” said Claire W. Tucker, CapStar’s president and chief executive officer. “The recent addition of a SBA team is intended to augment financial results by expanding market penetration and enhancing fee income.”\nSoundness\nThe allowance for loan losses represented 1.45% of total loans at December 31, 2017 compared to 1.24% at December 31, 2016.\nNon-performing assets as a percentage of total loans and other real estate owned was 0.28% at December 31, 2017 compared to 0.39% at December 31, 2016.\nAnnualized net charge-offs (recoveries) to average loans was 0.15% for the three months ended December 31, 2017 compared to (0.02%) for the same period in 2016.\nThe total risk based capital ratio was 12.50% at December 31, 2017 compared to 12.60% at December 31, 2016.\nProfitability\nReturn on average assets (\"ROAA\") for the three months ended December 31, 2017 was 0.03% compared to 0.88% for the same period in 2016.\n• Adjusting for the impact for tax reform, our adjusted ROAA was 1.09%.\nThe net interest margin (“NIM”) for the three months ended December 31, 2017 was 3.26% compared to 3.17% for the same period in 2016.\nThe efficiency ratio for the three months ended December 31, 2017 was 65.6% compared to 65.8% for the same period in 2016.\nGrowth\nAverage demand deposits for the quarter ended December 31, 2017 increased 29.5%, to $253.6 million, compared to $195.9 million for the same period in 2016.\nAverage gross loans for the quarter ended December 31, 2017 increased 1.9%, to $956.4 million, compared to $938.9 million for the same period in 2016.\nAverage total assets for the quarter ended December 31, 2017 increased 0.4%, to $1.33 billion, compared to $1.32 billion for the same period in 2016.\n“Although 2017 presented some challenges, there are many positives that have us excited about our prospects for 2018,” said Rob Anderson, chief financial officer and chief administrative officer of CapStar. “Banking is a relationship business, and our bankers continue to have success growing core relationships, as over half of our deposit book is now in DDA or NOW checking accounts. In addition, our treasury management and other deposit service charges increased 38% over prior year.”\nConference Call and Webcast Information\nCapStar will host a conference call and webcast at 8:30 a.m. Central Time on Friday, January 26, 2018.

These statements are often, but not always, made through the use of words or phrases such as “may,” “should,” “could,” “predict,” “potential,” “believe,” “will likely result,” “expect,” “continue,” “will,” “anticipate,” “seek,” “aspire,” “achieve,” “estimate,” “intend,” “plan,” “project,” “projection,” “forecast,” “roadmap,” “goal,” “guidance”, “target,” “would,” and “outlook,” or the negative version of those words or other comparable words of a future or forward-looking nature. These forward-looking statements are not historical facts, and are based on current expectations, estimates and projections about CapStar’s industry, management’s beliefs and certain assumptions made by management, many of which, by their nature, are inherently uncertain and beyond CapStar’s control. The inclusion of these forward-looking statements should not be regarded as a representation by CapStar or any other person that such expectations, estimates and projections will be achieved. Accordingly, CapStar cautions you that any such forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and are subject to risks, assumptions and uncertainties that are difficult to predict. Although CapStar believes that the expectations reflected in these forward-looking statements are reasonable as of the date made, actual results may prove to be materially different from the results expressed or implied by the forward-looking statements. There are or will be important factors that could cause CapStar’s actual results to differ materially from those indicated in these forward-looking statements, including, but not limited to, any factors identified in this earnings release as well as those factors that are detailed from time to time in CapStar’s periodic and current reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including those factors included in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2016 under the headings “Item 1A. Risk Factors” and “Cautionary Note Regarding Forward Looking Statements” and in the Company’s Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q and Current Reports on Form 8-K. If one or more events related to these or other risks or uncertainties materialize, or if CapStar’s underlying assumptions prove to be incorrect, actual results may differ materially from our forward-looking statements. Accordingly, you should not place undue reliance on any such forward-looking statements. Any forward-looking statement speaks only as of the date of this earnings release, and CapStar does not undertake any obligation to publicly update or review any forward-looking statement, whether as a result of new information, future developments or otherwise, except as required by law. New risks and uncertainties may emerge from time to time, and it is not possible for CapStar to predict their occurrence or how they will affect CapStar.\nNon-GAAP Disclaimer\nThis earnings release includes the following financial measures that were prepared other than in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (“non-GAAP financial measure”): adjusted net income, adjusted diluted net income per share, adjusted return on average assets, adjusted return on average tangible common equity and tangible book value per share. These non-GAAP financial measures (i) provide useful information to management and investors that is supplementary to CapStar’s financial condition, results of operations and cash flows computed in accordance with GAAP, (ii) enable a more complete understanding of factors and trends affecting CapStar’s business, and (iii) allow investors to evaluate CapStar’s performance in a manner similar to management, the financial services industry, bank stock analysts and bank regulators; however, CapStar acknowledges that these non-GAAP financial measures have a number of limitations. As such, you should not view these non-GAAP financial measures as a substitute for results determined in accordance with GAAP, and they are not necessarily comparable to non-GAAP financial measures that other companies use. See below for a reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure.\nCAPSTAR FINANCIAL HOLDINGS, INC.
