Republicans approved tax cuts in December that will add about $1.5 trillion to the debt over 10 years.\nAfter a dramatic standoff with Democrats over immigration policy, Congress approved the stopgap bill to fund the federal government until Feb. 8. President Donald Trump signed it into law late Monday, ending a three-day government shutdown.\nThe bill delays the implementation of three taxes - a medical device tax, a health insurance tax, and a \"Cadillac\" tax for high-end insurance plans - that were mandated by former President Barack Obama's Affordable Care Act, or Obamacare.\nThe debt run-up will come from the loss of the projected revenues from these taxes, which was immediately denounced by a conservative fiscal watchdog in Washington.\nMaya MacGuineas, president of the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, said in a statement: \"While we are relieved policymakers have reopened the government, we are deeply troubled by the decision to use this must-pass legislation as a vehicle to cut taxes and add to the debt.\"\n\"On the heels of a truly unaffordable tax cut, Congress has now chosen to add another $30 billion in debt-financed tax cuts as the price to keep the governments lights on for a few weeks,\" she said.
