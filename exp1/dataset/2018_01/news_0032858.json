The latter is aimed at putting more pressure on the company’s management to take shareholders’ perspectives into consideration. \nSparx, which owns 6.1 percent of shares in the company according to Thomson Reuters data, said it is planning to consult with shareholder advisers and seek possible collaboration with other institutional investors.
