U.S. President Donald Trump’s administration wants the threshold raised to 85 percent, with half of the content made in the United States, a proposal that is untenable for Canada and Mexico.\nFILE PHOTO: Newly assembled vehicles are seen at a stockyard of the automobile plant Toyota Motor Manufacturing of Baja California in Tijuana, Mexico, April 30, 2017. REUTERS/Jorge Duenes/File Photo Canadian negotiators presented their so-called creative ideas as a counterpoint to the U.S. demands, but offered no numbers of their own, Lighthizer told reporters.\nEduardo Solis, the head of Mexico’s main auto industry group, also reacted coolly to the Canadian proposal, telling reporters he needed to ensure that North America’s auto industry remained competitive.\nFILE PHOTO - Ford and Lincoln vehicles are parked outside the Oakville Assembly Plant in Oakville, Ontario, Canada on November 6, 2016. REUTERS/Chris Helgren/File Photo “There is no counterproposal. We will review this conceptual framework, these ideas before answering,” said Solis, president of the Mexican Automotive Industry Association.\nFlavio Volpe, president ‎of the Toronto-based Automotive Parts Manufacturers’ Association, suggested Lighthizer’s tough rhetoric was a negotiating tactic.\n“A year ago we were talking about a 35 percent import tariff and we were talking about tariffs that were going to be specific to certain companies,” he said. “I think it’s part of rhetorical evolution of this administration in the way they negotiate.”\nCanada and the United States have found common ground on the desire to include labor conditions in the deal.\nWith auto manufacturing soaring in lower-cost Mexico, where the next round of talks is to begin on Feb. 26, Canada and the United States have both called for a new NAFTA deal to include strong, enforceable labor provisions.\nReporting by David Lawder, Allison Lampert, Anthony Esposito and David Ljunggren in Montreal; Editing by Matthew Lewis\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-01-30T08:49:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-30T03:12:49.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
