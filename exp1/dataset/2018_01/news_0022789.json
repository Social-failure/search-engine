It hit a three-year low of 90.341 earlier.\nThe Canadian dollar fell 0.38 percent to C$1.2477.\nThe euro was down 0.16 percent at $1.2239 after hitting a three-year peak versus the greenback at $1.2322, Reuters data showed.\n(Graphic for Euro valuations, click reut.rs/1KbTvEA )\nFILE PHOTO: A U.S. Dollar note is seen in this June 22, 2017 illustration photo. REUTERS/Thomas White/Illustration/File Photo Digital currencies suffered another day of heavy losses on worries about a widening regulatory crackdown.\nBitcoin fell more than 10 percent to below $10,000 for the first time since Dec. 1 on the Luxembourg-based Bitstamp exchange. The biggest digital currency has lost half its value since it peaked near $20,000 about a month ago.\nECB WEIGHS IN ON RISING EURO The speed of the euro’s rise in early 2018 - up more than 3 percent in the last two weeks - has prompted comments from ECB officials, highlighting growing concerns, according to analysts.\nECB policymaker Ewald Nowotny told reporters on Wednesday the euro’s recent strength against the dollar is “not helpful,” which encouraged a bout of profit-taking before a policy meeting next week.\nIn an interview with Italian newspaper la Repubblica Vitor Constancio, the ECB vice president, said he did not rule out that monetary policy would still continue to be “very accommodating for a long time”.\n“The euro’s strength will cause some concerns to the ECB and it will definitely complicate their policymaking thinking, and some investors are taking profits after the recent rally,” said Adam Cole, chief FX strategist at RBC Capital Markets in London.\n(Graphic for World FX rates in 2017, click tmsnrt.rs/2egbfVh )\nAdditional reporting by Saikat Chatterjee in London; Editing by William Maclean and Susan Thomas\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-17T06:55:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-17T07:35:01.006+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
