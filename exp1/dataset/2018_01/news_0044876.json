But certainly there’s enough players available to not make too many changes. \n“I’d rather be in a stronger position in the league to attack the cup. Having said that we take less pressure into this game.” \nPardew celebrated his first win as West Brom manager in the FA Cup third round against Exeter City and followed up with a 2-0 Premier League victory against Brighton and Hove Albion earlier this month.

Slideshow (4 Images) \nBritish media reports have linked Evans with a move to Arsenal in a swap deal, which includes Mathieu Debuchy going the other way. But Pardew dismissed the reports, saying no official bids have been made for the player. \n“That’s not a deal that’s been put to us... we haven’t had a bid put to us that is anywhere near acceptable,” he added. \n“What I will confirm is what you already know, Jonny Evans is a target for other clubs, we might sell if the price is right, that’s that deal, everything else is pure speculation.” Reporting by Hardik Vyas in Bengaluru, editing by Pritha Sarkar", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-26T20:27:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-26T21:15:46.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
