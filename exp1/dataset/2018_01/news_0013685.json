FILE PHOTO - People walk past the London Stock Exchange Group offices in the City of London, Britain, December 29, 2017. REUTERS/Toby Melville \nThe FTSE 100 .FTSE fell 0.12 percent, with Carillion shares suspended from trading after one of the biggest UK corporate failures in years. \nThe weakness in equities came as the pound currency held onto a strong gain marked up on Friday following a media report, later denied, that the Dutch and Spanish governments were open to a deal for Britain to remain as close as possible to the EU after Brexit. \n“It is still unclear how the collapse of (Carillion) will impact the broader UK economy, particularly further down the supply chain,” said Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets. \nBalfour Beatty fell 3.3 percent, Galliford Try dropped 7.3 percent and Carillion supplier Speedy Hire dropped 5.7 percent. Some other industry players rose on the hope they could acquire contracts from Carillion. Kier Group rose 3.5 percent. \nRival outsourcer Serco ( SRP.L ) jumped 7.4 percent as investors speculated it could pick up a chunk of lucrative healthcare facilities management work. \nUBS analysts said Carillion’s collapse might ease competition in the sector, but it may not be a game-changer. \n“We think the impact will likely be small given the fragmented nature of the market”, they said. \nEngineering firm GKN ( GKN.L ), trying to fend off an offer of 405 pence per share from turnaround specialist Melrose ( MRON.L ), led the blue-chip index with a 4.1 percent rise. City AM reported that U.S. buyout house Carlyle was planning a bid of its own. \nMelrose (up 1.4 percent) said it planned to meet GKN shareholders to convince them of the benefits of its 7 billion- pound offer, which GKN management had rejected. \nAcacia Mining ( ACAA.L ) rose 1.5 percent after it reported gold production in the last quarter of 2017 exceeded expectations. \nGold prices on Monday rose to their highest since September, buoyed by a weaker U.S. dollar, which slumped to three-year lows against a basket of currencies. \nBP ( BP.L ) and Royal Dutch Shell ( RDSa.L ) retreated 0.4 percent and 0.3 percent respectively as oil prices held just below December 2014 highs. \nFinancials also weighed on the index, with Standard Chartered losing 2 percent SNAT.L and HSBC ( HSBA.L ) 0.9 percent.
