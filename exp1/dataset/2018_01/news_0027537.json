However, it could also involve a restructuring of the debt or more pressure on banks to make provisions or write off some of the debt.\nShares in Advanced Petrochemical dropped 3.2 percent after the company estimated its 2017 net profit fell to 631.1 million riyals ($168.3 million) from 731.9 million riyals.\nQatar’s index added 0.7 percent as a broad-based rally continued, with Qatar National Bank, the top lender, gaining 1.1 percent ahead of its fourth-quarter earnings announcement on Tuesday.\nDubai rose 0.5 percent as real estate blue chip Emaar Properties surged 2.0 percent. But Abu Dhabi edged down 0.1 percent despite a 2.1 percent gain by Waha Capital in active trade.
