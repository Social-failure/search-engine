Sinn Fein’s Northern Ireland leader Michelle O‘Neill said she understood that the timeframe was just two weeks. \nBradley will update the British parliament on progress on Feb 7. \nLondon already had to step in last year and set a budget for Northern Ireland and many in the province fear direct rule would further destabilise the delicate political balance between pro-British unionists and Irish nationalists. \nThe absence of an executive in the province has also limited its say in Britain’s negotiations to leave the European Union that are set to have a bigger impact on Northern Ireland than on any other part of the United Kingdom. \nPrevious bilateral talks between the DUP and Sinn Fein have failed to meet a number of deadlines to reach agreement. \nDisagreement remains on a range of issues, including same-sex marriage, which remains illegal in Northern Ireland despite being legal in the rest of Britain and Ireland, rights for Irish language speakers and funding for inquests into deaths linked to the conflict.
