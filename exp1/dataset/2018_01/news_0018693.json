Last month, the company’s former chairman and three other construction executives were placed in pretrial detention over bribery allegations that they deny.\n“Grana y Montero reaffirms that the company is opposed to any anti-competitive practice, and welcomes the investigation that is under way,” Grana said in a statement.\nGrana’s shares in Lima had risen by 2.5 percent before falling back to a 2 percent gain after the attorney general office’s announcement.\nReporting By Mitra Taj; Editing by Rosalba O'Brien and Peter Cooney\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-01-13T05:02:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-13T06:54:26.024+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
