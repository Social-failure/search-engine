Pressure from online commerce in part contributed to the cuts and led to a rash of store closures, even among household names. \nBut where retailers like Macy's and Toys R US have struggled, Cast said Walmart has flourished. He predicted an uptick in online sales for the retailer. \n\"I believe Walmart will continue to use the internet and grow their e-commerce sales for about 4 or 5 percent now to well over 10 percent,\" Cast said. \nHis outlook for the rest of the industry wasn't quite so rosy, emphasizing that retailers just own too much brick and mortar space. \n\"There is no question, there is too much square footage in the industry now,\" he said. \nAnd while Walmart certainly commands a lot of real estate, Cast seemed confident that even with more closures, the retailer could still keep much of its U.S. customer base within close range.
