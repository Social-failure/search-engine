China says it is committed to enforcing U.N. sanctions but that all parties need to do more to reduce tensions and restart talks. \nJapanese Foreign Ministry spokesman Norio Maruyama told reporters that China and Japan are aiming to hold several high-level visits this year. These would include Abe visiting China and Xi going to Japan, he said, though no dates have been set. \n“Let’s see. It’s all a question of the schedule,” he said.
