He said that deploying customer payloads on a second test flight \"is almost unprecedented.\"\nThe company last May reached space with its first test launch, only to abort the mission due to a communication glitch. It has official approval to conduct three test launches and sees an emerging market in delivering small devices, some as big as a smartphone, into orbit.\nThe satellites would be used for everything from monitoring crops to providing internet service.\nThe next launch is scheduled to take place in early 2018.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-21T08:10:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-22T01:08:52.005+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
