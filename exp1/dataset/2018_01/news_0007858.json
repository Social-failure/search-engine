Three weeks ago, a senior tax official was shot in his car in Sofia downtown. \nAccording to Transparency International, Bulgaria is the EU’s most corrupt country. But a week before Hristov was shot, President Rumen Radev vetoed anti-graft legislation, saying the bill failed to offer the means to effectively investigate corruption networks.
