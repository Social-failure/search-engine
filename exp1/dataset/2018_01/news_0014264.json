Fujifilm is trying to streamline its copier business with a larger focus on document solutions services.\nXerox, which pioneered photocopiers, and Fujifilm already have a five-decade old Tokyo-based copier joint venture focusing on the Asia Pacific region including Japan and China, leaving Xerox to cover the rest of the world.\nThe Journal report on Wednesday cited people familiar with the matter.
