Southwest shares climbed more than 31 percent in 2017.\nLike its rivals, Delta is grappling with higher fuel and labor costs. The airline said more expensive fuel ate into its operating margin last quarter, bringing it to an expected 11 percent.\nDespite the challenges, Delta said unit revenue, the amount it collects for each seat it flies, likely rose about 4 percent in busy, holiday-filled December, from a year earlier.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-03T19:41:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-03T19:42:05.017+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
