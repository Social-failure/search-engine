Cost-cutting actions were under way, the company said, and that it would start to see significant benefits “in 2020 and later”.\n“Ford’s strategy will take several years to take hold ... and the company will face plenty of risks in the interim. We expect the Street’s overall take will be neutral to negative,” Deutsche Bank analyst Rod Lache wrote in a note.\nThe No. 2 U.S. automaker said its business structure was “out of sync” with its revenue, and plans to cut the number of passenger-car models and develop more trucks and sport utility vehicles focused on profitable niches like rugged off-road models.\nJonas termed Ford’s story a vague, unstructured one compared with larger rival General Motors Co <GM.N >, which shows a more “air tight” message related to growth plans.\nHe added that GM’s product mix is concentrated on hotter segments, and it had done far greater development and communication around newer ventures into self-driving cars and ride-sharing.\nUp to Tuesday’s close, Ford’s stock had risen 3.7 percent in the past 12 months, underperforming an 18.3 percent increase in GM’s shares. The Dow Jones U.S. Automobiles and Parts index increased about 22 percent in the same period.\nFord will report fourth-quarter results after markets close on Jan. 24, while GM will report in early February.
