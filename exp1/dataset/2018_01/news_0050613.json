Operations at the mine in eastern Australia partially resumed in mid-July after a minor earthquake forced Newcrest to suspend operations in April.\nProduction at the Papua New Guinea mine, Lihir, was expected to be higher but was affected by a motor failure in one of its SAG, or semi-autogenous grinding, mills, the company said.\nNewcrest expects gold production in the second half of 2018 to be higher than the first half, as Cadia East ore production ramps up and there are fewer planned shutdown events at Lihir.\nThe rise in output and a cheaper power agreement, which the miner entered into in December, drove Newcrest’s cost of production on an all-in sustaining basis to $829 per ounce from $478 a year ago.\nReporting by Chandini Monnappa in Bengaluru; Editing by Peter Cooney\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-01-30T06:33:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-30T18:51:43.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
