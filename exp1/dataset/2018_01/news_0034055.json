The telecoms sector has lagged the market for months, but hopes of dealmaking drew investors in, sending the index .SXKP up 1.4 percent. \nFrench drugmaker Sanofi ( SASY.PA ) fell 2.9 percent after the company announced an $11.6 billion takeover of U.S. hemophilia treatment specialist Bioverativ ( BIVV.O ), with some traders saying the deal looked expensive. \nKepler Cheuvreux analysts said the deal raised a “host of questions” and wondered whether Bioverativ’s pipeline could offset pressure from a rival Roche treatment. \nSwedish firm Sobi ( SOBIV.ST ), a partner to Bioverativ, soared 16.5 percent. \nCartier owner Richemont’s ( CFR.S ) offer for full control of online luxury retailer Yoox Net-a-Porter ( YNAP.MI ) sent the Italian stock surging 24 percent to a record high. \n“Given the lack of interesting acquisition targets up for sale in their core business of hard luxury, Richemont has decided to put at work its big cash pile investing into distribution channels,” wrote Bernstein analysts. \nRichemont shares closed down 1.6 percent as investors digested the up-to-2.8 billion euro ($3.4 billion) offer, a nearly 26 percent premium over YNAP’s closing price on Friday. \nUBS ( UBSG.S ), Switzerland’s biggest bank, recovered after an early fall when it reported a quarterly loss, driven by a large writedown on the U.S. tax reforms. UBS still boosted its dividends and announced a new share buyback program, and the stock was up 0.4 percent at the close. \nRetailers .SXRP performed well thanks to a 27.5 percent jump from UK online grocer Ocado ( OCDO.L ) after it signed an agreement with Sobeys SOBEF.UL to develop the online grocery business at Canada’s second-largest food retailer. \nGermany-listed shares in South African retailer Steinhoff ( SNHG.DE ) ( SRRJ.J ) rose more than 11 percent after the firm sold its 13.5 percent stake in investment firm PSG Group for 7.1 billion rand ($587 million) as it scrambled to plug a liquidity hole.
