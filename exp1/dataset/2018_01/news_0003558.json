Concerns about rising violence and corruption have hammered Pena Nieto’s popularity.\nViolence has in the past flared up during elections in areas of the country where gangs seek to influence local politics.\nReporting by Lizbeth Diaz; Editing by Sandra Maler\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-04T04:27:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-04T04:41:03.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
