Pope Francis, the first Latin American pope, will visit the majority Catholic nation of Chile over four days.\n“He (the pope) is very conscious about the issues of indigenous people so I‘m sure he will say something about that and it would really help raise visibility,” Tauli-Corpuz said.\nBut the Pope is likely to face protests from some Mapuche during this tour as the community has blamed the Catholic Church for complicity in the seizure of Mapuche lands.\nIn recent years, churches have been the target of arson attacks carried out by a resistance Mapuche group calling itself ‘Weichan Auka Mapu’.\nAccording to Munoz, many Mapuche will be sceptical that the Pope’s visit will make any real difference to their lives.\n“The Pope’s visit will generate media interest but the Pope doesn’t represent any authority for us,” Munoz said.\nAfter Chile, Pope Francis heads to Peru and the jungle city of Puerto Maldonado to focus on the problems facing Amazon indigenous communities struggling against deforestation.\nReporting by Anastasia Moloney @anastasiabogota, Editing by Ros Russell.; Please credit the Thomson Reuters Foundation, the charitable arm of Thomson Reuters, that covers humanitarian news, women's rights, trafficking, property rights, climate change and resilience.
