The employee who transmitted the alert said in a written statement to Hawaii that he or she believed it was an actual alert.\nThe FCC said that Hawaii has been testing alert capabilities, and the employee mistook a drill for a real warning about a missile threat. He responded by sending the alert without sign-off from a supervisor.\nThe name of the worker hasn't been released. He still works at Hawaii Emergency Management Agency but has been reassigned to a job without access to the warning system.\nThe alert was sent to cellphones, TV and radio stations in Hawaii, leading people to fear the state was under nuclear attack. It took 38 minutes for officials to send an alert retracting the warning.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-30T18:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-30T18:29:58.013+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
