The timing is a bit later than Oil Search has previously flagged but in line with analysts’ expectations.\nThe rise in revenue was also underpinned by a 16 percent rise in crude oil prices in the December quarter.\nQuarterly sales volume, however, fell 6 percent to 7.67 mmboe, Oil Search added.\nShares of Oil Search climbed 0.4 percent in early trade compared with a 0.5 percent rise in the benchmark index.
