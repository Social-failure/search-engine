Jan Koum, co-founder of WhatsApp and a Facebook board member, made 16 sales throughout 2017 worth a whopping $2.8 billion. \nThat's the most of any top executive at the five most valuable U.S. tech firms. \nThe only other tech leader to sell anywhere close to that amount of stock was Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos, who sold $2 billion worth. Bezos said in April that he sells about $1 billion a year in Amazon stock to help fund his space exploration project, Blue Origin.\nOther notable sellers among the big five tech firms this year included Google CEO Sundar Pichai, who's cashed in $84.3 million of Alphabet shares, and Apple CEO Tim Cook, who sold $60 million of that stock.\nNotably, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella sold no shares last year, nor did Alphabet CEO Larry Page. \nHere's a list of the top-selling Facebook executives for 2017:\nJan Koum, CEO, WhatsApp, director - $2.825 billion Mark Zuckerberg, CEO and chair - $942 million Sheryl Sandberg, COO, director - $316.3 million Michael Schroepfer, CTO - $70.98 million Chris Cox, chief product officer - $59.8 million David Wehner, CFO - $14.1 million The majority of these Facebook sales were made via regular trading plans filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-08T23:12:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-08T23:12:51.022+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
