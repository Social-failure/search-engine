Steinhoff owns 16 percent of PSG, which has a total market value of around 60 billion rand.\nSteinhoff last month shocked investors with the disclosure of what it said were irregularities in its accounts which helped to wipe about $15 billion, or 85 percent, off its market value.\nHowever, it said in a statement on Monday the placement would only go ahead if it achieved acceptable pricing. “Steinhoff will not dispose of the Placing Shares at all costs, as the Placing is being undertaken in order to be pro-active and prudent,” it said.\nSteinhoff’s top two executives have resigned, as well as its chairman, and the group is currently being run by an acting chief executive while its former finance chief works full-time on securing financing.\nSources familiar with the matter had told Reuters last month that Steinhoff was considering selling stakes worth a combined $1.4 billion in PSG Group and KAP Industrial to raise much-needed funds.\nSteinhoff owns 39 percent of diversified industrial group KAP, which is worth around 22.4 billion rand at current market prices.\nPSG Capital Proprietary Limited and The Standard Bank of South Africa Limited are acting as joint bookrunners for the placement in PSG shares.\n$1 = 12.0875 rand Reporting by Maria Sheahan; Editing by Sherry Jacob-Phillips and Kenneth Maxwell\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-01-22T15:15:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-23T17:51:51.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
