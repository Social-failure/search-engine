The poll was based on an 80 percent sample.\nOther stations gave a mixed picture, suggesting the vote was too close to call.\nThe two leading candidates to emerge from Sunday’s election will have to seek support from the seven other candidates ahead of the Feb. 4 run-off vote.\nReporting By Michele Kambas; Editing by David Goodman\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-28T18:18:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-28T18:37:02.033+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
