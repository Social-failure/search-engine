S. Military,\" said Stephen Brackett, director of BioDirection. \"General Hammond has a passion for the safety and well-being of our military developed over his distinguished career in the U.S. Army. We are indeed fortunate to have a man of his experience on our team.\"\nDuring his distinguished 30-year military career in the U.S. Army, General Hammond commanded troops at the platoon, troop, battalion, and brigade level both at home and abroad, becoming the first Massachusetts officer to achieve the rank of general officer in a combat theater since World War II.

The Boston-based organization provides a unique, intensive clinical care program, fitness and wellness-based programs, and education and research.\n\"I have worked closely with Steve Brackett through Home Base, and as a result have observed the development of BioDirection over the last few years,\" said General Hammond. \"The time is right for the company to aggressively pursue military applications for its point-of-care Tbit™ System, which is well-suited for use in both military training and deployment situations.\"\nAfter a brief deployment to Afghanistan in 2002, General Hammond deployed to Iraq in 2003 with the invasion force and simultaneously commanded two battalions; Task Force Patriot in Balad performing stability and security operations, and Task Force Enforcer in Fallujah conducting counter-insurgent operations. In Kabul, Afghanistan from 2011-2012, General Hammond commanded Task Force Yankee as the senior U.S. commander for Kabul Province. He was responsible for a multi-national security force of 3,000 personnel, providing security and support for 11 U.S. installations and 10,000 coalition members conducting counterinsurgency operations, humanitarian assistance, and area support missions.\nGeneral Hammond is the recipient of numerous military awards including the Distinguished Service Medal, the Legion of Merit with Oak Leaf Cluster, Bronze Star Medal, Army Commendation Medal for Valor with Oak Leaf Cluster, French Medal of National Defense, and Bulgarian Medal of Mission Support.
