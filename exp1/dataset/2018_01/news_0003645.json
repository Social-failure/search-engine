We’ll be fully covered, with crews,” Kjos told a news conference.\nThe company’s bookings for the coming year are also stronger than they were at the same time a year ago, even when taking into account the growth in its fleet, he added.\nReporting by Joachim Dagenborg, editing by Terje Solsvik\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-04T17:21:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-04T17:44:50.023+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
