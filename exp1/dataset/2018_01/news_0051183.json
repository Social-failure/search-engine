It has a majority share in the country’s ride-hailing market with operations in more than 110 cities.\nThe company, also expanding into the food delivery business, has tied up with Microsoft Corp to build a connected car platform and is experimenting with electric vehicles.\nJapan’s SoftBank Group Corp is the biggest investor in both Ola and Uber.\nReporting by Sankalp Phartiyal; Editing by Jacqueline Wong\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-30T05:45:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-30T06:04:20.105+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
