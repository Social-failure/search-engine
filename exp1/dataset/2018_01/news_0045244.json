The tiles generate electricity without the need for a traditional panel. Tesla also has plans to build conventional panels using imported cells for its U.S.-based residential installation business, which it also hopes to grow over the coming years.\nTesla said on Tuesday it expects to be able to import “some or all of our non-U.S. cells for Solar Roof and solar panel modules free of tariffs.”\nOnly 500 MW worth of solar cells were imported into the United States in total last year, according to the Solar Energy Industries Association, a fifth of what is being exempted from Trump’s tariff.\nBaird analyst Ben Kallo agreed the tariff was generally positive for Tesla as it will make its domestic products more competitive with imports - though he noted its installation business will pay higher prices for imported panels in the short term. Tesla shares rose $1.23, or 0.3 percent, to close at $352.79 on Tuesday.\nTesla had been part of a group of domestic manufacturers that lobbied against tariffs on solar products.
