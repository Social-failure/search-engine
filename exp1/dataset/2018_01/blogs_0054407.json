It wants to see discounts limited to 34% of the wholesale price, and Agriculture and Food Minister Stephane Travert has also come out against “two for the price of one” promotions, in order to “give value back to products.”\nAccording to The Local , last week’s Nutella-induced mayhem caused a great deal of soul-searching in French media, with sociologists proclaiming the end of French solidarity.\nFortune has asked Intermarch? for comment and will update the story when it arrives.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-30T12:23:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-30T12:24:10.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
