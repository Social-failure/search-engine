( apple.co/2E3LX6a ) \nHowever, the company did not specify exactly when that update would be available, saying only that it would come after the planned release of iOS 11.3 this spring that adds a slew of new animojis and features for its health app. Reporting by Sonam Rai and Arjun Panchadar in Bengaluru; Editing by Supriya Kurane", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-24T15:47:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-24T16:02:11.010+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
