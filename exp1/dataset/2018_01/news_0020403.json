It has started a search for a replacement, it said.\nSeb James, chief executive of Dixons Carphone, said Singer had played a vital role in the transformation of the company, and would leave the business in a healthy financial position.\nSinger’s strong track record, however, was slightly tarnished when the company warned on profit in August, sending its shares down by as much as 30 percent.\nSeparately, Dixons Carphone was fined 400,000 pounds on Wednesday after the personal data of more than 3 million of its customers was exposed in a cyber attack in 2015.\nIts shares were flat at 203 pence at 1045 GMT, while M&S&rsquo;s were up 1.8 percent at 324 pence.\nM&S will update on Christmas trading on Thursday. Dixons Carphone is set to release a trading statement on Jan. 23.\n$1 = 0.7383 pounds Reporting by Paul Sandle; Editing by James Davey and Mark Potter\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-01-10T19:34:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-11T12:37:05.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
