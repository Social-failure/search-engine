It’s been spoken of for years, and children are now adults in many cases,” Trump said, noting that hundreds of thousands of people were affected by the policy. But he added, “Above all else, any bill we pass must improve jobs, wages and security for American citizens.” (Reporting by Steve Holland; Writing by David Alexander; Editing by Lisa Lambert)\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-01-11T01:44:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-11T12:37:45.019+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
