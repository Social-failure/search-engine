Included in the fourth quarter financial results were one-time charges resulting from the re-measurement of Trustmark’s net deferred tax assets due to the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (Tax Reform Act) and the elimination of a deferred tax valuation allowance related to a prior merger, which collectively reduced net income by $17.0 million, or $0.25 per diluted share. Adjusting for these items, net income in the fourth quarter totaled $32.7 million, representing diluted earnings per share of $0.48, an increase of 11.6% when compared to the same period in the prior year.\nThis press release features multimedia. View the full release here: http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180123006336/en/\nPrinter friendly version of earnings release with consolidated financial statements and notes: http://www.businesswire.com/cgi-bin/mmg.cgi?eid=51747177&lang=en\nFor the full year, Trustmark’s net income totaled $105.6 million, which represented diluted earnings per share of $1.56. Excluding the one-time charges referenced above as well as the non-routine items related to the termination of Trustmark’s defined benefit pension plan ($10.9 million), the RB Bancorporation merger ($2.0 million) and the non-taxable proceeds related to life insurance ($4.9 million), diluted earnings per share were $1.92 in 2017. Excluding non-routine items, diluted earnings per share were $1.70 in 2016.\nTrustmark’s Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.23 per share payable March 15, 2018, to shareholders of record on March 1, 2018.\n2017 Highlights\nLoans held for investment increased $718.8 million, or 9.2%, during the year Credit quality remained solid as net charge-offs represented 11 basis points of average loans Deposits increased $521.5 million, or 5.2% Expanded presence in attractive Huntsville, Alabama MSA with the merger of RB Bancorporation Revenue totaled $592.2 million, an increase of $30.7 million, or 5.5%\nGerard R. Host, President and CEO, stated, “Trustmark made significant accomplishments in 2017. We continued to provide customers with the products and services they desired as evidenced by our fourth consecutive year of robust loan growth and solid performance across our financial services businesses. Our Mortgage Banking, Insurance Services and Wealth Management businesses posted another year of solid results. We expanded our digital banking platform with the introduction of myTrustmark ® Business, which was well received by our customers. We also made investments to enhance our customer contact center as well as to replace legacy-banking systems. In addition, we continued to realign delivery channels in response to changing customer preferences and embraced opportunities to enhance efficiency and profitability. Trustmark is well-positioned to meet the needs of our customers and create long-term value for our shareholders.”\nBalance Sheet Management\nContinued balance sheet optimization as maturing investment securities were replaced with organic loan growth Deposit costs remained well controlled\nLoans held for investment totaled $8.6 billion at December 31, 2017, an increase of 1.9% from the prior quarter and 9.2% from the same period one year earlier. Compared to the prior quarter, construction, land development and other land loans expanded $37.5 million, driven by growth in construction loans in Alabama. Other real estate secured loans increased by $35.8 million over the prior quarter, as growth in Mississippi and Alabama offset a minimal decrease in Tennessee. Loans secured by 1-4 family residential properties grew $26.6 million quarter over quarter, principally due to growth in Mississippi and Alabama. Other loans, which include loans to nonprofits and financial intermediaries, increased $25.4 million as growth in Mississippi, Texas and Tennessee more than offset declines in Alabama and Florida.\nAcquired loans totaled $261.5 million at December 31, 2017, down $22.2 million from the prior quarter. Collectively, loans held for investment and acquired loans totaled $8.8 billion at December 31, 2017, up 1.6% from the prior quarter and 8.7% from the prior year.\nDeposits totaled $10.6 billion at December 31, 2017, an increase of $345.8 million, or 3.4%, from the previous quarter and $521.5 million, or 5.2%, year-over-year. Trustmark continues to maintain an attractive, low-cost deposit base with approximately 59% of deposits in checking accounts and a total cost of deposits of 0.28%. The total cost of interest-bearing liabilities was 0.56% for the fourth quarter of 2017.\nTrustmark’s capital position remained solid, reflecting the consistent profitability of its diversified financial services businesses. At December 31, 2017, Trustmark’s tangible equity to tangible assets ratio was 8.77%, while its total risk-based capital ratio was 13.10%. Tangible book value per share was $17.35 at December 31, 2017, up 3.5% year-over-year.\nCredit Quality\nAllowance for loan losses represented 320.8% of nonperforming loans, excluding specifically reviewed impaired loans Other real estate declined $5.1 million in the fourth quarter and $18.8 million year-over-year\nNonperforming loans totaled $67.6 million at December 31, 2017, down 2.5% from the prior quarter and up 37.3% year-over-year. Other real estate totaled $43.2 million, reflecting a 10.6% linked-quarter decrease and a 30.3% year-over-year reduction. Collectively, nonperforming assets totaled $110.8 million, reflecting a linked-quarter and year-over-year decrease of 5.8% and 0.4%, respectively.\nAllocation of Trustmark's $76.7 million allowance for loan losses represented 0.95% of commercial loans and 0.68% of consumer and home mortgage loans, resulting in an allowance to total loans held for investment of 0.90% at December 31, 2017. This represents a level management considers commensurate with the inherent risk in the loan portfolio. In aggregate, the allowance for both held for investment and acquired loan losses represented 0.92% of total loans held for investment and acquired loans.\nNet charge-offs totaled $9.3 million in the fourth quarter resulting from two impaired loans being written-down to collateral value. One of the credits was impaired and reserved earlier in the year, while the other was an existing substandard credit that was impaired, provisioned and written-down during the fourth quarter.\nUnless noted otherwise, all of the above credit quality metrics exclude acquired loans.\nRevenue Generation\nNet interest income (FTE) excluding acquired loans in 2017 totaled $402.9 million, up 7.2% from the prior year Noninterest income in 2017 totaled $184.7 million, up 6.2% from the prior year\nRevenue in the fourth quarter totaled $148.0 million, down 0.3% from the prior quarter, reflecting in part a seasonal reduction in noninterest income. Net interest income (FTE) in the fourth quarter totaled $109.1 million, resulting in a net interest margin of 3.48%. Compared to the prior quarter, net interest income (FTE) increased $214 thousand primarily due to growth in interest income (FTE) from the held for sale and held for investment loan portfolios, which was offset in part by decreased yields on the securities portfolio. During the fourth quarter of 2017, the yield on acquired loans totaled 9.27% and included $1.1 million in recoveries from the settlement of debt, which represented approximately 1.63% of the annualized total acquired loan yield. Excluding acquired loans, the net interest margin for the fourth quarter of 2017 remained stable compared to the third quarter of 2017, as increased yields on the loans held for investment and held for sale portfolio were offset by decreased yields on the securities portfolio and higher costs of interest-bearing deposits and other borrowings. Net interest income (FTE) in 2017 totaled $427.3 million, resulting in a net interest margin (FTE) of 3.48%; excluding acquired loans, the net interest margin (FTE) was 3.36%.\nNoninterest income totaled $44.0 million in the fourth quarter, down from the prior quarter primarily because of seasonally lower insurance commissions. In the fourth quarter, bank card and other fees totaled $7.3 million, an increase of 1.6% from the prior quarter, while service charges on deposit accounts totaled $11.2 million, down 0.3% from the prior quarter. Other income, net decreased $1.1 million linked quarter, primarily due to a decline in other miscellaneous income.\nInsurance revenue in the fourth quarter totaled $8.8 million, reflecting a seasonal decrease of 15.2% from the prior quarter and an increase of 4.2% compared to one year earlier. Insurance revenue in 2017 totaled $38.2 million, up $1.4 million relative to the prior year. The solid performance in 2017 reflects increased business development efforts and initiatives that supported enhanced productivity.\nWealth management revenue totaled $7.7 million in the fourth quarter, an increase of 2.6% when compared to the prior quarter and 2.9% from levels one year earlier. The year-over-year increase is primarily attributable to higher retail brokerage income. Wealth management revenue in 2017 totaled $30.3 million, in-line with the prior year. Trustmark remained focused on servicing clients and realigned processes to enhance productivity.\nMortgage banking revenue in the fourth quarter totaled $6.3 million, up $1.9 million from the prior quarter. The linked-quarter increase is primarily attributable to reduced net negative hedge ineffectiveness. Mortgage loan production in the fourth quarter totaled $337.5 million, a seasonal decrease of 1.2% from the prior quarter and a 17.0% decrease year-over-year, primarily due to lower refinancing activity and rising interest rates.\nIn 2017, mortgage banking revenue totaled $29.9 million, up 6.0% from the prior year as a net positive mortgage servicing hedge ineffectiveness and increased mortgage servicing income were offset in part by lower secondary marketing gains. Mortgage loan production totaled $1.4 billion in 2017, down 15.6% from the prior year primarily due to an extremely competitive third party origination environment.\nNoninterest Expense and Taxes\nCore noninterest expense in 2017 totaled $399.5 million Continued realignment of retail delivery channel Trustmark estimates its annual effective income tax rate will decrease to approximately 12% to 14% beginning in 2018 primarily as a result of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017\nCore noninterest expense, which excludes other real estate expense ($666 thousand), intangible amortization ($1.5 million) and non-recurring items, totaled $100.8 million in the fourth quarter, an increase of $80 thousand on a comparable basis from the prior quarter and $3.6 million from the prior year.\nSalaries and benefits totaled $59.8 million in the fourth quarter, up 1.6% linked quarter primarily due to increased expense related to incentive compensation programs. Services and fees increased 1.9% from the prior quarter, reflecting higher spending on outside services and fees and advertising. Other real estate expense totaled $666 thousand during the fourth quarter, representing a 22.9% decrease compared to the prior quarter.\nTrustmark’s fourth quarter and year ended effective income tax rate equaled 61.4% and 31.6%, respectively. Excluding the impact of the re-measurement of net deferred tax assets of $25.6 million related to the Tax Reform Act and the elimination of the deferred tax valuation allowance of $8.7 million during the fourth quarter, Trustmark’s fourth quarter and year ended effective tax rate would have been 19.9% and 20.6%, respectively. Beginning in 2018, Trustmark estimates its annual effective income tax rate will be approximately 12% to 14% primarily as a result of the Tax Reform Act. Trustmark’s effective income tax rate continues to be less than the statutory rate primarily due to various tax-exempt income items and its utilization of income tax credit programs.\nTrustmark is committed to developing and maintaining relationships, supporting investments that promote profitable revenue growth and realigning retail delivery channels to support changing customer preferences. During 2017, Trustmark consolidated three branch offices and reallocated a portion of those resources to opening a new banking center. Over the last five years, Trustmark has consolidated 38 branch offices with limited growth potential and established 10 banking centers in attractive growth markets. In addition, Trustmark is piloting myTeller℠, an interactive video teller service provided through a centralized teller center which delivers most functions provided by traditional tellers. The potential applications for this technology include deployment beyond the traditional branch network and expanded service hours, further enhancing customer convenience and improving operational efficiency. Trustmark also introduced myTrustmark ® Business, an enhanced and robust digital banking service for commercial customers to meet growing mobile and online demand. Trustmark remains committed to investments that promote profitable revenue growth as well as reengineering and efficiency opportunities that enhance long-term shareholder value.\nAdditional Information\nAs previously announced, Trustmark will conduct a conference call with analysts on Wednesday, January 24, 2018, at 8:30 a.m. Central Time to discuss the Corporation’s financial results.

Reliance Bank was merged into Trustmark National Bank simultaneously with the merger of Trustmark and RB Bancorporation. Under the terms of the Merger Agreement dated November 14, 2016, Trustmark paid $22.00 in cash for each share of Reliance common stock outstanding, which represented total consideration for Reliance common shareholders of approximately $23.7 million.\nThe merger with Reliance was consistent with Trustmark’s strategic plan to selectively expand the Trustmark franchise and enhance the Trustmark franchise in north Alabama.\nThis merger was accounted for in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) Topic 805, “Business Combinations.” Accordingly, the assets and liabilities, both tangible and intangible, were recorded at their estimated fair values as of the merger date. The fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed are subject to adjustment if additional information relative to the closing date fair values becomes available through the measurement period, which is not to exceed one year from the merger date of April 7, 2017.\nThe statement of assets purchased and liabilities assumed in the Reliance merger is presented below at their estimated fair values as of the merger date of April 7, 2017 ($ in thousands):\nAssets: Cash and due from banks $ 5,013 Federal funds sold and securities purchased under reverse repurchase agreements 6,900 Securities 54,843 Acquired loans 117,447 Premises and equipment, net 3,700 Identifiable intangible assets 1,850 Other real estate 475 Other assets 6,037 Total assets 196,265 Liabilities: Deposits 166,158 Other borrowings 17,469 Other liabilities 1,322 Total liabilities 184,949 Net identifiable assets acquired at fair value 11,316 Goodwill 13,472 Net assets acquired at fair value $ 24,788 The excess of the consideration paid over the estimated fair value of the net assets acquired was $13.5 million, which was recorded as goodwill under FASB ASC Topic 805. The identifiable intangible assets acquired represent the core deposit intangible at fair value at the merger date. The core deposit intangible is being amortized on an accelerated basis over the estimated useful life, currently expected to be approximately ten years.\nLoans acquired from Reliance were evaluated under a fair value process. Loans with evidence of deterioration in credit quality and for which it was probable at acquisition that Trustmark would not be able to collect all contractually required payments are referred to as acquired impaired loans and accounted for in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 310-30, “Loans and Debt Securities Acquired with Deteriorated Credit Quality.”\nThe operations of Reliance are included in Trustmark’s operating results from April 7, 2017 and did not have a material impact on Trustmark’s results of operations. During the second quarter of 2017, Trustmark included non-routine merger transaction expenses in other noninterest expense totaling $3.2 million (change in control expense of $1.3 million; professional fees, contract termination and other expenses of $1.9 million).\nTRUSTMARK CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIALS December 31, 2017 ($ in thousands) (unaudited) Note 2 - Securities Available for Sale and Held to Maturity\nThe following table is a summary of the estimated fair value of securities available for sale and the amortized cost of securities held to maturity ($ in thousands):\n12/31/2017 9/30/2017 6/30/2017 3/31/2017 12/31/2016 SECURITIES AVAILABLE FOR SALE\nU.S. Government agency obligations Issued by U.S. Government agencies $ 45,018 $ 49,723 $ 51,277 $ 53,247 $ 55,763 Issued by U.S. Government sponsored agencies 267 271 272 274 276 Obligations of states and political subdivisions 79,229 89,144 96,514 109,895 115,373 Mortgage-backed securities Residential mortgage pass-through securities Guaranteed by GNMA 65,746 60,902 58,422 42,667 42,786 Issued by FNMA and FHLMC 814,450 860,131 860,571 733,214 631,084 Other residential mortgage-backed securities Issued or guaranteed by FNMA, FHLMC, or GNMA 1,016,790 1,087,169 1,157,241 1,202,719 1,267,951 Commercial mortgage-backed securities Issued or guaranteed by FNMA, FHLMC, or GNMA 217,135 221,749 223,391 223,538 243,449 Total securities available for sale $ 2,238,635 $ 2,369,089 $ 2,447,688 $ 2,365,554 $ 2,356,682 SECURITIES HELD TO MATURITY\nU.S. Government agency obligations Issued by U.S. Government sponsored agencies $ 3,692 $ 3,680 $ 3,669 $ 3,658 $ 3,647 Obligations of states and political subdivisions 46,039 46,069 46,098 46,273 46,303 Mortgage-backed securities Residential mortgage pass-through securities Guaranteed by GNMA 13,539 14,191 14,399 14,977 15,478 Issued by FNMA and FHLMC 133,975 139,172 144,282 118,733 81,299 Other residential mortgage-backed securities Issued or guaranteed by FNMA, FHLMC, or GNMA 678,926 708,715 740,042 771,296 803,474 Commercial mortgage-backed securities Issued or guaranteed by FNMA, FHLMC, or GNMA 180,315 190,456 191,264 201,130 208,442 Total securities held to maturity $ 1,056,486 $ 1,102,283 $ 1,139,754 $ 1,156,067 $ 1,158,643 At December 31, 2017, the net unamortized, unrealized loss included in accumulated other comprehensive loss in the accompanying balance sheet for securities held to maturity previously transferred from securities available for sale totaled approximately $19.5 million ($12.0 million, net of tax).\nManagement continues to focus on asset quality as one of the strategic goals of the securities portfolio, which is evidenced by the investment of approximately 96% of the portfolio in GSE-backed obligations and other Aaa rated securities as determined by Moody’s. None of the securities owned by Trustmark are collateralized by assets which are considered sub-prime. Furthermore, outside of stock ownership in the Federal Home Loan Bank of Dallas, Federal Home Loan Bank of Atlanta and Federal Reserve Bank, Trustmark does not hold any other equity investment in a GSE.\nTRUSTMARK CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIALS December 31, 2017 ($ in thousands) (unaudited) Note 3 – Loan Composition\nLHFI BY TYPE (excluding acquired loans)\n12/31/2017 9/30/2017 6/30/2017 3/31/2017 12/31/2016 Loans secured by real estate: Construction, land development and other land loans $ 987,624 $ 950,144 $ 922,029 $ 859,927 $ 831,437 Secured by 1-4 family residential properties 1,675,311 1,648,733 1,655,968 1,656,837 1,660,043 Secured by nonfarm, nonresidential properties 2,193,823 2,172,885 2,109,367 2,064,352 2,034,176 Other real estate secured 517,956 482,163 432,208 399,636 318,148 Commercial and industrial loans 1,570,345 1,568,588 1,635,000 1,540,783 1,528,434 Consumer loans 171,918 173,061 170,858 166,314 170,562 State and other political subdivision loans 952,483 936,614 936,860 910,493 917,515 Other loans 500,507 475,153 433,755 406,315 390,898 LHFI 8,569,967 8,407,341 8,296,045 8,004,657 7,851,213 Allowance for loan losses (76,733) (80,332) (76,184) (72,445) (71,265) Net LHFI $ 8,493,234 $ 8,327,009 $ 8,219,861 $ 7,932,212 $ 7,779,948 During the third quarter of 2017, Trustmark increased its allowance for loan losses by $1.1 million due to the potential loss exposure caused by Hurricane Harvey.\nACQUIRED LOANS BY TYPE (1)\n12/31/2017 9/30/2017 6/30/2017 3/31/2017 12/31/2016 Loans secured by real estate: Construction, land development and other land loans $ 23,586 $ 29,384 $ 35,054 $ 17,651 $ 20,850 Secured by 1-4 family residential properties 61,751 65,746 74,313 54,721 69,540 Secured by nonfarm, nonresidential properties 114,694 122,200 132,663 92,075 103,820 Other real estate secured 16,746 18,431 19,553 16,275 19,010 Commercial and industrial loans 31,506 34,124 34,375 20,691 36,896 Consumer loans 2,600 2,749 2,833 2,664 3,365 Other loans 10,634 11,123 16,119 14,165 18,766 Acquired loans 261,517 283,757 314,910 218,242 272,247 Allowance for loan losses, acquired loans (4,079) (5,768) (7,423) (10,006) (11,397) Net acquired loans $ 257,438 $ 277,989 $ 307,487 $ 208,236 $ 260,850 (1) Trustmark revised the presentation of acquired loans by eliminating the segmentation of acquired noncovered loans and acquired covered loans due to the significantly reduced size of the acquired covered loan portfolio.\nDuring the first quarter of 2017, Trustmark transferred the remaining balance of the acquired loans not accounted for under FASB ASC Topic 310-30, “Loans and Debt Securities Acquired with Deteriorated Credit Quality” to LHFI due to the discount on these loans being fully amortized.

In addition, the table includes net interest margin excluding acquired loans, which equals reported net interest income-FTE excluding interest income on acquired loans, annualized, as a percent of average earning assets excluding average acquired loans.\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2017, the yield on acquired loans totaled 9.27% and included $1.1 million in recoveries from the settlement of debt, which represented approximately 1.63% of the annualized total acquired loan yield. Excluding acquired loans, the net interest margin for the fourth quarter of 2017 remained relatively flat compared to the third quarter of 2017, as increased yields on the loans held for investment and held for sale portfolio were offset by decreased yields on the securities portfolio and higher costs of interest-bearing deposits and other borrowings.\nNote 5 – Mortgage Banking\nTrustmark utilizes a portfolio of exchange-traded derivative instruments, such as Treasury note futures contracts and option contracts, to achieve a fair value return that offsets the changes in fair value of mortgage servicing rights (MSR) attributable to interest rates. These transactions are considered freestanding derivatives that do not otherwise qualify for hedge accounting under generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). Changes in the fair value of these exchange-traded derivative instruments, including administrative costs, are recorded in noninterest income in mortgage banking, net and are offset by the changes in the fair value of the MSR. The MSR fair value represents the present value of future cash flows, which among other things includes decay and the effect of changes in interest rates. Ineffectiveness of hedging the MSR fair value is measured by comparing the change in value of hedge instruments to the change in the fair value of the MSR asset attributable to changes in interest rates and other market driven changes in valuation inputs and assumptions.\nThe following table illustrates the components of mortgage banking revenues included in noninterest income in the accompanying income statements:\nQuarter Ended Year Ended 12/31/2017 9/30/2017 6/30/2017 3/31/2017 12/31/2016 12/31/2017 12/31/2016 Mortgage servicing income, net $ 5,471 $ 5,295 $ 5,439 $ 5,458 $ 5,218 $ 21,663 $ 20,724 Change in fair value-MSR from runoff (2,605 ) (2,892 ) (2,896 ) (2,387 ) (2,739 ) (10,780 ) (10,106 ) Gain on sales of loans, net 5,300 5,083 5,001 3,550 6,054 18,934 20,535 Other, net (1,120 ) (450 ) 629 772 (2,925 ) (169 ) (84 ) Mortgage banking income before hedge ineffectiveness 7,046 7,036 8,173 7,393 5,608 29,648 31,069 Change in fair value-MSR from market changes 1,168 (2,393 ) (1,291 ) 1,466 13,112 (1,050 ) (406 ) Change in fair value of derivatives (1,930 ) (218 ) 2,126 1,326 (13,292 ) 1,304 (2,451 ) Net (negative) positive hedge ineffectiveness (762 ) (2,611 ) 835 2,792 (180 ) 254 (2,857 ) Mortgage banking, net $ 6,284 $ 4,425 $ 9,008 $ 10,185 $ 5,428 $ 29,902 $ 28,212 TRUSTMARK CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIALS December 31, 2017 ($ in thousands) (unaudited) Note 6 – Salaries and Employee Benefit Plans\nEarly Retirement Program\nDuring the second quarter of 2016, Trustmark announced a voluntary early retirement program (ERP) for associates age 60 and above with five or more years of service. The cost of this program is reflected in a one-time, pre-tax charge of approximately $9.3 million (salaries and employee benefits expense of $9.1 million and other miscellaneous expense of $230 thousand), or $0.085 per basic share net of tax, in Trustmark’s second quarter 2016 earnings. As a result of the ERP, during the third and fourth quarters of 2016, Trustmark incurred additional expense of $236 thousand and $268 thousand, respectively, which primarily resulted from additional settlements from pension lump sum elections.\nDefined Benefit Pension Plan\nTrustmark maintained a noncontributory tax-qualified defined benefit pension plan (Trustmark Capital Accumulation Plan, the “Plan”), in which substantially all associates who began employment prior to 2007 participated. The Plan provided for retirement benefits based on the length of credited service and final average compensation, as defined in the Plan, which vested upon three years of service. Benefit accruals under the plan were frozen in 2009, with the exception of certain associates covered through plans obtained in acquisitions that were subsequently merged into the Plan. As previously reported, on July 26, 2016, the Board of Directors of Trustmark authorized the termination of the Plan, effective as of December 31, 2016. To satisfy commitments made by Trustmark to associates (collectively, the “Continuing Associates”) covered through acquired plans that were merged into the Plan, the Board also approved the spin-off of the portion of the Plan associated with the accrued benefits of the Continuing Associates into a new plan titled the Trustmark Corporation Pension Plan for Certain Employees of Acquired Financial Institutions (the “Spin-Off Plan”), effective as of December 31, 2016, immediately prior to the termination of the Plan. In order to terminate the Plan, in accordance with Internal Revenue Service and Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation requirements, Trustmark was required to fully fund the Plan on a termination basis and contributed the additional assets necessary to do so. The final distributions were made from current plan assets and a one-time pension settlement expense of $17.6 million was recognized when paid by Trustmark during the second quarter of 2017. After the distribution of Plan assets during the second quarter of 2017, Trustmark estimates that the annual pension expense will be reduced by $3.0 million to $4.0 million.\nNote 7 – Other Noninterest Income and Expense\nOther noninterest income consisted of the following for the periods presented ($ in thousands):\nQuarter Ended Year Ended 12/31/2017 9/30/2017 6/30/2017 3/31/2017 12/31/2016 12/31/2017 12/31/2016 Partnership amortization for tax credit purposes $ (2,478 ) $ (2,521 ) $ (2,287 ) $ (2,274 ) $ (2,479 ) $ (9,560 ) $ (9,916 ) Increase in life insurance cash surrender value 1,816 1,813 1,782 1,714 1,751 7,125 6,891 Other miscellaneous income 3,343 4,448 6,142 2,451 2,820 16,384 8,651 Total other, net $ 2,681 $ 3,740 $ 5,637 $ 1,891 $ 2,092 $ 13,949 $ 5,626 Trustmark invests in partnerships that provide income tax credits on a Federal and/or State basis (i.e., new market tax credits, low income housing tax credits and historical tax credits). The income tax credits related to these partnerships are utilized as specifically allowed by income tax law and are recorded as a reduction in income tax expense.\nTrustmark received nontaxable proceeds of $1.7 million and $2.7 million related to bank-owned life insurance during the fourth and third quarters of 2017, respectively, and $4.9 million related to life insurance acquired as part of a previous acquisition during the second quarter of 2017, which were recorded in other miscellaneous income in the table above.\nOther noninterest expense consisted of the following for the periods presented ($ in thousands):\nQuarter Ended Year Ended 12/31/2017 9/30/2017 6/30/2017 3/31/2017 12/31/2016 12/31/2017 12/31/2016 Loan expense $ 2,276 $ 3,013 $ 2,827 $ 2,792 $ 2,823 $ 10,908 $ 12,226 Amortization of intangibles 1,522 1,539 1,544 1,564 1,686 6,169 6,866 Other miscellaneous expense 7,799 7,885 10,550 8,432 7,154 34,666 28,838 Total other expense $ 11,597 $ 12,437 $ 14,921 $ 12,788 $ 11,663 $ 51,743 $ 47,930 As previously discussed in Note 1 – Business Combinations, non-routine Reliance merger transaction expenses totaled $3.2 million and were included in other miscellaneous expense during the second quarter of 2017.\nTRUSTMARK CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIALS December 31, 2017 ($ in thousands) (unaudited) Note 8 – Income Taxes\nThe income tax provision consisted of the following for the periods presented ($ in thousands):\nQuarter Ended Year Ended 12/31/2017 9/30/2017 6/30/2017 3/31/2017 12/31/2016 12/31/2017 12/31/2016 Current $ 3,850 $ 8,108 $ 5,427 $ 5,261 $ 3,302 $ 22,646 $ 13,053 Deferred 4,300 600 300 3,900 5,100 9,100 18,000 Elimination of deferred tax valuation allowance (8,650 ) — — — — (8,650 ) — Income tax provision before re-measurement (500 ) 8,708 5,727 9,161 8,402 23,096 31,053 Re-measurement of net deferred tax assets 25,619 — — — — 25,619 — Income tax provision $ 25,119 $ 8,708 $ 5,727 $ 9,161 $ 8,402 $ 48,715 $ 31,053 During 2013, a deferred tax valuation allowance was created as a result of Trustmark’s merger with BancTrust Financial Group, Inc. and was established to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that was more likely than not to be realized in future years. Trustmark has continually evaluated this allowance since inception and, based on the weight of the available evidence, has determined that the deferred tax assets will not be subject to the limitations on the deductibility of built-in losses (Internal Revenue Service Code, Section 382) in future years. Therefore, during the fourth quarter of 2017, the valuation allowance was eliminated creating a decrease in deferred income tax expense of $8.7 million.\nFollowing the recent enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (Tax Reform Act) which resulted in the reduction of the corporate federal income tax rate, Trustmark re-measured its net deferred tax assets and recorded an increase in deferred income tax expense of $25.6 million during the fourth quarter of 2017. In addition, Trustmark estimates its effective income tax rate to decrease from approximately 21% (excluding the elimination of the deferred tax valuation allowance and the re-measurement of net deferred tax assets) in 2017 to approximately 12% to 14% beginning in 2018, primarily as a result of the Tax Reform Act. Trustmark’s effective tax rate continues to be less than the statutory rate primarily due to various tax-exempt income items and its utilization of income tax credit programs.\nNote 9 – Non-GAAP Financial Measures\nIn addition to capital ratios defined by U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) and banking regulators, Trustmark utilizes various tangible common equity measures when evaluating capital utilization and adequacy. Tangible common equity, as defined by Trustmark, represents common equity less goodwill and identifiable intangible assets.\nTrustmark believes these measures are important because they reflect the level of capital available to withstand unexpected market conditions. Additionally, presentation of these measures allows readers to compare certain aspects of Trustmark’s capitalization to other organizations. These ratios differ from capital measures defined by banking regulators principally in that the numerator excludes shareholders’ equity associated with preferred securities, the nature and extent of which varies across organizations. In Management’s experience, many stock analysts use tangible common equity measures in conjunction with more traditional bank capital ratios to compare capital adequacy of banking organizations with significant amounts of goodwill or other tangible assets, typically stemming from the use of the purchase accounting method in accounting for mergers and acquisitions.\nThese calculations are intended to complement the capital ratios defined by GAAP and banking regulators. Because GAAP does not include these capital ratio measures, Trustmark believes there are no comparable GAAP financial measures to these tangible common equity ratios. Despite the importance of these measures to Trustmark, there are no standardized definitions for them and, as a result, Trustmark’s calculations may not be comparable with other organizations. Also there may be limits in the usefulness of these measures to investors. As a result, Trustmark encourages readers to consider its consolidated financial statements in their entirety and not to rely on any single financial measure. The following table reconciles Trustmark’s calculation of these measures to amounts reported under GAAP.\nTRUSTMARK CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIALS December 31, 2017 ($ in thousands) (unaudited) Note 9 – Non-GAAP Financial Measures (continued)\nQuarter Ended Year Ended 12/31/2017 9/30/2017 6/30/2017 3/31/2017 12/31/2016 12/31/2017 12/31/2016 TANGIBLE EQUITY\nAVERAGE BALANCES Total shareholders' equity $ 1,579,633 $ 1,577,867 $ 1,552,240 $ 1,533,098 $ 1,533,144 $ 1,560,884 $ 1,517,955 Less: Goodwill (379,627 ) (379,627 ) (378,191 ) (366,156 ) (366,156 ) (375,947 ) (366,156 ) Identifiable intangible assets (17,196 ) (18,714 ) (19,713 ) (19,950 ) (21,585 ) (18,885 ) (24,132 ) Total average tangible equity $ 1,182,810 $ 1,179,526 $ 1,154,336 $ 1,146,992 $ 1,145,403 $ 1,166,052 $ 1,127,667 PERIOD END BALANCES Total shareholders' equity $ 1,571,701 $ 1,582,535 $ 1,561,918 $ 1,537,961 $ 1,520,208 Less: Goodwill (379,627 ) (379,627 ) (379,627 ) (366,156 ) (366,156 ) Identifiable intangible assets (16,360 ) (17,883 ) (19,422 ) (19,117 ) (20,680 ) Total tangible equity (a) $ 1,175,714 $ 1,185,025 $ 1,162,869 $ 1,152,688 $ 1,133,372 TANGIBLE ASSETS\nTotal assets $ 13,797,953 $ 13,884,655 $ 13,909,138 $ 13,490,361 $ 13,352,333 Less: Goodwill (379,627 ) (379,627 ) (379,627 ) (366,156 ) (366,156 ) Identifiable intangible assets (16,360 ) (17,883 ) (19,422 ) (19,117 ) (20,680 ) Total tangible assets (b) $ 13,401,966 $ 13,487,145 $ 13,510,089 $ 13,105,088 $ 12,965,497 Risk-weighted assets (c) $ 10,566,818 $ 10,498,582 $ 10,391,912 $ 10,031,410 $ 9,952,123 NET INCOME ADJUSTED FOR INTANGIBLE AMORTIZATION\nNet income $ 15,768 $ 34,579 $ 24,035 $ 31,248 $ 28,923 $ 105,630 $ 108,411 Plus: Intangible amortization net of tax 940 950 954 966 1,041 3,810 4,240 Net income adjusted for intangible amortization $ 16,708 $ 35,529 $ 24,989 $ 32,214 $ 29,964 $ 109,440 $ 112,651 Period end common shares outstanding (d) 67,746,094 67,742,135 67,740,901 67,729,434 67,628,618 TANGIBLE COMMON EQUITY MEASUREMENTS\nReturn on average tangible equity (1) 5.60 % 11.95 % 8.68 % 11.39 % 10.41 % 9.39 % 9.99 % Tangible equity/tangible assets (a)/(b) 8.77 % 8.79 % 8.61 % 8.80 % 8.74 % Tangible equity/risk-weighted assets (a)/(c) 11.13 % 11.29 % 11.19 % 11.49 % 11.39 % Tangible book value (a)/(d)*1,000 $ 17.35 $ 17.49 $ 17.17 $ 17.02 $ 16.76 COMMON EQUITY TIER 1 CAPITAL (CET1)\nTotal shareholders' equity $ 1,571,701 $ 1,582,535 $ 1,561,918 $ 1,537,961 $ 1,520,208 AOCI-related adjustments (3) 48,248 27,825 28,509 43,005 45,798 CET1 adjustments and deductions: Goodwill net of associated deferred tax liabilities (DTLs) (366,461 ) (359,841 ) (360,198 ) (347,085 ) (347,442 ) Other adjustments and deductions for CET1 (2) (10,248 ) (11,359 ) (11,267 ) (10,803 ) (8,637 ) CET1 capital (e) 1,243,240 1,239,160 1,218,962 1,223,078 1,209,927 Additional tier 1 capital instruments plus related surplus 60,000 60,000 60,000 60,000 60,000 Less: additional tier 1 capital deductions (2 ) (471 ) (247 ) (159 ) (267 ) Additional tier 1 capital 59,998 59,529 59,753 59,841 59,733 Tier 1 capital $ 1,303,238 $ 1,298,689 $ 1,278,715 $ 1,282,919 $ 1,269,660 Common equity tier 1 capital ratio (e)/(c) 11.77 % 11.80 % 11.73 % 12.19 % 12.16 % (1) Calculation = ((net income adjusted for intangible amortization/number of days in period)*number of days in year)/total average tangible equity.\n(2) Includes other intangible assets, net of DTLs, disallowed deferred tax assets (DTAS), threshold deductions and transition adjustments, as applicable.\n(3) The December 31, 2017 amount contains a reclassification adjustment of $8.5 million from AOCI to retained earnings as allowed by regulatory agencies in an interagency statement released January 18, 2018 to address disproportionate tax effect in AOCI resulting from the recent enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 and the application of Financial Accounting Standards Board Accounting Standards Codification Topic 740, Income Taxes.\nTRUSTMARK CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIALS December 31, 2017 ($ in thousands except per share data) (unaudited) Note 9 – Non-GAAP Financial Measures (continued)\nTrustmark discloses certain non-GAAP financial measures, including net income adjusted for significant non-routine transactions, because Management uses these measures for business planning purposes, including to manage Trustmark’s business against internal projected results of operations and to measure Trustmark’s performance. Trustmark views net income adjusted for significant non-routine transactions as a measure of our core operating business, which excludes the impact of the items detailed below, as these items are generally not operational in nature. This non-GAAP measure also provides another basis for comparing period-to-period results as presented in the accompanying selected financial data table and the audited consolidated financial statements by excluding potential differences caused by non-operational and unusual or non-recurring items. Readers are cautioned that these adjustments are not permitted under GAAP.
