The firm also said that founder, chairman and chief executive officer Daniel Och and the firm’s board of directors hoped that the 34-year-old Levin, Och’s longtime protégé and heir apparent, would remain as co-CIO. David Windreich is the other co-CIO and is also a board member.\nThe Wall Street Journal reported last week that the board had wanted to move ahead with the succession plan to let Levin take over this year but that Och soured on Levin and refused to accept the plan. Och, through a spokesman, and Levin did not respond to requests last week for comment.\nBarr, a lawyer who had served as a U.S. Attorney General, joined Och-Ziff’s board in 2016. He sent a one paragraph note informing Och and others of his plans on January 23.\n“This is to advise you that I am resigning from the board of directors, effective at the end of this month (January). If that timing causes any difficulties for the company, please let me know.” The email was attached as an exhibit to the filing.\nHe serves as Chairman of Och-Ziff’s Corporate Responsibility and Compliance Committee and as a member of the Audit Committee and the Nominating Committee.\nOch-Ziff built itself into one of the hedge fund industry’s biggest firms by staying out of the limelight and delivering steady returns that delighted pension funds.\nBut it made headlines when a subsidiary admitted to bribing African officials and after paying $412 million to settle criminal and civil charges with the U.S. government. This prompted clients to pull out billions, shrinking assets from $50 billion at its peak before the financial crisis in 2005.\nReporting by Svea Herbst-Bayliss; Editing by Muralikumar Anantharaman\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-01-30T12:13:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-30T06:30:32.022+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
