The final results for 2017 provide some foundation, but must be doubled and doubled again by the end of the decade,” CBI’s Chief Executive Sean Kidney said in a statement. \n“The spotlight is now firmly on financial system actors, banks, insurers, corporates and institutional investors to achieve this vital 2020 climate investment target,” he said. \nThe most common use of proceeds from green bonds last year was on renewable energy but investment in low-carbon buildings and energy efficiency rose in 2017, the CBI said. \n“With a multitude of rail and urban metro deals, allocations to low-carbon transport almost doubled in volume. The trend to finance an increasingly diverse range of projects continues,” it said.
