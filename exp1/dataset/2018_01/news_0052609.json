REUTERS/Henry Romero/File Photo De la Madrid later said in a Twitter post that his comments reflected his personal views.\nPresident Enrique Pena Nieto has said the United States and Mexico should not pursue diverging policies on marijuana. In 2016, he proposed a bill to allow Mexicans to carry up to an ounce of marijuana, but the measure stalled in Congress.\nCarlos Mendoza, governor of Baja California Sur, told local media that if the idea were adopted, it should be implemented in various areas popular with tourists.\n“It seems foolish and illogical that we’re here fighting with a strategy that costs lives in Mexico and magically, crossing the border, marijuana becomes legal,” he said.\nCalifornia this month became the sixth U.S. state to legalize the drug despite a federal ban.\nDespite the trend toward legalization north of the border, cartels still make millions of dollars from smuggling marijuana into the United States. Mexico legalized marijuana use for medical and scientific needs in June.\nAdditional reporting by Lizbeth Diaz; Editing by Dave Graham and Cynthia Osterman\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-26T02:54:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-26T03:03:17.012+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
