The bill funds the government for 17 days, and it funds the popular CHIP children's insurance program for six years. It does not include a permanent fix for the Obama-era DACA program, which Senate Democrats had originally demanded. \n\"There are no winners here today, I want to make that clear,\" said House Speaker Paul Ryan , shortly after the conclusion of the vote. \"No winners, except perhaps the millions of families who depend on the Children's Health Insurance Program. Soon, the longest reauthorization in the program's history will become law. But this is not a moment to pat ourselves on the back. Not even close,\" he said. \nNegotiations over the bill took place almost entirely in the Senate, where on Friday night, Majority Leader Mitch McConnell had been unable to reach the 60 vote threshold required to keep the government open.Speaking shortly after the \nBut on Monday morning, the first official day of government employee furloughs, McConnell said he intends to bring DACA and other immigration issues up for debate before Feb. 8.

Following an initial Senate vote on Monday, the president issued a statement saying he was \"pleased that Democrats in Congress have come to their senses.\" \nTrump also pledged that, \"once the Government is funded, my administration will work toward solving the problem of very unfair illegal immigration. We will make a long-term deal on immigration if, and only if, it is good for our country.\" \nHow such a deal might be structured, so as to have a chance of passing the Republican controlled House, is fast becoming the thorniest question in Washington D.C.
