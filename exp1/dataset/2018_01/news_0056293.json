The other 77 foreigners arrested were freed after being educated about their unacceptable behavior. \nThey could face between one month and one year in prison if convicted. \nSourng Sophea said that the accused wanted to go home, and called on the authorities to expel them rather than keep them in prison. \n“They want to go back to their home countries, they don’t want to be here anymore,” he said. \nCanada’s Global Affairs Department said consular services had been provided to their detained citizens in Cambodia.
