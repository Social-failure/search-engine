But National Medical Care, which had jumped 5.7 percent on Tuesday after swinging to a fourth-quarter profit, added a further 2.5 percent.\nCement shares were strong in unusually heavy trade, with Jouf Cement up 4.8 percent and Tabuk Cement jumping 10 percent. The sector reported weak 2017 earnings because of a slumping construction industry, but some investors expect a stronger 2018 as the government boosts spending.\nThe Qatar index slid 1.5 percent on a wave of profit-taking across the board; falling stocks outnumbered gainers by 32 to four. Qatar First Bank, the most heavily traded stock, dropped 1.6 percent.
