There was no immediate word from Indian authorities.\n“Following talks I have held with my friend, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, the Indian government has informed us that it is putting the Spike deal back on track. This is very important and there will be many more deals,” said Netanyahu, who is on a five day visit to India.
