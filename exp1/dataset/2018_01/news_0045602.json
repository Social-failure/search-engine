Net interest income increased $7.1 million to $83.3 million, primarily due to loan growth and higher loan spreads. Non-interest income increased $0.6 million to $16.0 million primarily due to greater syndication fees and trust fees in the quarter as compared to prior year. Non-interest expense increased $5.2 million to $40.3 million, primarily due to investments in people and product enhancements.\nHSA Bank\nWebster's HSA Bank division offers a comprehensive consumer-directed healthcare solution that includes health savings accounts, health reimbursement arrangements, flexible spending accounts and commuter benefits.

Non-interest income increased $2.2 million to $19.0 million primarily due to growth in accounts over the past year. Non-interest expense increased $3.7 million to $28.9 million primarily due to costs associated with supporting the growth in total accounts and expanded distribution.\nCommunity Banking\nCommunity Banking serves consumer and business banking customers primarily throughout southern New England and into Westchester County, New York.

Net interest income increased $4.4 million to $97.3 million primarily due to growth in loan and deposit balances as well as improved interest rate spreads. Non-interest income was flat at $26.9 million primarily driven by increases in fees from investment services offset by lower revenue in mortgage banking activities.

Net interest margin was 3.33 percent compared to 3.11 percent. The yield on interest-earning assets increased by 29 basis points, and the cost of funds increased by 7 basis points.

A reconciliation of net income and other performance ratios, as adjusted, is included in the accompanying selected financial highlights table.\nWe believe that providing certain non-GAAP financial measures provides investors with information useful in understanding our financial performance, our performance trends and financial position. We utilize these measures for internal planning and forecasting purposes.

We believe that our presentation and discussion, together with the accompanying reconciliations, provides a complete understanding of factors and trends affecting our business and allows investors to view performance in a manner similar to management. These non-GAAP measures should not be considered a substitute for GAAP basis measures and results, and we strongly encourage investors to review our consolidated financial statements in their entirety and not to rely on any single financial measure. Because non-GAAP financial measures are not standardized, it may not be possible to compare these financial measures with other companies' non-GAAP financial measures having the same or similar names.\nMedia Contact\nInvestor Contact\nAlice Ferreira, 203-578-2610\nTerry Mangan, 203-578-2318\nacferreira@websterbank.com\ntmangan@websterbank.com\nWEBSTER FINANCIAL CORPORATION\nSelected

ratios that utilize tangible equity, a non-GAAP financial measure. Return on average tangible common shareholders' equity measures the Company's net income available to common shareholders, adjusted for the tax-affected amortization of intangible assets, as a percentage of average shareholders' equity less average preferred stock and average goodwill and intangible assets. The tangible equity ratio represents shareholders' equity less goodwill and intangible assets divided by total assets less goodwill and intangible assets. The tangible common equity ratio represents shareholders' equity less preferred stock and goodwill and intangible assets divided by total assets less goodwill and intangible assets. Tangible book value per common share represents shareholders' equity less preferred stock and goodwill and intangible assets divided by common shares outstanding at the end of the period.\nThe efficiency ratio, which measures the costs expended to generate a dollar of revenue, is calculated excluding foreclosed property expense, amortization of intangibles, gain or loss on securities, and other non-recurring items. Core deposits express total deposits less time deposits. Accordingly, these are also non-GAAP financial measures.\nThe Company believes the use of these non-GAAP financial measures provides additional clarity in assessing the results of the Company. Other companies may define or calculate supplemental financial data differently. See the tables below for reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures with financial measures defined by GAAP.\nAt or for the Three Months Ended\n(In thousands, except per share data)\nDecember 31,\n2017\nSeptember 30,\n2017\nJune 30,\n2017\nMarch 31,\n2017\nDecember 31,\n2016\nReturn on average tangible common shareholders' equity:\nNet income (GAAP)\n$\n69,893\n$\n64,496\n$\n61,579\n$\n59,471\n$\n57,660\nLess: Preferred stock dividends (GAAP)\n2,112\n2,024\n2,024\n2,024\n2,024\nAdd: Intangible assets amortization, tax-affected at 35% (GAAP)\n635\n651\n668\n686\n703\nIncome adjusted for preferred stock dividends and intangible assets amortization\n(non-GAAP)\n$\n68,416\n$\n63,123\n$\n60,223\n$\n58,133\n$\n56,339\nIncome adjusted for preferred stock dividends and intangible assets amortization,\nannualized basis (non-GAAP)\n$\n273,664\n$\n252,492\n$\n240,892\n$\n232,532\n$\n225,356\nAverage shareholders' equity (non-GAAP)\n$\n2,675,733\n$\n2,635,312\n$\n2,597,222\n$\n2,559,354\n$\n2,526,099\nLess: Average preferred stock (non-GAAP)\n131,707\n122,710\n122,710\n122,710\n122,710\nAverage goodwill and other intangible assets (non-GAAP)\n568,546\n569,538\n570,560\n571,611\n572,682\nAverage tangible common shareholders' equity (non-GAAP)\n$\n1,975,480\n$\n1,943,064\n$\n1,903,952\n$\n1,865,033\n$\n1,830,707\nReturn on average tangible common shareholders' equity (non-GAAP)\n13.85\n%\n12.99\n%\n12.65\n%\n12.47\n%\n12.31\n%\nEfficiency ratio:\nNon-interest expense (GAAP)\n$\n171,049\n$\n161,823\n$\n164,419\n$\n163,784\n$\n161,871\nLess: Foreclosed property activity (GAAP)\n(97)\n(72)\n(143)\n74\n(90)\nIntangible assets amortization (GAAP)\n977\n1,002\n1,028\n1,055\n1,082\nOther expenses (non-GAAP)\n6,106\n213\n1,587\n1,123\n1,243\nNon-interest expense (non-GAAP)\n$\n164,063\n$\n160,680\n$\n161,947\n$\n161,532\n$\n159,636\nNet interest income (GAAP)\n$\n204,932\n$\n200,904\n$\n197,787\n$\n192,664\n$\n185,259\nAdd: Tax-equivalent adjustment (non-GAAP)\n4,444\n4,340\n4,136\n4,033\n3,902\nNon-interest income (GAAP)\n66,039\n65,846\n64,551\n63,042\n70,617\nOther (non-GAAP)\n421\n431\n555\n391\n408\nLess: Gain on investment securities, net (GAAP)\n—\n—\n—\n—\n—\nOne-time gain on the sale of an asset (GAAP)\n—\n—\n—\n—\n7,331\nIncome (non-GAAP)\n$\n275,836\n$\n271,521\n$\n267,029\n$\n260,130\n$\n252,855\nEfficiency ratio (non-GAAP)\n59.48\n%\n59.18\n%\n60.65\n%\n62.10\n%\n63.13\n%\nTangible equity:\nShareholders' equity (GAAP)\n$\n2,701,958\n$\n2,638,787\n$\n2,605,126\n$\n2,560,358\n$\n2,527,012\nLess: Goodwill and other intangible assets (GAAP)\n567,984\n568,962\n569,964\n570,992\n572,047\nTangible shareholders' equity (non-GAAP)\n$\n2,133,974\n$\n2,069,825\n$\n2,035,162\n$\n1,989,366\n$\n1,954,965\nTotal assets (GAAP)\n$\n26,487,645\n$\n26,350,182\n$\n26,174,930\n$\n26,002,916\n$\n26,072,529\nLess: Goodwill and other intangible assets (GAAP)\n567,984\n568,962\n569,964\n570,992\n572,047\nTangible assets (non-GAAP)\n$\n25,919,661\n$\n25,781,220\n$\n25,604,966\n$\n25,431,924\n$\n25,500,482\nTangible equity (non-GAAP)\n8.23\n%\n8.03\n%\n7.95\n%\n7.82\n%\n7.67\n%\nTangible common equity:\nTangible shareholders' equity (non-GAAP)\n$\n2,133,974\n$\n2,069,825\n$\n2,035,162\n$\n1,989,366\n$\n1,954,965\nLess: Preferred stock (GAAP)\n145,056\n122,710\n122,710\n122,710\n122,710\nTangible common shareholders' equity (non-GAAP)\n$\n1,988,918\n$\n1,947,115\n$\n1,912,452\n$\n1,866,656\n$\n1,832,255\nTangible assets (non-GAAP)\n$\n25,919,661\n$\n25,781,220\n$\n25,604,966\n$\n25,431,924\n$\n25,500,482\nTangible common equity (non-GAAP)\n7.67\n%\n7.55\n%\n7.47\n%\n7.34\n%\n7.19\n%\nTangible book value per common share:\nTangible common shareholders' equity (non-GAAP)\n$\n1,988,918\n$\n1,947,115\n$\n1,912,452\n$\n1,866,656\n$\n1,832,255\nCommon shares outstanding\n92,101\n92,034\n92,195\n92,154\n91,868\nTangible book value per common share (non-GAAP)\n$\n21.59\n$\n21.16\n$\n20.74\n$\n20.26\n$\n19.94\nCore deposits:\nTotal deposits\n$\n20,993,729\n$\n20,855,235\n$\n20,458,097\n$\n20,241,657\n$\n19,303,857\nLess: Certificates of deposit\n2,187,756\n1,918,817\n1,795,871\n1,718,193\n1,724,906\nBrokered certificates of deposit\n280,652\n299,674\n299,670\n299,906\n299,902\nCore deposits (non-GAAP)\n$\n18,525,321\n$\n18,636,744\n$\n18,362,556\n$\n18,223,558\n$\n17,279,049\nView original content: http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/webster-reports-fourth-quarter-2017-earnings-300586580.html\nSOURCE Webster Financial Corporation", "external_links": ["http://www.websterbank.com/", "http://www.websteronline.com/", "http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/webster-reports-fourth-quarter-2017-earnings-300586580.html"], "published": "2018-01-23T15:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-23T18:40:05.001+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
