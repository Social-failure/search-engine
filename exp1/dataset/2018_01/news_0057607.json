REUTERS/Pedro Nunes \nA centre-right alliance of Forza Italia, the League and the smaller, far-right Brothers of Italy is seen winning most seats at the election but probably falling short of a majority. \n5-Star currently has around 28 percent of voters’ support, which would not give it nearly enough seats to govern alone. \nPresident Sergio Mattarella is the supreme arbiter of Italian politics and is likely to play a key role in brokering any coalition accord if the election produces a hung parliament. \nDi Maio has said that if Mattarella asks him to try to form a government, he will make a public appeal for other parties to back his party’s programme. \nThere has been much media speculation that, in this case, the anti-immigration Northern League might break its alliance with Berlusconi to hook up with 5-Star in a coalition likely to be viewed with suspicion by Italy’s EU partners. \nDi Maio was accompanied in London by Lorenzo Fioramonti, an economics professor at Pretoria University in South Africa, who will be a 5-Star candidate at the election. \nInvestors also asked Di Maio about 5-Star’s fiscal policies, and he assured them he would not take unilateral decisions to push up the budget deficit but planned to negotiate with the European Commission and Italy’s partners, the source said. \nThe closed-door meetings were organised by Policy Sonar, a small, Rome-based political risk consultancy, and involved investors and hedge funds which manage more than $2 trillion (£1.41 trillion). \nThe meetings, which ran from 7.30 a.m. until mid-afternoon, included one-on-one sessions with individual funds and a group meeting over a two-hour lunch, the source said. \n“I think he made the right noises and made the right moves, and at the end of the meetings several investors told him he should come more often,” the source said.
