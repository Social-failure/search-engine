Some 56 flights were canceled because of Mayon, the Philippines’ most active and most picturesque volcano.

Some 6,165 evacuees were staying elsewhere. \nThe number of displaced increased after the provincial government expanded the danger zone around the 2,462-metre (8,077-foot) volcano to a radius of 9 km from the Phivolcs-recommended 8 km no-go zone.
