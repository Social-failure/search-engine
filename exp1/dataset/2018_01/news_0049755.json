What we have here is nothing like that,” Wuppertal public prosecutor Wolf-Tilman Baumert said. \n“These are highly professional criminals who can expect punishment if they are convicted. The legal penalty is a minimum six months custodial sentence per crime totaling up to 10 years,” he added. \nReporting by Katie Stephens, Reuters TV; Editing by Gareth Jones\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-30T17:20:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-30T17:35:57.005+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
