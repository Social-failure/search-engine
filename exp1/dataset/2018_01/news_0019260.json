BUYBACK \nLukoil also said it would establish a share buyback program “as an incremental mechanism to distribute capital to shareholders” and planned to cancel around 10 percent out of a total 16 percent of the treasury shares it holds. \n“I think these changes will further support the growth of the company’s shareholder value,” Alekperov said. \nThe board has supported the management initiative to cancel the major part of Lukoil treasury shares and use the remainder in a new long-term incentive program for key employees. \nThe company would be cancelling the treasury shares it once planned to use for acquisitions during 2018, while the buy back program worth $2-3 billion would last for five years, Alekperov told reporters. \nThe stakes held by both Alekperov and his business partner Leonid Fedun would increase following the changes, with Alekperov’s holdings rising to 30 percent and Fedun’s to just over 10 percent, Alekperov said. \nLukoil shares rose by 5 percent to 3,880 roubles, giving the company a market capitalization of $55 billion, Thomson Reuters data showed.
