He has denied any wrongdoing. \nA Reuters special report that preceded the parliamentary probe detailed how the government’s wheat supply chain had been riddled with corruption that was costing the country hundreds of millions of dollars per year. \nLawmakers who formed a fact-finding commission to investigate the scandal said upwards of 2 million tonnes, or 40 percent of the locally procured crop in 2016 may have been missing. \nEgypt procured about 3.4 million tonnes of wheat in last year’s harvest, the first after new measures were implemented to prevent the previous year’s fraud.
