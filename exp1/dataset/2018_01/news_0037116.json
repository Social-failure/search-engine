But there is a moral line between the critical analysis of our history and desecrating it.”\nIannucci, the film’s director, said he had not lost hope the Russian authorities would perform a U-turn.\n“All the Russians we’ve shown the film to so far, including Russian journalists, have said how much they enjoyed and appreciated the film,” he said. “They say two things: it’s funny, but it’s true. I‘m still confident we can get it in cinemas.”\n‘BAD BLOOD’\nRussia holds a presidential election on March 18 which incumbent Vladimir Putin is expected to win easily. Putin, who has dominated Russian politics for the last 18 years, has put patriotism at the centre of his rule.\nStalin was repudiated by the Soviet Union after his death. He is recognised as responsible for the deaths of millions, from policies that included the forced collectivisation of farms that caused famine, and from a succession of purges that saw mass executions and imprisonment at an archipelago of camps.\nBut the Soviet leader during World War Two is still associated by many Russians with the country’s greatest achievements. Putin has called Stalin “a complex figure” and said attempts to demonise him were a ploy to attack Russia.\nSome of the people who attended the film’s private viewing told Reuters they were disgusted.\n“It’s a despicable film,” said Nadezhda Usmanova, head of the Russian Military Historical Society’s department of information. The group was involved in organising the pre-release screening.\n“It’s a bad film, it’s a boring film, and it’s vile, repugnant and insulting,” Usmanova told Reuters.\nElena Drapeko, deputy head of the culture committee in the State Duma, the lower house of Parliament, said she found “extremism” in the movie.\n“It’s an effort to breed bad blood into the social harmony that has been reached in Russian society”, said Drapeko, who earlier in her career was a popular Soviet and Russian actress.\nWriting by Polina Ivanova and Andrew Osborn; Editing by Peter Graff\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-23T17:06:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-23T17:27:49.021+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
