Critics argue it grants police and spies some of the most extensive snooping capabilities in the West. \nIn 2016, the Court of Justice of the European Union (ECJ) ruled that the mass retention of data was illegal and that violating people’s privacy could only be justified by the objective of fighting serious crime and access to data should be subject to prior review by a court or independent body. \nThe British court on Tuesday agreed that accessing retained data without proper oversight or if there was no serious crime was inconsistent with EU law. \nBritain’s Home Office (interior ministry) had no immediate comment on the court decision. \nHowever, in November, ministers announced there would be a consultation on new additional safeguards in light of the ECJ decision to ensure access to communications data was limited to investigations into serious crime. \nCampaigners argue the planned overhaul of the IPA does not go far enough. \n“Yet again a UK court has ruled the government’s extreme mass surveillance regime unlawful,” said Martha Spurrier, director of civil rights group Liberty. \n“The latest incarnation of the Snoopers’ Charter, the Investigatory Powers Act, must be changed.” Editing by Stephen Addison", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-30T14:57:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-30T15:23:13.008+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
