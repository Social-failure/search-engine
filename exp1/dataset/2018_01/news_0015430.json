Microsoft first started accepting bitcoin as a payment method in 2014. \nFortune contacted Microsoft for more information and will update this story if it responds. \nGet Data Sheet , Fortune’s technology newsletter. \nBitcoin has had a wild ride over the past 12 months, surging to record highs one day and then tumbling the next. In mid-December, the cryptocurrency almost hit $20,000 , but just a few days later it dropped over 22% to $15,262. On Wednesday, bitcoin was trading as high as $14,694, according to Coindesk. \nMicrosoft’s temporary pause on Bitcoin in its online stores follows a similar decision by video gaming service Steam. In December, Steam said it would stop accepting Bitcoin due to its “high fees and volatility.” However, Steam said it’s possible that it would accept Bitcoin at a later date. \nUpdate: 3:39 PM PST . Microsoft confirmed that it has indeed restored bitcoin to its online stores.
