He added that he knew South African people were impatient for change but that “we should not humiliate President Zuma.”\nZuma, who orchestrated the removal of former president Thabo Mbeki in 2008 after succeeding Mbeki as ANC leader, no longer holds a top ANC post.\nZuma’s presidency, tainted by corruption accusations which he denies, has tarnished the image of Africa’s oldest liberation movement and seen the economy slow to a near-standstill.\nMarkets have rallied since Ramaphosa’s election as ANC leader in December, as investors have warmed to his promises to root out corruption and kick-start economic growth.\nAny sign that Zuma could step down before his second presidential term ends in 2019 has tended to lift South African assets, including the rand currency.\nRamaphosa faces a difficult balancing act as he struggles to unite a party which has been beset by bitter infighting for the past year. A faction within the ANC opposed his bid for party leader and is more closely aligned with Zuma.\nReporting by Alexander Winning; Editing by Raissa Kasolowsky\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-14T13:48:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-14T14:00:31.005+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
