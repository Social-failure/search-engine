We are of course infinitely smaller in scale but nonetheless every bit helps and sends an important message. Collectively we are done with supporting fossil fuels.\"\nThe divestiture movement gained widespread notoriety when The Rockefeller Brothers Fund announced their divestiture in 2014. More recently, the worlds largest sovereign wealth fund, the Country of Norway, with approximately $1 trillion dollars under management, has followed up its divestiture from coal and is now proposing to cut all ties with all of its oil and gas holdings.\nAccording to Go Fossil Free ( www.gofossilfree.org ), maintained by 350.org , the current value of divestitures is roughly $6 trillion dollars worth of investment capital pledged by more than 800 institutions across the globe.\nAbout Noya Fields Family Funds:\nThe Noya Fields Family Group of Charitable Funds supports by way of direct grants and strategic partnerships a wide range of philanthropic endeavors with a focus on the environment, human civil liberties, education and the arts.\nContacts\nKen Fields\nNoya + Fields Family Fund\n188697@email4pr.com\n917-975-3345\nView original content: http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/noya-fields-family-charitable-funds-to-join-fossil-fuel-divestiture-movement-300582121.html\nSOURCE Noya Fields Family Funds", "external_links": ["http://www.gofossilfree.org/", "http://www.noyafieldsfamily.org/", "http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/noya-fields-family-charitable-funds-to-join-fossil-fuel-divestiture-movement-300582121.html"], "published": "2018-01-15T16:45:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-15T18:52:58.051+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
