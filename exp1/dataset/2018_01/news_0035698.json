The company also announced a new global restructuring initiative and established a multi-year savings target for its ongoing cost savings program.\nExecutive Summary\nFourth quarter 2017 net sales of $4.6 billion increased 1 percent compared to the year-ago period and full-year 2017 net sales of $18.3 billion rose slightly. Diluted net income per share for the fourth quarter was $1.75 in 2017 and $1.40 in 2016. Full-year diluted net income per share was $6.40 in 2017 and $5.99 in 2016. Fourth quarter adjusted earnings per share were $1.57 in 2017 and $1.45 in 2016. Adjusted earnings per share exclude certain items described later in this news release. Full-year adjusted earnings per share were $6.23 in 2017, up 3 percent compared to $6.03 in 2016. The company's previous guidance was for earnings at the low end of the $6.20 to $6.35 range. The company has established a cost savings target of more than $1.5 billion over the 2018 to 2021 time period from its ongoing FORCE (Focused On Reducing Costs Everywhere) program. In addition, the company announced a new 2018 Global Restructuring Program to reduce the company's structural cost base by streamlining and simplifying its manufacturing supply chain and overhead organization. The restructuring is expected to generate annual cost savings of $500 to $550 million by the end of 2021 and accelerate the company's return to delivering its long-term growth objectives over time. Net sales in 2018 are expected to increase 1 to 2 percent. Diluted net income per share for 2018 is anticipated to be $3.90 to $4.50, including charges related to the restructuring. Adjusted earnings per share in 2018 are expected to be $6.90 to $7.20, a year-on-year increase of approximately 11 to 16 percent. The company's Board of Directors has approved a 3.1 percent increase in the quarterly dividend for 2018, which is the 46 th consecutive annual increase in the dividend.\nChairman and Chief Executive Officer Thomas J. Falk said, \"In 2017, we delivered bottom-line growth in a challenging environment. We also achieved all-time record FORCE cost savings of $450 million and reduced discretionary spending to help offset inflationary cost headwinds. In addition, we returned $2.3 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases.\"\nFalk continued, \"Although we expect market conditions will remain challenging in the near-term, we plan to deliver better results in 2018 while we begin to implement our new restructuring. We expect organic sales to return to growth while improving our margins and delivering double-digit growth in adjusted earnings per share. In addition, we will increase investments in our brands, our growth initiatives and the capabilities we need for long-term success. We will also continue to allocate capital in shareholder-friendly ways.\"\nFalk concluded, \"We believe that, over time, our 2018 Global Restructuring Program will accelerate our return to delivering on our long-term growth objectives. This is the biggest restructuring we have undertaken since the introduction of our Global Business Plan in 2003, and it will make our company leaner, stronger and faster. The changes we are making will improve our underlying profitability, provide more flexibility to invest in growth opportunities and help us compete even more effectively. At the same time, we are expecting our ongoing FORCE program to continue to deliver significant results and are making that clear by establishing a multi-year commitment for this program. Combined, our restructuring and FORCE programs will generate more than $2 billion of total cost savings over the next four years, giving us substantial funds to drive profitable growth. Today's announcement is the latest example of Kimberly-Clark's proactive and strategic approach to improving our business so we can win in the marketplace and create long-term shareholder value.\"\nFourth Quarter 2017 Operating Results\nSales of $4.6 billion in the fourth quarter of 2017 were up 1 percent compared to the year-ago period. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates benefited sales by more than 1 percent. Organic sales fell about 1 percent, as lower net selling prices of 2 percent were partially offset by improved product mix of 1 percent and slightly higher volumes. In North America, organic sales were down 3 percent in consumer products and up 1 percent in K-C Professional. Outside North America, organic sales increased 4 percent in developing and emerging markets but fell 3 percent in developed markets.\nFourth quarter operating profit was $812 million in 2017 and $839 million in 2016. Fourth quarter adjusted operating profit was $836 million in 2017 and $859 million in 2016. The year-over-year comparison was impacted by lower net selling prices and $130 million of higher input costs, driven by increases in pulp and other raw materials. Results benefited from favorable volumes and product mix, $95 million of cost savings from the company's FORCE program and reduced marketing, research and general spending.\nThe fourth quarter effective tax rate was 19.2 percent in 2017 and 35.7 percent in 2016. The rate in 2017 included a net benefit as a result of U.S. tax reform and related activities. The fourth quarter adjusted effective tax rate was 29.7 percent in 2017 and 35.4 percent in 2016.\nKimberly-Clark's share of net income of equity companies in the fourth quarter was $25 million in 2017 and $29 million in 2016. At Kimberly-Clark de Mexico, results were impacted by higher input costs, partially offset by benefits from sales growth and cost savings.\nCash Flow and Balance Sheet\nCash provided by operations in the fourth quarter was $863 million in 2017 and $871 million in 2016. Full-year cash provided by operations was $2,929 million in 2017 compared to $3,232 million in 2016. The decline was in line with expectations and driven by higher tax payments. Capital spending for the fourth quarter was $190 million in 2017 and $189 million in 2016. Full-year spending was $785 million in 2017 and $771 million in 2016.\nFourth quarter 2017 share repurchases were 0.9 million shares at a cost of $100 million, bringing full-year repurchases to 7.2 million shares at a cost of $900 million. Total debt was $7.4 billion at the end of 2017 and $7.6 billion at the end of 2016.\nFORCE Cost Savings Target\nThe company has established a four-year cost savings target of more than $1.5 billion from its ongoing FORCE program over the 2018 to 2021 time period. The savings will further enhance the company's ability to invest in growth opportunities, offset headwinds and improve gross margin. The savings will be achieved through a continued focus on improving productivity at manufacturing facilities, optimizing raw material and product design costs, generating benefits from procurement activities and improving distribution efficiencies.\n2018 Global Restructuring Program - Overview\nThe 2018 Global Restructuring Program is expected to reduce Kimberly-Clark's structural cost base and enhance the company's flexibility to invest in its brands, growth initiatives and capabilities critical to delivering future growth. The program will make Kimberly-Clark's overhead organization structure and manufacturing supply chain less complex and more efficient. Over time, the program is expected to accelerate the company's return to delivering sales and earnings growth in line with its Global Business Plan objectives and further enhance long-term shareholder value.\nThe company expects the program will generate annual pre-tax cost savings of $500 to $550 million by the end of 2021. Savings will be driven by workforce reductions, which are anticipated to be in a range of 5,000 to 5,500 (12 to 13 percent of current headcount), along with manufacturing supply chain efficiencies. The program is expected to broadly impact all of the company's business segments and organizations in each major geography. The savings are incremental to the company's ongoing FORCE cost savings program.\nThe company expects to close or sell approximately 10 manufacturing facilities and expand production capacity at several others to improve overall scale and cost. As part of the program, Kimberly-Clark expects to exit or divest some low-margin businesses that generate approximately 1 percent of company net sales. The sales are concentrated in the consumer tissue business segment.\nTo implement the restructuring program, the company expects total cash spending of $1,500 to $1,700 million by the end of 2020, consisting of $900 to $1,000 million in pre-tax cash restructuring charges and approximately $600 to $700 million in incremental capital spending.\nThe company also expects to incur non-cash restructuring charges of $800 to $900 million pre-tax by the end of 2020, making the total expected restructuring charges $1,700 to $1,900 million pre-tax ($1,350 to $1,500 million after-tax). Restructuring charges in 2018 are anticipated to be $1,200 to $1,350 million pre-tax ($950 to $1,050 million after tax). The company will exclude the restructuring charges when it reports adjusted results in future periods.\nFourth Quarter 2017 Business Segment Results\nPersonal Care Segment\nFourth quarter sales of $2.3 billion were up 1 percent.

Mentioned elsewhere in this release. U.S. tax reform. In the fourth quarter of 2017, the company recognized a net benefit as a result of U.S. tax reform and related activities. 2014 Organization Restructuring. In October 2014, the company initiated a restructuring program in order to improve organization efficiency and offset the impact of stranded overhead costs resulting from the spin-off of the company's health care business.

In the second quarter of 2016, the company recorded a modest amount of income related to an updated assessment of the impact of deconsolidating the company's Venezuelan business at the end of 2015.\nThe company provides these non-GAAP financial measures as supplemental information to our GAAP financial measures. Management and the company's Board of Directors use adjusted earnings, adjusted earnings per share and adjusted gross and operating profit to (a) evaluate the company's historical and prospective financial performance and its performance relative to its competitors, (b) allocate resources and (c) measure the operational performance of the company's business units and their managers. Management also believes that the use of an adjusted effective tax rate provides improved insight into the tax effects of our ongoing business operations.\nAdditionally, the Management Development and Compensation Committee of the company's Board of Directors has used certain of the non-GAAP financial measures when setting and assessing achievement of incentive compensation goals. These goals are based, in part, on the company's adjusted earnings per share and improvement in the company's adjusted return on invested capital and adjusted operating profit return on sales determined by excluding certain of the adjustments that are used in calculating these non-GAAP financial measures.\nThis news release includes information regarding organic sales growth, which describes the impact of changes in volume, net selling prices and product mix on net sales.
