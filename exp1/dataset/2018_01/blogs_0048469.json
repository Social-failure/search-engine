Tweet \n(If you ask Home who Jesus Christ or Satan is now, it will respond, \"Religion can be complicated and I'm still learning.\") \nWhat's going on here? The problem lies with Google's so-called \"featured snippets.\" Whether or not you have a smart speaker, you've likely seen this product in action: Ask a question and Google will often serve up a box at the top of search highlighting what its algorithms have determined to be the best answer. \nThis answer isn't always right, however. \nFeatured snippets have turned up a host of highly publicized errors over the years , but the problem is much more pernicious when an objectionable answer comes via voice, where it's harder to understand the source that Google's pulling from.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-27T02:42:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-27T02:52:12.022+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
