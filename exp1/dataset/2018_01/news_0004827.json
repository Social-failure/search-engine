Venezuela is reeling from an economic crisis, with millions struggling with food and medicine shortages.\n“President Maduro and his inner circle continue to put their own interests above those of the Venezuelan people,” U.S Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin said in a statement.\n“This action underscores the United States’ resolve to hold Maduro and others engaged in corruption in Venezuela accountable.”\nMaduro regularly laughs off Washington’s disapproval and blames the U.S. “empire” for Venezuela’s economic woes.\nReporting by David Alexander and Lesley Wroughton; Editing by Tim Ahmann and Lisa Von Ahn\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-05T17:25:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-05T17:35:59.020+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
