After that, still we can analyse where we are,” the Spaniard added. \n“But I don’t think that will change too much because I have a responsibility to the fans, to the players, to the club. I understand. I have been here for a while and I understand the feelings of everyone.” Writing by Simon Jennings in Bengaluru; Editing by Peter Rutherford", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-31T09:36:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-31T10:00:23.005+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
