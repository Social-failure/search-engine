If the deal had fallen through, Airbus would have had “no choice” but to close production, he had said. \n“This new order underscores Airbus’ commitment to produce the A380 at least for another ten years. I‘m personally convinced more orders will follow Emirates’ example and that this great aircraft will be built well into the 2030s,” Leahy said in a statement on Thursday.
