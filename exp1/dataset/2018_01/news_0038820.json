Therefore, they should not be considered a substitute for income or cash flow data prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies. The Company defines free cash flow as net cash provided by operating activities less purchases of property, plant and equipment. It should not be inferred that the entire free cash flow amount is available for discretionary expenditures. The Company defines free cash flow conversion as free cash flow divided by net income attributable to 3M. The Company believes free cash flow and free cash flow conversion are meaningful to investors as they function as useful measures of performance and the Company uses these measures as an indication of the strength of the company and its ability to generate cash.

The Company defines net debt as total debt less the total of cash, cash equivalents and current and long-term marketable securities. 3M believes net debt is meaningful to investors as 3M considers net debt and its components to be an important indicator of liquidity and a guiding measure of capital structure strategy. 3M Company and Subsidiaries\nSUPPLEMENTAL FINANCIAL INFORMATION\nNON-GAAP MEASURES – (CONTINUED)\n(Dollars in millions)\n(Unaudited)\nTwelve months ended December 31, Return on Invested Capital (non-GAAP measure) 2017 2016 Net income including non-controlling interest $ 4,869 $ 5,058 Interest expense (after-tax) (1) 208 143 Adjusted net income (Return) $ 5,077 $ 5,201 Average shareholders' equity (including non-controlling interest) (2) $ 11,627 $ 11,316 Average short-term and long-term debt (3) 12,156 11,725 Average invested capital $ 23,783 $ 23,041 Return on invested capital (non-GAAP measure) (c) 21.3 % 22.6 % (1) Effective income tax rate used for interest expense 35.5 % 28.3 % (2) Calculation of average equity (includes non-controlling interest) Ending total equity as of: March 31 $ 11,040 $ 11,495 June 30 11,644 11,658 September 30 12,202 11,769 December 31 11,622 10,343 Average total equity $ 11,627 $ 11,316 (3) Calculation of average debt Ending short-term and long-term debt as of: March 31 $ 11,711 $ 11,139 June 30 11,301 11,749 September 30 11,663 12,361 December 31 13,949 11,650 Average short-term and long-term debt $ 12,156 $ 11,725 (c) Return on Invested Capital (ROIC) is not defined under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.

The Company defines ROIC as adjusted net income (net income including non-controlling interest plus after-tax interest expense) divided by average invested capital (equity plus debt). The Company believes ROIC is meaningful to investors as it focuses on shareholder value creation. 3M Company and Subsidiaries\nSUPPLEMENTAL FINANCIAL INFORMATION NON-GAAP MEASURES – (CONTINUED) (Dollars in millions, except per share amounts)\n(Unaudited)\nThree months ended December 31, 2017 Q4 2016 Q4 2017\nReported Adjusted\nAdjusted income, earnings per share, & effective tax rate\nReported GAAP\nGAAP Adjustment Non-GAAP\n(non-GAAP measures)\nMeasure Measure for TCJA Measure (d)\nOperating income $ 1,665 $ 1,821 $ — $ 1,821 Income before taxes $ 1,610 $ 1,672 $ — $ 1,672 Provision for income taxes $ 454 $ 1,147 $ (762 ) $ 385 Effective tax rate 28.2 % 68.6 % 23.0 % Net income attributable to 3M $ 1,155 $ 523 $ 762 $ 1,285 Earnings per diluted share $ 1.88 $ 0.85 $ 1.25 $ 2.10 Earnings per diluted share percent change (54.8 ) % 11.7 % Year ended December 31, 2017 Year End 2016 Year End 2017\nReported Adjusted\nAdjusted income, earnings per share, & effective tax rate\nReported GAAP\nGAAP Adjustment Non-GAAP\n(non-GAAP measures)\nMeasure Measure for TCJA Measure (d)\nOperating income $ 7,223 $ 7,820 $ — $ 7,820 Income before taxes $ 7,053 $ 7,548 $ — $ 7,548 Provision for income taxes $ 1,995 $ 2,679 $ (762 ) $ 1,917 Effective tax rate 28.3 % 35.5 % 25.4 % Net income attributable to 3M $ 5,050 $ 4,858 $ 762 $ 5,620 Earnings per diluted share $ 8.16 $ 7.93 $ 1.24 $ 9.17 Earnings per diluted share percent change\n(2.8 ) % 12.4 % (d) During the fourth quarter of 2017, 3M recorded a net tax expense of $762 million related to the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA). The expense is primarily related to the TCJA’s transition tax on previously unremitted earnings of non-U.S. subsidiaries and is net of remeasurement of 3M’s deferred tax assets and liabilities considering the TCJA’s newly enacted tax rates and certain other impacts. This provisional amount is subject to adjustment during the measurement period of up to one year following the December 2017 enactment of the TCJA, as provided by recent SEC guidance. In addition to reporting financial results in accordance with U.S. GAAP, the Company also provides non-GAAP measures that adjust for the net impact of enactment of the TCJA. This item represents a significant charge that impacted the Company’s financial results. Income, earnings per share, and the effective tax rate are all measures for which 3M provides the reported GAAP measure and an adjusted measure.

Integrated the former Renewable Energy Division into existing divisions;\n2. Combined two divisions to form the Automotive and Aerospace Solutions Division; and\n3. Consolidated U.S. customer account activity - impacting dual credit reporting\nIntegration of former Renewable Energy Division\nThe (i) solar and wind and (ii) energy product lines (along with certain technology previously included in Corporate and Unallocated) of the former Renewable Energy Division (RED) were integrated into the existing Electrical Markets Division and Electronics Materials Solutions Division, respectively, within the Electronics and Energy business segment. In addition, the former RED’s window film products were moved into the Commercial Solutions Division within the Safety and Graphics business segment. This change resulted in a decrease in previously reported net sales and operating income for total year 2016 of $203 million and $38 million, respectively, in the Electronics and Energy segment. These decreases were offset by a $207 million and $29 million increase in previously reported total year 2016 net sales and operating income, respectively, in the Safety and Graphics business segment, and a $4 million decrease and $9 million increase in previously reported net sales and operating income, respectively, in Corporate and Unallocated.\nCreation of Automotive and Aerospace Solutions Division\nThe former Automotive Division and Aerospace and Commercial Transportation Division (both within the Industrial business segment) were combined to create the Automotive and Aerospace Solutions Division. Because this realignment was within the Industrial business segment, it had no impact on business segment reporting.\nConsolidation of U.S. customer account activity - impacting dual credit reporting\nThe Company consolidated its customer account activity in the U.S. into more centralized sales districts to better serve customers. As discussed further below, 3M business segment reporting measures include dual credit to business segments for certain U.S. sales and related operating income. This dual credit is based on which business segment provides customer account activity (“sales district”) with respect to a particular product sold in the U.S. Previously, a customer in the U.S. may have been aligned to several sales districts associated with multiple divisions or segments based on the individual products the customer purchased across 3M’s portfolio. The alignment of U.S. customer accounts to fewer, more focused sales districts therefore changed the attribution of dual credit across 3M’s business segments. As a result, previously reported aggregate business segment net sales and operating income for total year 2016 increased $163 million and $36 million, respectively, offset by similar increases in the elimination of dual credit net sales and operating income amounts.\nThe financial information presented herein reflects the impact of the preceding business segment reporting changes for all periods presented. Refer to 3M’s Current Report on Form 8-K furnished on March 9, 2017, for additional supplemental unaudited historical business segment net sales and operating income information. In addition, these business segment changes were reflected in 3M’s Current Report on Form 8-K dated May 4, 2017, (which updated 3M’s 2016 Annual Report on Form 10-K) and 3M’s Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q for the periods ended March 31, 2017, June 30, 2017, and Sept. 30, 2017.\nBUSINESS SEGMENT INFORMATION Three months ended Year ended NET SALES December 31, December 31, (Millions) 2017 2016 2017 2016 Industrial $ 2,718 $ 2,543 $ 10,911 $ 10,399 Safety and Graphics 1,545 1,343 6,148 5,881 Health Care 1,474 1,390 5,813 5,566 Electronics and Energy 1,321 1,175 5,159 4,643 Consumer 1,174 1,094 4,589 4,484 Corporate and Unallocated (4 ) 2 1 7 Elimination of Dual Credit (238 ) (218 ) (964 ) (871 ) Total Company $ 7,990 $ 7,329 $ 31,657 $ 30,109 BUSINESS SEGMENT INFORMATION Three months ended Year ended OPERATING INCOME December 31, December 31, (Millions) 2017 2016 2017 2016 Industrial $ 527 $ 558 $ 2,289 $ 2,395 Safety and Graphics 406 271 2,067 1,423 Health Care 464 413 1,781 1,763 Electronics and Energy 334 325 1,254 1,041 Consumer 269 229 993 1,065 Corporate and Unallocated (127 ) (83 ) (352 ) (272 ) Elimination of Dual Credit (52 ) (48 ) (212 ) (192 ) Total Company $ 1,821 $ 1,665 $ 7,820 $ 7,223 About 3M\nAt 3M, we apply science in collaborative ways to improve lives daily.
