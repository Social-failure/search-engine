She also serves as a committee chair in program development for the Unified Wine and Grape Symposium and is a member of the UWGS Managing LLC.\n“The technology that VinSense offers has a broad application that promotes quality and sustainability,” Asimont said. “Joining their team will give me the chance to bring this new technology to vineyards in California, Oregon and Washington.”\nAsimont’s career began in vineyard management for Cambria Winery and Vineyard. She later joined Geyser Peak Winery as their grower relations representative, and later joined the Francis Ford Coppola Winery team as their director of grower relations. She built a team that worked throughout the state of California and sought certified sustainability status for their estate vineyards.\nShe said she hopes to promote increased sustainability and efficiency for perennial farmers.\n“Our technology promotes sustainability and efficiency by making big data available and usable by perennial crop farmers,” Asimont said. “We can address two major industry issues: labor shortages and resource management. VinSense technology allows growers to make immediate and beneficial effects on their crops, increasing quality and sustainability.”\nAsimont also serves as adjunct faculty at Santa Rosa Junior College’s viticulture department that fits with her position at VinSense. Her philosophies supporting continuing education and advancing technologies can assist with VinSense’s expansion and with classroom learning.\n“Sustainability is everything for the future of wine grape production,” she said. “We can achieve that longevity through technological advancements and a desire to never stop learning. I believe that as long as I’m never too comfortable, I am still learning and bettering myself.”\nVinSense licensed its technology through the Purdue Research Foundation’s Office of Technology Commercialization .
