Slideshow (6 Images) \nThey then had to endure Gladbach pressure for much of the second half but hung on for the win. \nThe visitors could have equalised when Boateng brought down Lars Stindl in the box but instead Thorgan Hazard thundered his 78th minute penalty onto the crossbar, his first miss this season after converting his previous four spot kicks. \nJovic then struck late to make sure of the three points. \nBayern Munich, top on 47 points, host Hoffenheim on Saturday.
