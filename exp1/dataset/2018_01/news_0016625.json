The group, a component of the NCRI, has since renounced violence.\n“There is an urgent danger of flight in this case,” Dabiran said.\nNo comment was immediately available from the Iranian embassy in Berlin.\nReporting by Andrea Shalal, Editing by William Maclean\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-01-11T03:02:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-11T12:27:17.014+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
