The war has sent nearly two million refugees flooding across the region in Africa’s worst such crisis since the 1994 Rwanda genocide.\nMahamat did not specify whether the AU was referring to travel bans, asset freezes or arms embargos - all options that have been discussed.\n“All the agreements that have been signed have been violated,” he said. “Here (at the AU), we have provisions on sanctions.”\nSome top officials close to Kiir have already been sanctioned by the United States, including the once-powerful army chief Paul Malong, who was later fired and forced into exile when he quarreled with the president.\nThe United States wants to impose an arms embargo, but may face resistance at the U.N. from China, who has invested heavily in South Sudan’s oil fields.\nReporting by Aaron Maasho; Editing by Matthew Mpoke Bigg\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-29T21:55:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-30T02:30:42.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
