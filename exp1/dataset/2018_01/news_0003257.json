Met Eireann said a combination of high tides and exceptionally high seas would result in coastal damage and further flooding.\nThree people died in October when Tropical Storm Ophelia battered every corner of Ireland, bringing down trees and power lines and whipping up 10-meter (30-foot) waves.\nWriting by Padraic Halpin in Dublin; editing by Stephen Addison\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-03T12:34:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-03T12:53:10.041+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
