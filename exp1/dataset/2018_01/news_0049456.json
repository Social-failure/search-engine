Even so, that still represents \"the most favorable balance in the history of the industry,\" said David Israelite, president of the music publishers association.\nNone of the major companies affected by the new music streaming royalties responded to requests by The Associated Press for comment, leaving it unclear whether the shift will prod any of them to raise the prices paid by consumers.\nThe popularity of music streaming services has soared in the past few years as more consumers have embraced paying a monthly or annual subscription fee for unlimited access to tens of millions of songs instead of incrementally buying a more limited amount of music on CDs or in a digital download.\nThose changing habits have pushed artists, songwriters and publishers to step up their efforts to get a larger cut of the royalties generated from music streaming — a format that didn't even exist when some performers signed their last record deals years ago.\nThe Copyright Royalty Board drew up the new rates for songwriters and publishers after hearing evidence during a trial last year.\n\"Songwriters desperately need and deserve the rate increases,\" said Bart Herbison, executive director for the Nashville Songwriters Association International, another trade group.\nThe new royalties seem unlikely to faze Apple, Google and Amazon — all of whom rank among the world's richest companies and operate their music streaming services as complements to other products that generate most of their revenue.\nThe new royalty systems could leave a bigger financial dent in smaller and less diversified companies such as Spotify and Pandora, even though both are music streaming pioneers.\nThis story has been corrected to refer to the \"Copyright Royalty Board\" instead of the \"Copyright Ruling Board.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-29T01:51:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-29T03:47:26.001+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
