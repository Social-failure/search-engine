The bank paused with raising rates then after lifting borrowing costs twice since August, and analysts expect the next move in February.\n“I was one of two who thinks inflation risks are slightly higher,” Benda said in the interview. “This basically justifies, or would give us the possibility to raise interest rates at a slightly faster tempo than the trajectory we have in the forecast.” (Reporting by Jason Hovet)\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-01-16T19:10:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-17T20:10:59.014+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
