We’ve rolled them out and I think you can expect there will be more sanctions coming.” Reporting by Steve Holland, Katanga Johnson, Jeff Mason and Arshad Mohammed in Washington; Additional reporting by John Irish in Paris; Writing by Doina Chiacu and Arshad Mohammed; Editing by Lisa Shumaker and Tom Brown", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-01-12T03:44:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-11T21:52:59.022+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
