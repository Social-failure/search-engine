For instance, unlike any other platform — even Google and Facebook — Amazon combines global audience scale and engagement with actual conversion and transactional data,\" he wrote. \"Any new meaningful competitor could take share from an already concentrated market — especially as advertisers and agencies are increasingly interested in diversifying their spend beyond the two goliaths.\"\nMay predicts Amazon's ad business sales will grow to $50.6 billion by 2028 from $10.2 billion this year.\nAmazon shares are up 68 percent in the previous 12 months through Friday versus the S&P 500's 25 percent gain.\nThe company's shares are up 0.4 percent in Monday's premarket session after the report. Amazon will report its fourth-quarter earnings results on Thursday. \n\nDisclaimer", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-29T14:46:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-29T14:47:38.010+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
