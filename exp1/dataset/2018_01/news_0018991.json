Commissioning of the first plant, which will have two reactors with a total a capacity between 2 and 3.2 GW, is expected in 2027.\nSaudi Arabia’s energy minister, Khalid al-Falih, said last month that he expected to sign contracts to build two nuclear reactors by the end of 2018.\nSaudi Arabia has sent a request for information to international suppliers to build two reactors, the first step towards a formal tendering competition.\nSabery said Riyadh was currently evaluating requirements from five countries; China, Russia, South Korea, France and the United States.\nRussian and South Korean companies have said they plan to bid and sources have told Reuters that Toshiba-owned U.S. company Westinghouse is in talks with U.S. rivals to form a bidding consortium. French state-controlled utility EDF also intends to take part in the tender.\nSaudi Arabia is interested in reaching a civilian nuclear cooperation agreement with Washington, and Riyadh has invited U.S. firms to take part in developing the kingdom’s first atomic energy program.\nReporting by Stanley Carvalho; Writing by Reem Shamseddine; Editing by Rania El Gamal and Louise Heavens\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-15T12:39:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-15T12:58:48.006+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
