Overall production growth is still led by the IT sector,” Park Sang-hyun, chief economist, HI Investment & Securities.\nCar production dropped 11.4 percent from a month earlier while output of machine tools fell 4 percent.\nPark added the Bank of Korea will not be able to raise its policy interest rate in the first quarter given the uneven growth path, but “may be able to make a move in the second quarter should exports and the global economy hold up”.\nThe BOK held its policy interest rate KROCRT=ECI steady in January after raising it for the first time in more than six years to 1.50 percent in November. The bank flagged concerns over economic uncertainties and soft inflation, which remain hurdles to policy tightening this year.\nThursday’s data showed production of memory chips expanded 2.9 percent from a month earlier and the output of communications equipment surged 27.3 percent.\nIn annual terms, car production contracted by 25.2 percent, while output of electronic equipment grew 19.3 percent, the statement showed.\nDecember service sector output gained 0.2 percent from previous month after growing 2.5 percent in November.\nReporting by Cynthia Kim; Editing by Eric Meijer\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-01-31T08:20:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-31T16:14:05.029+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
