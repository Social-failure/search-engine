Dividend decreases surged to $7.9 billion, up from $2.3 billion for Q4 2016.\nFor full-year 2017, net dividend increases rose 56.9% to $37.1 billion, compared to a $23.6 billion increase for full-year 2016 .

It was the eighth consecutive year of higher payments and the sixth consecutive year of record payments.\"\nAdditional findings from S&P Dow Jones Indices' quarterly analysis of the dividend activity of U.S. traded issues include:\nDividend Increases (defined as an increase in dividend payments):\n801 dividend increases were reported for Q4 2017, compared to 784 increases for Q4 2016, a 2.2% year-over-year increase.

For 2017, 445 issues decreased their dividend payments, compared to 659 decreases during 2016, a 32.5% decrease.\nNon-S&P 500® domestic common issues paying a dividend:\nThe percentage of non-S&P 500 domestic common issues paying a dividend declined to 55.2%, down from 55.3% for Q3 2017 and up from 54.7% for Q4 2016. The weighted dividend yield for paying issues was 2.36%, down from 2.48% for Q3 2017 and 2.59% for Q4 2016.\nLarge-, Mid-, and Small-Cap Dividends:\n417 issues, or 82.6%, within the S&P 500® currently pay a dividend, unchanged from Q3 2017. All 30 members of the Dow Jones Industrial Average® pay a dividend.\nSilverblatt found that 70.0% of S&P MidCap 400® issues pay a cash dividend, up from 69.3% for Q3 2017; 51.1% of S&P SmallCap 600® issues pay a dividend, down from 51.6% for Q3 2017.\nYields continued to vary, with large-caps at 1.87% (1.97% for Q3 2017), mid-caps at 1.49% (1.54% for Q3 2017) and small-caps at 1.23% (flat from Q3 2017).\nThe yields across dividend-paying market-size classifications remain competitive, with large-caps at 2.24% (2.37% for Q3 2017), mid-caps at 2.06% (2.15% for Q3 2017) and small-caps at 2.25% (2.12% for Q2 2017).\n2017\nSilverblatt calculated that within the S&P 500, the average dividend increase during Q4 2017 was 10.4%, down from 14.4% during Q3 2017 and 11.7% during Q4 2016. The median increase was 8.2%, down from 9.8% during Q3 2017 and 9.1% during Q4 2016.\nFor all of 2017, Silverblatt notes that the median increase rose to 8.7%, up from 8.2% for 2016; the rise breaks a five-year trend of declining increases.\n2018\n\"Using the current declared dividend rates for the S&P 500, 2018 has a 2.3% increase of dividend payments before any announced increases,\" said Silverblatt. \"328 issues increased their dividends 356 times for 2017 and conditions are favorable for 2018 to be a record year for dividends.\"\nFor more information about S&P Dow Jones Indices, please visit www.spdji.com .\nABOUT S&P DOW JONES INDICES\nS&P Dow Jones Indices is the largest global resource for essential index-based concepts, data and research, and home to iconic financial market indicators, such as the S&P 500 ® and the Dow Jones Industrial Average ® .
