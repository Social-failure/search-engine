But Deutsche Bank have a slightly different assessment, calling concerns over the iPhone X \"just a speedbump\". \"Despite these cuts to our H1-18 view, H2-18 consensus estimates for ams AG still look low considering that Apple looks committed to roll out three new models with FaceID in 2018, while a new iPad looks likely,\" Deutsche Bank analysts say in a note. They add that they still see 1.6 billion euros of revenue in 2018, and that recent weakness in AMS' share price \"offers up a strong entry point to a stock with 30% upside.\" DB is sticking with its \"buy\" rating on the stock. (Kit Rees) EUROPEAN OPEN: TECH AND UTILITIES HIT STOXX 600 (0832 GMT) European shares are trading slightly in the red in early trading with utilities leading fallers after a profit warning from Suez, itself down 15 percent.

Among single stocks, Maersk was the second biggest gainer on the STOXX after Novartis.

Will Novartis figures help the sector catch up today?
