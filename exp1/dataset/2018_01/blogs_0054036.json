Recent purchases include CT scanner and ultrasound equipment maker Toshiba Medical Systems and Swedish video surveillance firm AXIS.\nCanon, which has a market value of some $52 billion, is also benefiting from robust demand for organic light emitting diode (OLED) screens in smartphones, with its OLED panel-making equipment unit flooded with new orders.\nAdditionally, strong demand for memory chips used in data centers and smartphones is expected to boost sales of its semiconductor lithography equipment.\nExpectations of a profit jump come despite Canon assuming a stronger yen for this year. It expects the Japanese currency to average 110 against the U.S. dollar, a rise of around 2 yen.\n($1 = 108.7200 yen)\nReporting by Makiko Yamazaki; Editing by Edwina Gibbs\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-30T08:15:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-30T08:33:04.002+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
