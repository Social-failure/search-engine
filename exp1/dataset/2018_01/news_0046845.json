No one was immediately available for comment at Matsumoto’s office or at the Cabinet Office. \nIn the Feb. 4 election in the city of Nago, incumbent Susumu Inamine, a staunch opponent of a plan to move the U.S. Marines’ Futenma airbase, located in another part of the island, to his city, is set to fight a candidate supported by Abe’s Liberal Democratic Party. \nAbe’s government and Okinawa authorities have been at loggerheads for years over the relocation plan as resentment has simmered among residents who say they bear an unfair burden in supporting the U.S. military presence in Japan. \nMany Okinawa residents associate the U.S. military presence with crime, pollution and accidents. A window fell from a U.S. helicopter onto a school sports field on the island last month, fanning safety concerns. \nThis is not the first time Abe has seen his minister resigning over missteps. \nLast July, Tomomi Inada stepped down as defense minister after a series of gaffes and a cover-up at her ministry that contributed to a plunge in public support for the prime minister. But his support bounced back after a cabinet reshuffle in August.
