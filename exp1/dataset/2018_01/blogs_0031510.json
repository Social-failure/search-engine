( bit.ly/2B8eowE ) \nThe results are based on a 28-factor algorithm that measures performance across eight benchmarks: financial, management and investor confidence, risk and resilience, legal compliance, innovation, people and social responsibility, environmental impact, and reputation. \nThe assessment tracks patent activity for technological innovation and sentiment in news and selected social media as the reflection of a company’s public reputation. \nThe set of tech companies is restricted to those that have at least $1 billion in annual revenue. \nAccording to the list, 45 percent of these 100 tech companies are headquartered in the United States. Japan and Taiwan are tied for second place with 13 companies each, followed by India with five tech leaders on the list. \nBy continent, North America leads with 47, followed by Asia with 38, Europe with 14 and Australia with one. \nThe strength of Asia highlights the growth of companies such as Tencent Holdings Ltd ( 0700.HK ), which became the first Asian firm to enter the club of companies worth more than $500 billion, and surpassed Facebook in market value in November. \nReuters is the news and media division of Thomson Reuters, which produced the list.
