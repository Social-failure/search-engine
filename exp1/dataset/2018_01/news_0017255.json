Trump, despite his repeated efforts, has failed to undermine the accord ... The deal is a long-lasting victory for Iran,” President Hassan Rouhani said in a speech, broadcast live on state TV.\nOn Friday, Trump agreed to waive sanctions against Iran for the last time to give the United States and European allies a final chance to amend the pact.\nIran says the nuclear deal is not renegotiable and it will stick to the accord as long as the other signatories respect it but will “shred” the deal if Washington pulls out.\nUnder the deal, Iran agreed to curb its nuclear programme, in exchange for lifting of most sanctions.\nAdditional reporting by Dubai newsroom,; Writing by Parisa Hafezi; Editing by Simon Cameron-Moore and Raissa Kasolowsky\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-01-14T15:05:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-14T21:00:22.002+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
