Do you know anybody? \n”No-one understands that, so I have to rely on my own feels and play around with what my body can and cannot do. \n“I don’t have the mobility that I used to and that’s just the reality.” \nWoods is now generating a clubhead speed of around 125 mph with his driver, comparable to the best on tour, and almost as fast as the 126-128 mph when he was at his prime. \n“My surgeon said once (the back is) fused, you’ll have speed like you did back in your early 30s,” said Woods. \n”And he’s right, because there’s no pain. I‘m not flinching. It doesn’t hurt to take the club back, doesn’t hurt right before impact, doesn’t hurt after impact, doesn’t hurt when I walk. \n”I can let it go, I can hit it and I‘m getting the ball out there a little bit. \n“Now I’ve got to start doing it in a tournament. It’s going to take a little time but I‘m looking forward to it.” (Editing by Greg Stutchbury)", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-25T01:37:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-25T02:21:41.011+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
