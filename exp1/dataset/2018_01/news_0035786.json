He did not respond to additional questions by text about his career or other episodes in which he was accused of wrongdoing.\nFILE PHOTO: Venezuela's Interior and Justice Minister Nestor Reverol attends a news conference in Caracas, Venezuela April 6, 2017. REUTERS/Marco Bello/File Photo While the EU already has an arms embargo in place on Venezuela, it has not considered imposing an oil embargo or blacklisting Maduro himself.\nVenezuelan authorities slammed the move.\nFILE PHOTO: National constituent assembly's member Diosdado Cabello speaks during a session of the assembly at Palacio Federal Legislativo in Caracas, Venezuela August 5, 2017. REUTERS/Marco Bello/File Photo “Today the European Union has again shown irrefutable evidence of its notable subordination to the racist government of (U.S. President) Donald Trump,” Venezuela’s Foreign Ministry said in a statement.\n“These decisions show an interventionist and erroneous policy toward our country and are reminiscent of the colonial maneuvers of outdated empires.”\nOil and related products make up three-quarters of Venezuela’s exports to the EU. The country has the world’s largest proven oil reserves.\nFor a list of the officials sanctioned on Monday, please go to: here .pdf%23page\n(Read the Special Report: How a defrocked judge became the chief legal enforcer for Maduro's Venezuela here )\nWriting by Gabriela Baczynska and Girish Gupta; Editing by William Maclean and Phil Berlowitz\n ", "external_links": ["http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=OJ%3aL%3a2018%3a016I%3aFULL&from=EN", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-01-22T20:46:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-23T07:44:14.002+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
