The benchmark fell 0.2 percent on Monday.\nEnergy stocks gained as much as 1.7 percent riding on stronger global oil prices. Whitehaven Coal was among the biggest boosts to the index, climbing 5 percent.\nPapua New Guinea-focused Oil Search Ltd climbed as much as 1 percent after reporting a 12.6 percent rise in fourth-quarter revenue and posting production of 7.59 million barrels of oil equivalent.\n“The production numbers were in line with expectations and compared to the previous periods, they were certainly moving in the right direction,” said Conway.\nAustralian healthcare stocks got a boost as the medical equipment maker ResMed Inc hit record high after reporting quarterly revenue of $601.3 million, a 13 percent rise compared with the same period last year.\nThe financial index added to the cheer, rising as much as 0.8 percent, with Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Ltd jumping 1.5 percent to its best day in over a month.\nThe other “big-four” banks gained in the range of 0.7 percent to 1.2 percent.\nMeanwhile, QBE Insurance Group fell as much as 6 percent to its lowest in over 3-months after Australia’s biggest insurer said it expected to report a full-year after-tax loss of about $1.2 billion, hurt by impairment charges in its North American operations.\nStrong iron ore and base-metal prices lent support to material stocks, which gained as much as 0.6 percent.\nNew Zealand’s benchmark S&P/NZX 50 index fell 0.2 percent or 13.3 points to 8,322.06. The index is on track to snap two straight days of gains.\nTelecom stocks and consumer cyclicals were among the top losers, with Spark New Zealand Ltd marking its sharpest fall in over 2-months.\nReporting by Sandhya Sampath in Bengaluru; Editing by Sam Holmes\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-23T03:17:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-23T03:48:56.008+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
