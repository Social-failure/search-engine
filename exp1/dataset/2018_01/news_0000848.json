Why? Quite simply, I just know.” \nPalmer enjoyed early success with Cincinnati as he led them to a division title in 2005 but on the first snap of his first playoff game he suffered a torn ACL after taking a low hit. \nAfter a lackluster stint in Oakland where he won eight games over two seasons, Palmer rejuvenated his career in Arizona under head coach Bruce Arians’ vertical-passing scheme and alongside future Hall of Fame receiver Larry Fitzgerald. \nBut Palmer’s career was hampered by injuries, including in the 2014 season when he missed Arizona’s playoff run with a torn ACL. \nPalmer, who missed the final nine games of Arizona’s season with a broken arm, ends his NFL career 12th on the all-time rankings with 294 touchdown passes. \nHe also hold the Cardinals franchise records for passing yards and passing touchdowns in a season, both marks set in 2015. \nArians announced his retirement on Monday and Fitzgerald, 34, has said he does not know if he will return for the NFL’s 2018 season.
