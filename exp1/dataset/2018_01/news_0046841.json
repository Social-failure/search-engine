Custeel’s chief analyst Hu Yanping said Fortescue will use its iron ore price index as part of its payment scheme.\nBHP, which used Mysteel for spot cargoes in 2015, said it was committed to the development of a range of credible iron ore indices.\n“The use of Mysteel Iron Ore Index supports BHP’s wish to meet customer demand and ensure transparent and robust pricing,” it said in an emailed statement.\nFortescue did not comment directly on price formulas but said it has been working with customers in China, its largest market, and recognised the increasing maturity of Chinese indices.\nIMPORTED ORE DOMINATES The pricing change was spearheaded by the China Iron & Steel Association, an industry body representing medium and large-sized mills, which raised the issue with foreign miners last year, a source familiar with the matter said.\nIron ore prices have rebounded in the past couple of years, but most forecasters see prices weakening in 2018 on the back of slower Chinese economic growth and Beijing’s efforts to tackle overcapacity and air pollution.\n“Miners have high sales pressure and have offered to use Chinese indices for settlement,” said one mill source, declining to be named as he’s not authorised to speak to media.\nCitic’s Zhou said there was little difference between Platts and Mysteel indices on a monthly average basis, but prices could differ on particular days, which had led to some dissatisfaction from Chinese mills.\nS&P Global Platts head of Metals Vera Blei said the company’s benchmarks aimed to reflect the market, and the company actively consults with market participants.\nRecent formal consultations had allowed Platts to evolve its benchmarks, in line with changes in the iron ore market as it became more precise and efficient, she said in an emailed statement.\nBrazil’s Vale said in an email the company uses different market indices for spot deals, while Rio Tinto said iron ore pricing was confidential.\nReporting by Ruby Lian and Josephine Mason; Additional reporting by Manolo Serapio Jr in MANILA, Sonali Paul in MELBOURNE, Shanghai newsroom, Luciano Costa de Paula in SAO PAULO; editing by Richard Pullin\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-26T02:21:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-26T02:56:55.013+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
