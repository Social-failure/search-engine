The database incorporates fingerprints and iris scans, besides basic information details. \n“Mere display of demographic information can’t be misused without biometrics,” it added, ruling out financial fraud, saying access to bank accounts required further authentication that involved fingerprint and iris scans. \nBut the breach is the latest in a program facing increasing scrutiny over privacy concerns and is likely to prompt further questions about data safety. \nIndia’s Supreme Court is holding hearings to decide if a drive by the administration of Prime Minister Narendra Modi to link Aadhaar to private and public services infringes the privacy rights of individuals. \n“The perils of making Aadhaar mandatory and linking it to bank accounts, as insisted upon by the Modi government, are visible here,” Sitaram Yechury, a leader of the communist party, said in a Twitter post. \n“Do we need more proof to stop this madness?” \nLast month, the agency barred telecoms firm Bharti Airtel and its Airtel Payments Bank from using Aadhaar details to verify customers’ identities, because the facility was being misused to open accounts on its payment platform. \n($1=63.3925 Indian rupees)", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-04T15:48:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-04T16:00:20.002+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
