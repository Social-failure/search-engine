An effective nuclear deterrent was also less expensive than war, it said. New weapons \nThe draft document noted that Russia and China were modernizing their nuclear arsenals, while North Korea's nuclear provocations \"threaten regional and global peace.\" \nThe draft document said the United States, while honoring all treaty commitments, would pursue development of a new nuclear-armed sea-launched cruise missile. It would also modify a small number of existing submarine-launched ballistic missile, or SLBM, warheads to provide a nuclear option with a lower payload. \nIn what arms control experts said appeared to be a nod to the threat of a devastating cyber attack, perhaps one that could knock down the U.S. power grid, the document also left open the possibility of nuclear retaliation in \"extreme circumstances.\" \n\"Extreme circumstances could include significant non-nuclear strategic attacks,\" it said. \nKingston Reif, director for disarmament research at the Arms Control Association advocacy group, said the draft document was a departure from long-standing U.S. policy. \n\"It expands the scenarios under which the United States might use nuclear weapons and therefore increases the risk of nuclear weapons use,\" Rief said. \nAlthough it reaffirmed an Obama-era pledge not to use or threaten to use nuclear weapons against non-nuclear weapons states if they joined and adhered to the nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, the draft introduced a caveat. The United States reserved the right to alter that assurance, given the evolving threat from non-nuclear technologies. \nMichaela Dodge, senior policy analyst at the Heritage Foundation, said the draft document appeared to be intentionally ambiguous about when and how the United States might retaliate, to better deter adversaries. \n\"If we are explicit about saying (when) we will not retaliate with the strongest weapons we have, we are implicitly telling our adversaries you can plan for these scenarios more freely,\" Dodge said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-13T05:52:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-13T06:03:56.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
