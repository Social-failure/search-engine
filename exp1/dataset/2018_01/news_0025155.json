Chicago intends for now to limit the minutes of LaVine, the centerpiece of a draft-day trade that sent Jimmy Butler to Minnesota.\nBut even that playing time cap couldn’t slow down the Bulls, who grabbed an 84-65 lead with 1:51 left in the third quarter on a Jerian Grant 18-footer and then held off Miami.\nLauri Markkanen hit a 3-pointer with 68 seconds left to seal the victory for Chicago, which entered Monday with the 12th-worst record in the Eastern Conference but is within striking distance of the eighth-seeded Bucks. Markkanen finished with 17 points and nine rebounds.\nHoliday made a career-high seven 3-point shots for Chicago and Niko Mirotic had 18 points and five rebounds off the bench.\nThe Heat had managed to stay hot despite the absence of guard Dion Waiters, the team’s second-leading scorer who is expected to have season-ending ankle surgery. Waiters, who averages 14.3 points per game, missed his 10th straight contest.\nBut they couldn’t keep pace with the Bulls, who made 16 of 39 3-point tries.\nKelly Olynyk had 21 points and eight assists off the bench for Miami and Wayne Ellington added 20 points.\n--Field Level Media\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-01-16T07:15:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-16T13:26:49.031+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
