Wall Street largely anticipated the change, sending stocks to record highs in 2017.\n\"As you talk to CEOs outside of the United States, the United States seemingly becomes more attractive. We have a talented workforce,\" Moynihan said . \"We have tremendous energy resources. We have a rule of law around working and employment flexibility, and we have regulatory environment that's swinging back in.\"\nMoynihan took over as Bank of America's chief executive 2010.
