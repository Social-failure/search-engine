League leader Matteo Salvini hit back on Wednesday.\n“Free interpretations of my thinking make me laugh,” he told la Repubblica newspaper. “I remain convinced ... that the euro under these conditions was an error. Which we will put right.”\nAllied with France’s National Front in the European Parliament, the League blames the euro for rising poverty in the bloc, saying it only favors economic powerhouse Germany.\nOnce one of the most pro-EU nations in Europe, Italy has become more hostile towards Brussels in recent years. A survey released by the Bertelsmann Foundation last October showed 83 percent of Italians were not satisfied with the direction of the EU against an average of 66 percent across the 28-nation bloc.\nThe anti-system 5-Star Movement has also seized on this disaffection, pledging a referendum on euro membership if Brussels does not agree to change the bloc’s fiscal rules.

REUTERS/Tony Gentile/File Photo But in France, the National Front’s anti-euro stance contributed to a bruising defeat at the hands of pro-EU centrist Emanuel Macron last spring. Marine Le Pen’s party has since softened its position, leaving the Northern League more isolated within Europe in its push for a euro-exit. [nL8N1MM3VG]\n“Before, we had a concrete hope of creating a group of nations that could have immediately demolished the euro ... Sadly we no longer have that, so we need to approach it unilaterally,” Claudio Borghi Aquilini, the League’s head of economic policy, told Reuters.\n“Our plan is still to try to leave the euro as soon as possible, but ‘as soon as possible’ means being ready to do so,” he said, giving no indication of how long it would take.\nOne of the League’s flagship proposals is to introduce a parallel currency for domestic use, issuing small-denomination bonds to firms and individuals owed money by the state.\nBorghi said such instruments could become a sovereign currency in an emergency.\nBerlusconi, who cannot run personally in the election because of a tax fraud conviction, also proposes a dual currency, but does not back abandoning the euro. [nL8N1LP4E9]\nBuilding consensus in a center-right coalition for a radical exit will be difficult, Borghi said, partly because Italy’s economy is now growing modestly. But any future intransigence from European authorities could help that cause, he added.\n“If we start with the idea that we always have to say ‘yes’ to whatever they ask of us, because we must stay in the euro at all costs, it’s over, it’s worse than a military defeat,” he said.\nReporting by Isla Binnie; Editing by Crispian Balmer and Catherine Evans\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-03T17:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-03T17:57:25.006+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
