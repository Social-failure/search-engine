This is the first time a Canadian official has acknowledged that is the most likely outcome.\nBoeing Co, the world’s largest maker of jetliners, accuses the Canadian firm of dumping planes on the U.S. market.\nAn ITC spokeswoman was not immediately available for comment. The source declined to be identified due to the sensitivity of the matter.
