He faces life in prison if convicted.\nUllah was previously charged in a criminal complaint filed by prosecutors shortly after his arrest last month. His court-appointed lawyer, Amy Gallicchio, could not immediately be reached for comment on Wednesday.\nAccording to prosecutors, Ullah attempted to detonate a pipe bomb secured to his body in a pedestrian tunnel in the subway station in Manhattan’s Times Square that is connected to the sprawling Port Authority Bus Terminal on the morning of Dec. 11.\nUllah was hospitalized for injuries suffered after the bomb ignited but failed to detonate as intended, while three other people suffered minor injuries, according to prosecutors.\nUllah told police officers after the blast that he “did it for the Islamic State,” according to the criminal complaint.\nProsecutors said that Ullah, who has lived in the United States since 2011, began his self-radicalization in 2014 when he started viewing pro-Islamic State materials online. Inside Ullah’s passport, which was recovered from his home, was a handwritten note that read, “O AMERICA, DIE IN YOUR RAGE,” according to the complaint.\nMonirul Islam, head of the Bangladesh police’s counterterrorism unit, told Reuters shortly after the attack in December that his country had found no evidence linking Ullah to militants in his home country.\nReporting by Brendan Pierson in New York; Editing by Leslie Adler\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-10T23:57:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-11T00:01:51.012+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
