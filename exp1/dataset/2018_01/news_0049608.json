They were also talking about a different concert in South Korea by a North Korean orchestra and sending South Korean athletes to train at a North Korean ski resort.

North Korea has at least two major holidays coming up next month - Kim Jong Il’s birthday and a military founding anniversary. \nSeoul said North Korea’s decision to cancel the joint performance was “very regrettable” and stressed Pyongyang should uphold all agreements made between North and South Korea.
