The focus of the interview was memos Comey had written about his interactions with Trump as FBI director, according to a source cited by NBC News. \nMueller is probing not only Russian meddling in the election, but also whether Trump attempted to obstruct justice in connection with the Russia investigation. \nSessions recused himself from any probe of Russia after it was revealed that he had failed to disclose to Congress contacts he had during the 2016 campaign with Russia's ambassador to the United States. \nTrump was angry over Sessions's recusal, reportedly because he wanted the attorney general to protect him in a probe. \nAfter Sessions stepped aside in the case, Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein appointed Mueller as special counsel. \nMueller's probe has bedeviled the Trump administration for months. \nThe special counsel's team has indicted former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort on a charger of working as an unregistered agent on behalf of the pro-Russia government of Ukraine, and obtained a guilty plea from former Trump national security advisor Michael Flynn on a charge of lying to the FBI about his postelection conversations with Russia's ambassador. \nFlynn is now cooperating with Mueller's investigation as a condition of his plea deal.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-23T21:44:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-23T22:09:53.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
