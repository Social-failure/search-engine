The offer was a 109 percent premium to Ablynx’s share price prior to Novo Nordisk’s bid on Jan 8.\nAblynx shares were suspended from trading until 1030 local time (0930 GMT), the Belgian market regulator said.\nShares in Swedish medical technology group Getinge sank 8.4 percent to the bottom of the STOXX after it reported fourth-quarter profit far below market forecasts, and said 2018 results would be affected by currency transactions.\nOverall, European stocks kept a decisive cyclical tilt, with miners, autos, financial services and tech all gaining while utilities, food and beverage and real estate stocks slipped.\nSpain’s Enagas fell 3.8 percent after Kepler Cheuvreux cut its target price on the stock.
