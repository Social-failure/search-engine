(NYSE:QD) who purchased American Depositary Shares pursuant to the October 17, 2017 Initial Public Offering and/or between October 18, 2017 and November 20, 2017. The action, which was filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, alleges that the Company violated federal securities laws.\nThe complaint alleges that the Registration Statement issued in connection with the IPO failed to disclose that: (1) Qudian engaged in unethical business and accounting practices; (2) Qudian failed to maintain adequate control to ensure the protection and safety of its usersâ€™ personal information; and (3) as a result, Qudian was exposing detailed user data to leakages and online resale.\nShareholders have until February 12, 2018 to petition the court for lead plaintiff status.
