It did not say where. \nMotorhead formed in London in 1975 and released more than 20 studio albums. Original frontman Ian “Lemmy” Kilmister, and drummer Phil Taylor both died in 2015. \nClarke played on Motorhead’s biggest hits, including the albums “Ace of Spades,”“No Sleep ‘til Hammersmith” and the 1981 British hit single “Motorhead.” \nHe left Motorhead in 1982 at the height of its success to form the band Fastway. Having started off in a blues band, Clarke later returned to blues music and released what would be his final album, “Make My Day, Back to Blues” in 2014.
