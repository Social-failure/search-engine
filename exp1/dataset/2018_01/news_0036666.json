Marketing arms are common in the pipeline industry, and most of the top 10 largest U.S. pipeline operators have already established their own marketing or trading arms. \nMagellan requested a rehearing on Dec. 22, in a filing that rivals said raised new issues that could have far-reaching consequences for the oil industry and could jeopardize existing marketing affiliates. \nLast week, oil and gas producers WPX Energy and Chevron asked FERC for a new hearing on the broad industry impact of Magellan’s request.
