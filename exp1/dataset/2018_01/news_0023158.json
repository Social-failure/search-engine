Many Senate Democrats were noncommittal Tuesday over whether they would allow a shutdown in an election year in which control of the Senate is in play. \nCommentary: If politicians can’t pass a budget, what makes them think they can do the hard stuff? \nRepublicans were already preparing to accuse Democrats of shutting services because they didn’t get an immigration deal. But Democrats said Trump’s dismissal of “shithole countries” in Africa in a closed meeting last week with lawmakers positioned him as the person who upset the negotiations. \nThe immigration issue is growing more urgent as the calendar ticks toward March 5, the date Trump set for the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, or DACA, to end officially. Trump killed the Obama-era program in September and urged Congress to negotiate a replacement. \nOn Tuesday, Sen. Lindsey Graham (R., S.C.), an architect of the bipartisan Senate immigration plan, quizzed Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen on whether she understood that Republicans weren’t going to get everything they want in a compromise deal. And he bemoaned the seeming transformation of Trump from the deal-making optimist on display at a bipartisan discussion a week ago.
