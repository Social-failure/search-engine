Special Envoy for Syria Staffan de Mistura, told reporters he expected “a long meeting”. \nWith a breakthrough unlikely, a question at the centre of Friday’s discussions was whether the opposition will attend a Syria peace conference next week in the Russian Black Sea resort town of Sochi, which Moscow announced after the last round of U.N. talks in December.

REUTERS/Alex Halada/Pool \nWestern powers and some Arab states believe Sochi is an attempt to create a parallel political track that would undermine the United Nations and lay groundwork for a solution more suitable to the Damascus government and its allies. \n“We will tell you today, hopefully,” opposition spokesman Yahya Aridi told reporters as his delegation arrived, when asked if the opposition would attend Sochi. Slideshow (2 Images) \nThe warring sides have not spoken face to face -- a Syrian government delegation was due to meet De Mistura in the afternoon. De Mistura was expected to make a statement at the end of the talks. \nNeither side has commented on the content of this week’s closed-door talks. \nPrevious rounds have taken place sporadically in Geneva, with a mandate to discuss new elections, reformed governance, a new constitution and the fight against terrorism. \nAt the last round in December, the Syrian government delegation objected to the opposition’s tough line on the future of Assad, and those talks achieved nothing. \nSyrian government forces are pursuing offensives against two remaining rebel pockets, Idlib in the northwest and eastern Ghouta near Damascus. Turkey has poured troops into the north to fight Kurdish militias that have established regional autonomy and are seen by Ankara as a menace to its security.
