But it is no longer predicted to reach Category 3, or severe strength, according to advice issued by the Australian Bureau of Meteorology overnight.\nWidespread heavy rain, wind gusts of up to 120 km per hour and strong tides are still predicted to pummel the region, and residents of Broome, a coastal town about 90 km from the storm, are ordered to take shelter.\nHowever the very destructive winds previously forecast are no longer expected and once the storm makes landfall it is predicted to weaken as it travels inland.\nPort Hedland, which accounts for over half of Australia’s iron ore exports, handling more than a million tonnes a day and most of it bound for Chinese steel mills, was cleared and closed on Thursday.\nPilbara Ports Authority, which operates Port Hedland, said it was monitoring the storm’s effects on ports further south at Dampier and Ashburton as well, but has not updated its advice since the weather bureau’s revised forecast.\nThe storm is the second to menace Australia’s northwest in as many weeks, since Cyclone Hilda blew down trees and caused minor damage at Broome last week.\nOn average, there are 10 to 13 tropical cyclones between November and April in the Australian region, four of which typically cross the coast, data from the bureau shows.\nReporting by Tom Westbrook; editing by Diane Craft\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-01-12T06:43:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-12T18:52:04.043+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
