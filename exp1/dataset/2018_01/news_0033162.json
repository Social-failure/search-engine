The production fall has hit oil exports – its only major source of foreign currency to repay debt - and refining, creating intermittent fuel scarcity in the country and at some of its main allies, such as Cuba. \nAn alleged crackdown on oil graft in the last few months, seen by critics as an effort by President Nicolas Maduro to consolidate power, has sown panic across the energy industry and all but paralysed state oil company PDVSA, according to people at the firm and in the sector. \nIt is a remarkable downfall for the OPEC member home to the world’s biggest crude reserves. \n“This is one of the worst collapses in history. It happened without an invasion like in Iraq, the breakup of a country like in the Soviet Union, or a civil war like in Libya,” said Francisco Monaldi, a fellow in Latin American Energy Policy from Rice University’s Baker Institute. Venezuela’s oil ministry and PDVSA [PDVSA.UL] did not respond to a request for comment. \nThe output drop is likely to worsen a bitter recession and hyperinflation that have poor Venezuelans skipping meals or eating from the garbage. \nOpposition politicians say Venezuela’s inefficient state-led economic model and rampant corruption are to blame for the oil industry’s meltdown. \n“This is the most irresponsible act against the Venezuelan people. They destroyed the industry that generates almost 96 percent of the country’s foreign revenue,” said opposition lawmaker Elias Matta. \nSocialist Maduro retorts that U.S.-backed opposition supporters have sabotaged the oil sector. HOW LOW WILL IT GO? \nVenezuela’s oil gloom is set to persist this year, with the main question among analysts just how low its production will fall. \nJust in December, Venezuela’s output sank by 216,000 bpd from November to 1.621 million bpd, the OPEC figures showed, a 29-percent drop from December 2016 levels. \nVenezuela’s new oil czar, former housing minister General Manuel Quevedo, has vowed that output will rise to more than 2.4 million bpd this year. But Quevedo, who has no experience in the energy sector, has yet to provide a detailed plan.January has seen an unprecedented surge in resignations, spurred by dislike of the new management and salaries that often do not allow workers to eat properly, current and former PDVSA employees say. \nStill, the most vulnerable oilfields have already clocked the sharpest drops, according to Monaldi, which could limit this year’s decline. He forecasts production to fall another 250,000 bpd-350,000 bpd in 2018, starting from December’s average. \nOil consultancy Energy Aspects also expects a drop of at least 200,000 bpd in 2018, helping to balance an oversupplied global oil market. \n“Underperformance by Venezuela helps OPEC to reach its overall (production cut) target quicker for sure. Once balance is achieved, they will taper the cuts,” Amrita Sen, co-founder of the firm, told Reuters. \nA further production fall could also push cash-strapped Venezuela into full default, which experts say would be one of the largest and messiest credit events in history. Maduro said last year that Venezuela wanted to restructure its foreign debt, which includes some $60 billion in bonds issued by PDVSA and the government, and has been late with bond payments in the last few months. \nAs Venezuela is still making efforts to pay, holders of some of the world’s highest yielding debt have so far been tolerant of the delays, but that could change if Venezuela is perceived to no longer have enough income to pay.
