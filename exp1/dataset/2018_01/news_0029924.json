We will work with the C-NLOPB and take the actions necessary to satisfy the regulator,” Husky’s chief executive officer, Rob Peabody, said in a statement.\nHusky spokesman Mel Duvall said the company does not know for how long the SeaRose FPSO will be shut down.\nThe C-NLOPB said SeaRose operations will remain suspended until it is confident Husky has addressed the findings in the investigation.\nThe SeaRose FPSO began operations in 2005 and serves the White Rose field as well as the North Amethyst, West White Rose and South White Rose extensions.
