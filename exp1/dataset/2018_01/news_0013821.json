Reuters/Kim Hong-Ji \nSEOUL (Reuters) - The South Korean government on Thursday said it plans to ban cryptocurrency trading, sending bitcoin prices plummeting and throwing the virtual coin market into turmoil as the nation's police and tax authorities raided local exchanges on alleged tax evasion. \nThe clampdown in South Korea, a crucial source of global demand for cryptocurrency, came as policymaker around the world struggled to regulate an asset whose value has skyrocketed over the last year. \nJustice minister Park Sang-ki said the government is preparing a bill to ban trading of the virtual currency on domestic exchanges. \n\"There are great concerns regarding virtual currencies and justice ministry is basically preparing a bill to ban cryptocurrency trading through exchanges,\" said Park at a press conference, according to the ministry's press office. ADVERTISEMENT \nA press official said the proposed ban on cryptocurrency trading was announced after \"enough discussion\" with other government agencies including the nation's finance ministry and financial regulators. \nOnce a bill is drafted, legislation for an outright ban of virtual coin trading will require a majority vote of the total 297 members of the National Assembly, a process that could take months or even years. \nThe government's tough stance triggered a selloff of the cyrptocurrency on both local and offshore exchanges. ADVERTISEMENT \nThe local price of bitcoin plunged as much as 21 percent in midday trade to 18.3 million won ($17,064.53) after the minister's comments. It still trades at around a 30 percent premium compared to other countries. \nBitcoin BTC=BTSP was down more than 10 percent on the Luxembourg-based Bitstamp at $13,199, after earlier dropping as low as $13,120, its weakest since Jan. 2. \nSouth Korea’s cryptocurrency-related shares were also hammered. Vidente ( 121800.KQ ) and Omnitel ( 057680.KQ ), which are stakeholders of Bithumb, skidded by the daily trading limit of 30 percent each. \nPark Nok-sun, a cryptocurrency analyst at NH Investment & Securities, said the herd behavior in South Korea's virtual coin market has raised concerns. \nIndeed, bitcoin BTC=BTSP's 1,500 percent surge last year has stoked huge demand for cryptocurency in South Korea, drawing college students to housewives and sparking worries of a gambling addiction. \n\"Virtual coins trade at a hefty premium in South Korea, and that is herd behavior showing how strong demand is here,\" Park said. \"Some officials are pushing for stronger and stronger regulations because they only see more (investors) jumping in, not out.\" RAIDS \nThere are more than a dozen cryptocurrency exchanges in South Korea, according to Korea Blockchain Industry Association. \nThe proliferation of the virtual currency and the accompanying trading frenzy have raised eyebrows among regulators globally, though many central banks have refrained from supervising cryptocurrencies themselves. \nThe news on South Korea's proposed ban came as authorities tightened their grip on some of the cryptocurrency exchanges. \nThe nation's largest cryptocurrency exchanges like Coinone and Bithumb were raided by police and tax agencies this week for alleged tax evasion. The raids follow moves by the finance ministry to identify ways to tax the market that has become as big as the nation's small-cap Kosdaq index in terms of daily trading volume. \nSome investors appeared to have taken preemptive action. \n\"I have already cashed most of mine (virtual coins) as I was aware that something was coming up in a couple of days,” said Eoh Kyung-hoon, a 23-year old investor. \nBitcoin sank on Monday after website CoinMarketCap removed prices from South Korean exchanges, because coins were trading at a premium of about 30 percent in Asia's fourth largest economy. That created confusion and triggered a broad selloff among investors. \nAn official at Coinone told Reuters that a few officials from the National Tax Service raided the company's office this week. \n\"Local police also have been investigating our company since last year, they think what we do is gambling,\" the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said and added that Coinone was cooperating with the investigation. ADVERTISEMENT \nBithumb, the second largest virtual currency operator in South Korea, was also raided by the tax authorities on Wednesday. \n\"We were asked by the tax officials to disclose paperwork and things yesterday,\" an official at Bithumb said, requesting anonymity due to the sensitivity of the issue. \nThe nation's tax office and police declined to confirm whether they raided the local exchanges. \nSouth Korean financial authorities had previously said they are inspecting six local banks that offer virtual currency accounts to institutions, amid concerns the increasing use of such assets could lead to a surge in crime. \n($1 = 1,069.9600 won) ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-11T05:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-11T05:43:21.010+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
