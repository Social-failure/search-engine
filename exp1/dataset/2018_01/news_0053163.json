The deal was an easy one,” Barca president Josep Maria Bartomeu told a news conference. \nPique also said on the club’s website (www.fcbarcelona.com) that there was never any question of him playing anywhere else. \n“I can only see myself in a Barca shirt. If I had not extended my contract then I would have stopped playing because I only play football because I play for Barca,” he said. \nPique has won three Champions League and six Liga titles plus five King’s Cup, five Spanish Super Cup, two European Super Cup and three FIFA Club World Cup trophies with Barca.
