Emergency management spokesman Richard Rapoza confirmed to USA TODAY that the agency received the threats via anonymous telephone calls.\n\"We understand that members of our community are angry about Saturday's false alarm, and we are looking at these messages as individuals blowing off steam,\" Rapoza said in a statement. \"While we take any threat against our personnel seriously, we are doing our best not to escalate the situation.\"\nHawaii is about 4,500 miles from Pyongyang, and the vocal military threats from North Korean leader Kim Jong Un are taken seriously by state officials. The state has been working to upgrade the missile warning program.\nRead more from USA Today:\nHawaii changes protocols for alerts after missile false alarm\nFalse ballistic missile alert rattles Hawaii\nFloor collapses at Jakarta stock exchange; nearly 80 hurt\nThe chaos began Saturday at 8:05 a.m. during a routine internal test involving the state's much ballyhooed Emergency Alert System. But the employee hit the live-alert button by mistake, and at 8:07 a.m. this alert was erroneously pushed to cellphones across the state: \"Missile threat inbound to Hawaii. Seek immediate shelter. This is not a drill.\"\nThree minutes later, the agency had confirmed that there was in fact no missile threat. Police were quickly notified and social media announced the mistake. But the text explaining the error wasn't sent for 38 minutes, in part because no such text had been pre-scripted.\nFinally came this missive: \"There is no missile threat or danger to the State of Hawaii. Repeat. False Alarm.\"\nThe confusion resulted in controlled bedlam as Hawaiians dashed for cover, hid in basements and reached out to friends and loved ones. In Manoa, the Durkin family huddled in an underground bunker built in their home after the attack on Pearl Harbor in 1941.\n\"We just started throwing supplies into the bomb shelter and closed the top and got on our phones to look for updates,\" Paraluman Stice-Durkin told Hawaii News Now.\n@GovHawaii tweet\nGov. David Ige quickly issued an apology for the alert.\n\"I am sorry for the pain and confusion it caused,\" he said. \"I, too, am extremely upset about this and am doing everything I can do to immediately improve our emergency management systems, procedures and staffing.\"\nChanges are already underway. Alerts now will require activation and verification by two people, the agency said. And a cancellation command has been written and can be issued within seconds of an error.\nPresident Trump even weighed in, suggesting that federal officials will become more involved in Hawaii's notification program. And Federal Communications Commission Chairman Ajit Pai said his agency is investigating.\n\"Based on the information we have collected so far, it appears that the government of Hawaii did not have reasonable safeguards or process controls in place,\" Pai said. \"Moving forward, we will focus on what steps need to be taken to prevent a similar incident from happening again.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-15T07:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-15T19:51:25.026+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
