The sector accounted for 7.8 percent of the economy.\nBut real estate growth picked up, growing 4.8 percent versus 3.9 percent a quarter earlier, as property markets in China’s big urban centres stabilised while smaller cities gained some momentum.\nReal estate contributed 6.3 percent to GDP in the quarter.\nThe retail and wholesale sector slowed to 6.9 percent from more than 7 percent in previous quarters as consumption of physical goods such as autos lost momentum.\nIn December, the retail sales growth of 9.4 percent was the slowest since February 2006, undershooting forecasts.\nOf note, the tech sector, which accounted for about 3 percent of GDP in October-December, sustained its double-digit growth in the quarter.\nThe sector expanded 33.8 percent compared with 26 percent in July-September.\nChina’s overall economy grew 6.8 percent in the fourth quarter, better than expected, as an export recovery helped the country post its first annual acceleration in growth in seven years.\nThat’s welcome news for policymakers looking to cut debt and pollution in older industries without stunting growth in the world’s second-largest economy.
