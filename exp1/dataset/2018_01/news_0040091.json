The insurance charge was double what GE had warned last year. \n“We’ve been notified by the SEC that they are investigating the process leading to the insurance reserve increase and fourth quarter charge, as well as GE’s revenue recognition and controls for long-term service agreements,” CFO Jamie Miller told analysts on a call after announcing earnings earlier on Wednesday. “We are cooperating fully with the investigation, which is in very early stages.” (Reporting by Alwyn Scott; Editing by Bill Rigby)", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-24T16:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-24T17:14:52.068+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
