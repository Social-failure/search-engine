Gupta, managing director at Taurus Asset Management.\nIndia lowered its forecast for the current year’s economic growth to 6.5 percent on Friday from the earlier estimated 7.5 percent, before a federal budget is released next month, as businesses were hit by the chaotic launch of new nationwide tax last July.\nIndications of slightly better earnings this season versus the last quarter has also added to the optimism, Gupta said.\nFinancials and IT stocks gained, with Infosys Ltd and ICICI Bank Ltd helping the indexes gain.\nInfosys, which is due to report December-quarter results on Friday, rose 1.8 percent, while ICICI Bank climbed 1.2 percent.\nPharma stocks also advanced, with the Nifty Pharma index up as much as 2.5 percent to a two-month high.\nSun Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd rose 3.2 percent and was among the top gainers on the indexes.\nReal estate developer Sobha Ltd rose as much as 14.8 percent to its highest in over nine years following its highest ever quarterly sales performance.\nMeanwhile, Asian shares ex-Japan crept toward all-time peaks on Monday after Wall Street posted its best start to a year in over a decade.
