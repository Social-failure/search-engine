Prime Minister Theresa May appears ready to accept that, assuring disappointed Brexit supporters who say it will turn Britain into a “vassal state” that it is just for a short time. \nNegotiations are likely to focus on the complexities of that status quo, including giving Britain a non-voting seat at some EU meetings, how to determine current matters like annual fishing quotas and how the EU might allow London to sign up to new trade deals with other countries while bound by EU accords. \nThe other 27 member states have also agreed to consider an extension to the transition period if more time is needed to conclude the free trade accord, which both sides say they want to have in place and working by January 2021. \nTalks on that trade deal should start after EU leaders agree in March on new instructions for their negotiators.
