(NYSE:CUBI), the parent company of Customers Bank (collectively “Customers”), reported net income to common shareholders of $18.0 million for the fourth quarter of 2017 (\"Q4 2017\") compared to net income to common shareholders of $16.2 million for the fourth quarter of 2016 (\"Q4 2016\"), an increase of $1.8 million, or 11.0%. Fully diluted earnings per common share for Q4 2017 was $0.55 compared to $0.51 fully diluted earnings per common share for Q4 2016, an increase of $0.04, or 7.8%.\n“2017 was a strong year for Customers, with the core Community Business Banking segment, the continuing business of Customers once the BankMobile spin-off has been completed, generating earnings of $2.60 per diluted share, excluding the Religare impairment and gains on sales of investment securities (a non-GAAP measure). As we resume a moderate pace of growth in 2018, we are focused on our plans to divest BankMobile, build capital through retained earnings, and strengthen performance at the Community Business Banking segment with a further developing focus on core deposit funding, which we believe will drive above average shareholder value,” stated Jay Sidhu, CEO and Chairman of Customers Bank. “In the fourth quarter of 2017, we actively shrank the balance sheet to improve our capital ratios and continue to maintain our small issuer status under the Durbin Amendment until July 1, 2019, if needed. Tax reform required a reduction in the value of our deferred tax asset during the fourth quarter, the effect of which was offset by the elections by employees to exercise options and the vesting of restricted stock units. More importantly for Customers, tax reform is expected to significantly increase our earnings power and internal capital generation in 2018 and beyond,” concluded Mr. Sidhu.\nIn Q4 2017, Customers recorded a deferred tax asset re-measurement charge to its income tax expense of $5.5 million ($0.17 per diluted share) as a result of the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017. The one-time tax effect was offset by a $7.3 million ($0.23 per diluted share) benefit from exercises of employee stock options, principally by Customers' CEO, and vesting of restricted stock units.\nCustomers also reported net income to common shareholders of $64.4 million for the full year of 2017 compared to net income to common shareholders of $69.2 million for the full year of 2016, a decrease of $4.8 million, or 7.0%. Fully diluted earnings per common share was $1.97 for the full year of 2017 compared to $2.31 for 2016, a decrease of 14.7%. In addition to the Q4 2017 income tax impacts noted above, in 2017 Customers recorded impairment charges for its equity investment in Religare Enterprises Ltd. (\"Religare\") totaling $12.9 million, or approximately $0.40 per diluted share, which was mitigated in part by gains on sales of investment securities of $8.8 million, or approximately $0.17 per diluted share.\nOutlook\n“Looking to 2018, we understand that there is a need to provide greater transparency into our business given the planned divestiture of BankMobile and tax reform,” stated Mr. Sidhu. “To clarify our business expectations, Customers will provide more guidance for 2018. Specifically, Customers is currently targeting moderate growth in 2018 and diluted EPS of $2.75 to $3.00 from the Community Business Banking segment, which is our core franchise which will remain as our continuing business after the spin-off and merger has been completed.”\nCustomers expects the Community Business Banking segment to grow total assets approximately 12% to 15% in 2018, and expects net interest margin will remain in a range between 2.70% to 2.80%. The efficiency ratio at the Community Business Banking segment in 2018 is expected to be in the mid to high 40%s, with expected fee income of approximately $35 million to $40 million. We estimate an effective consolidated tax rate of approximately 24%. Customers expects to continue to experience notable seasonality with first quarter earnings, which are impacted by lower average balances in the mortgage warehouse business, a shorter day count, and an increase in compensation expense.\nCustomers continues to expect to complete the divestiture of BankMobile sometime in mid-2018. BankMobile’s business is seasonal, and the full year earnings impact of BankMobile on Customers' results of operations will depend on the exact time of divestiture; however, it is currently Customers’ expectation that BankMobile's segment results will range between a slight profit and a $4.5 million loss per quarter until its divestiture.\nStrategic Priorities\nStrengthen Capital\nTotal shareholders' equity at December 31, 2017 increased 7.6% from December 31, 2016 to $921 million. The estimated Tier 1 leverage capital ratio was approximately 9% for Q4 2017 compared to 9.07% for Q4 2016. The estimated total risk-based capital ratio was approximately 13% for Q4 2017 compared to 13.05% for Q4 2016. The estimated common equity Tier 1 capital ratio was approximately 9% for Q4 2017 compared to 8.49% for Q4 2016. The tangible common equity to tangible assets ratio (a non-GAAP measure) was approximately 7% at December 31, 2017 compared to 6.63% at December 31, 2016.\nCustomers recognizes the importance of not only being well capitalized in the current regulatory environment but to have adequate capital buffers to absorb any unexpected shocks. \"Our capital ratios all improved during Q4 2017 as growth in our core loan portfolios was offset by planned sales of lower yielding loans and securities, and seasonal declines in the mortgage warehouse portfolio,\" stated Mr. Sidhu. \"We continue to target a Tier I leverage capital ratio of 9.0% or higher and a total risk-based capital ratio of around 13.0%,\" Mr. Sidhu continued. \"As we go through 2018, we expect capital ratios to trend lower through mid-year given growth in the mortgage warehouse business, but then to rebuild by year end through retained earnings,\" concluded Mr. Sidhu.\nGrow and Successfully Divest BankMobile in 2018\nBankMobile operates a branchless digital bank offering very low cost banking services to its 1.1 million active deposit customers. BankMobile has opened around 536,000 new checking accounts, and converted over 374,000 checking accounts, to BankMobile since June 16, 2016. Deposit balances were approximately $400 million at December 31, 2017, including approximately $395 million of non-interest bearing deposit accounts.\nDuring 2017, the BankMobile segment reported net interest income of $12.9 million, non-interest income of $54.1 million, operating expenses of $87.0 million, provision for loan losses of $1.1 million and a tax benefit of $8.0 million from the operating losses, resulting in a net loss of $13.2 million. The BankMobile segment results include the funds transfer pricing benefit received by the segment for the originated deposits in the segment reporting results at a rate of approximately 2%. Deposits generated by the BankMobile business averaged $558 million for Q4 2017 and $603 million for full year of 2017.\nDuring Q4 2017, the BankMobile segment reported net interest income of $3.2 million, non-interest income of $11.5 million, operating expenses of $20.9 million, provision for loan losses of $0.7 million and a tax benefit of $2.6 million from the operating losses, resulting in a net loss of $4.2 million.\nDuring Q3 2017, Customers decided that the best strategy for its shareholders for divesting BankMobile was to spin-off BankMobile to Customers’ shareholders subject to an agreement with Flagship Community Bank (\"Flagship\") for Flagship to acquire the BankMobile business. The transaction is expected to be completed in mid-2018. Customers expects Flagship to file an application with the FDIC for its acquisition of BankMobile’s deposits shortly. Flagship has further informed Customers that it expects to file a registration statement in connection with its planned capital raise, which is a condition to completion of Flagship's acquisition of BankMobile, with the FDIC after completion of its 2017 financial statement audit.\nOnce Customers has completed its 2017 audited financial statements, it will file a Form 10 with the SEC with respect to the spin-off and the distribution of BankMobile Technologies, Inc. common stock to Customers’ shareholders. Once approvals of the transaction and documents are received from the FDIC and SEC as appropriate, Customers will announce the record date for the distribution of BankMobile Technologies, Inc. shares. Following the spin-off of BankMobile from Customers and merger of BankMobile with Flagship, Customers and Flagship/BankMobile will be entirely separate entities. Customers will retain no ownership in BankMobile, there will be no common employees, facilities, or functions beyond certain temporary support services to BankMobile according to the terms of a Transition Services Agreement and one common director. Following the spin-off and merger, Customers shareholders are to receive tax-free, ownership of over 50% of Flagship common shares.\nGrow and Improve Financial Performance of the Community Business Banking Segment\nPriorities for the Community Business Banking segment in 2018 include strong risk management, core deposit growth, positive operating leverage, a focus on net interest margin, and carefully managed credit risk. Longer term, Customers targets a return on average assets (\"ROAA\") of approximately 1.1%, a return on tangible common equity (\"ROTCE\") (a non-GAAP measure) greater than 12%, net interest margin ranging between 2.80% to 3.00%, a compound annual growth rate (\"CAGR\") of 15% in EPS, and an efficiency ratio in the low 40%s.\nDuring 2017, the Community Business Banking segment reported net income of $77.6 million ($2.38 per diluted share), which included the funds transfer pricing cost paid by the segment for use of BankMobile’s deposits at a rate of approximately 2% of those deposits. Adjusted to exclude both the after-tax impact of securities gains and Religare impairment, the segment generated net income of $84.9 million, or $2.60 per share, which included a deferred tax asset re-measurement charge to income tax expense of $5.5 million ($0.17 per diluted share) as a result of the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 in December 2017 and a $7.3 million benefit ($0.22 per diluted share) from exercises of employee stock options and vesting of restricted stock units. For 2017, the segment reported an ROAA of 0.77%, ROTCE of 12.1% (a non-GAAP measure) and an efficiency ratio of 45.4%, compared to the respective 2016 metrics of 0.82%, 11.7% and 47.8%.\nDuring Q4 2017, the Community Business Banking segment reported net income of $22.2 million ($0.68 per diluted share), which includes the above mentioned deferred tax asset re-measurement charge and benefit from exercises of employee stock options and vesting of restricted stock units. For Q4 2017, the segment reported an ROAA of 0.87%, ROTCE of 13.7% (a non-GAAP measure) and an efficiency ratio of 46.4% compared to the respective Q4 2016 metrics of 0.79%, 11.6% and 43.2%.\nCredit quality at Customers Bank was very strong, as measured by the low level of net charge-offs (7 basis points of average loans in 2017) and nonperforming loans (0.30% of total loans at December 31, 2017), and Customers' lower risk appetite is also reflected in below average asset yields and a somewhat narrow net interest margin.\nCustomers' deposit strategy is to look at the total cost of deposits as the sum of operating and interest costs. Customers’ branch light model, with a focus on cost control, is reflected in dramatically lower operating expenses than the industry - operating expenses in the Community Business Banking segment were equal to 1.27% of average assets in 2017, which we believe is over 100 basis points lower than the industry overall, which enables us to pay somewhat more than our peers in interest rate. Core deposit growth is a strategic priority for Customers. Of note, excluding BankMobile, the Community Business Banking segment grew non-interest bearing demand deposits by 28% in 2017 to $657 million. In 2018, Customers is developing new deposit products and incentives to support our drive to grow low cost core deposits.\nFourth Quarter and 2017 Overview\nThe following table presents a summary of key earnings and performance metrics for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, and for the quarter ended December 31, 2017 and the preceding four quarters, respectively:\nCUSTOMERS BANCORP, INC.

(2) Non-GAAP measure calculated as GAAP net income available to common shareholders, plus provision for loan losses and income tax expense divided by average common equity. (3) Non-GAAP measure calculated as GAAP net interest income, plus tax equivalent interest using a 35% statutory rate divided by average interest earning assets. (4) Regulatory capital ratios are estimated for Q4 2017 and 2017. (5) Non-GAAP measure calculated as GAAP total shareholders' equity less preferred stock and goodwill and other intangibles divided by total assets less goodwill and other intangibles. (6) Non-GAAP measure calculated as GAAP total shareholders' equity less preferred stock and goodwill and other intangibles divided by common shares outstanding at period end. Net interest income\n2017 net interest income of $267.3 million increased $17.8 million, or 7.2%, from 2016 as average interest earning assets increased $1.0 billion, or 11.7%, and the net interest margin narrowed 11 basis points to 2.73%. Q4 2017 net interest income of $68.3 million increased $4.2 million, or 6.5%, from Q4 2016 as average interest earning assets increased $0.7 billion and the Q4 2017 net interest margin narrowed 5 basis points to 2.79% from Q4 2016. Net interest margin compression reflected an increased cost of funds in money market and interest checking deposit accounts and increased borrowings, including the issuance of 3.95% senior notes on June 30, 2017.\n\"Customers' objective is to manage the estimated effect of future interest rate changes, up or down, to about a neutral effect on net interest income, so not speculating on whether interest rates go up or down,\" said Mr. Sidhu. \"The net interest margin compression year over year was principally caused by rising funding costs. To address the risk of rate compression and pressures of a flat yield curve, in Q4 2017 Customers increased loan pricing and sold certain lower yielding assets. For example, in Q4 2017 Customers sold $98 million of securities with a weighted average yield of 2.91%, and in January 2018 it has already purchased $506 million of securities with a weighted average yield of 3.32%. Similarly, in Q4 2017 Customers sold $132 million of multi-family loans with a weighted average yield of 3.32%, and the yield in the multi-family pipeline is currently 3.84%. We will continue to focus on remixing our assets as we work to strengthen core deposit funding to combat margin pressure,\" concluded Mr. Sidhu.\nTotal loans outstanding, including commercial loans held for sale, increased $0.4 billion, or 5.3%, to $8.7 billion as of December 31, 2017 compared to total loans of $8.3 billion as of December 31, 2016. Commercial and industrial loans increased $225 million to $1.6 billion, up 19.2% over December 31, 2016. Commercial loans to mortgage companies decreased $326 million to $1.8 billion, down 15.0% over December 31, 2016. Multi-family loans increased $432 million to $3.6 billion, up 13.4% over December 31, 2016. Commercial non-owner-occupied real estate loans increased $25 million to $1.2 billion, up 2.1% over December 31, 2016. Consumer loans increased by $29 million to $0.3 billion and make up less than 4% of the loan portfolio. In Q4 2017, Customers sold $132 million of multi-family loans for realized gains of $0.2 million and $192 million of consumer residential loans for realized gains of $0.2 million. The weighted average yield on the consumer residential loans sold was 3.73%.\nTotal deposits decreased by $504 million, or 6.9%, to $6.8 billion as of December 31, 2017 compared to total deposits of $7.3 billion as of December 31, 2016. Non-interest bearing demand deposit accounts increased by $86 million or 8.9% to $1.1 billion, interest bearing demand deposit accounts increased $184 million to $524 million, money market deposit accounts increased $157 million to $3.3 billion, and certificates of deposit accounts decreased $926 million to $1.9 billion, reflecting reductions in brokered, wholesale, and municipal categories.\nProvision and Credit\nCustomers’ 2017 provision for loan losses totaled $6.8 million compared to a provision expense of $3.0 million in 2016. The 2017 provision expense included $2.3 million for loan portfolio growth and $5.6 million for specifically identified loans, offset in part by a $1.1 million release resulting from improved asset quality and lower incurred losses than previously estimated. Net charge-offs for 2017 were $6.1 million, compared to 2016 net charge-offs of $1.7 million. There were no significant changes in Customers' methodology for estimating the allowance for loan losses in 2017.\nCustomers’ Q4 2017 provision for loan losses totaled $0.8 million compared to a provision expense of $0.2 million in Q4 2016. Net charge-offs amounted to $1.1 million in Q4 2017, or 5 basis points of average loans on an annualized basis.\nRisk management is a critical component of how Customers creates long-term shareholder value, and Customers believes that two of the most important risks of banking to be understood and managed in an uncertain economy are asset quality and interest rate risk.\nCustomers believes that asset quality risks must be diligently addressed during good economic times with prudent underwriting standards so that when the economy deteriorates the bank's capital is sufficient to absorb all losses without threatening its ability to operate and serve its community and other constituents. \"Customers' non-performing loans at December 31, 2017 were only 0.30% of total loans, compared to our peer group non-performing loans of approximately 0.80% of total loans in the most recent period available, and industry average non-performing loans of 1.36% of total loans in the most recent period available. Our expectation is superior asset quality performance in good times and in difficult years,\" said Mr. Sidhu.\nNon-interest Income\nNon-interest income increased $22.5 million in 2017 to $78.9 million, a 40.0% increase over 2016. The increase mainly related to increases in interchange and card revenue of $16.8 million reflecting a full year of BankMobile Disbursements operations, an increase in gains on sales of investment securities of $8.8 million, an increase in deposit fees of $2.0 million and increased bank-owned life insurance income of $2.5 million. These increases were offset in part by the increase in other-than-temporary impairment charges of $5.7 million and decreases in mortgage warehouse transactional fees of $2.2 million.\nNon-interest income increased $4.6 million in Q4 2017 to $19.7 million, a 30.5% increase over Q4 2016. Included in Q4 2017 non-interest income was a $0.8 million increase in income from bank owned life insurance compared to Q4 2016, largely as a result of our investment in bank owned life insurance of $90.0 million made in 2017. Included in Q4 2016 non-interest income was a $7.3 million impairment charge related to Religare.\nNon-interest expense\nNon-interest expenses increased $37.4 million in 2017 from 2016, or 21.0%. The increase primarily resulted from increased BankMobile expenses of $39.2 million due to the acquisition of the Disbursements business in June 2016 compared to the full year of operations in 2017. The increase in BankMobile expenses, primarily the result of having a full year of expenses for the acquired Disbursements business, included a $10.4 million increase in salaries and employee benefits, a $20.2 million increase in technology, communication and bank operation expenses, and a $5.4 million increase in professional services. These increases in total non-interest expenses were offset in part by decreased FDIC assessments, non-income taxes and regulatory fees of $5.2 million primarily due to lower FDIC assessments. Excluding the effect of BankMobile, the Community Business Banking segment non-interest expense decreased by $1.8 million in 2017 when compared to 2016 as a result of management’s continued efforts to control expenses.\nNon-interest expenses totaled $54.8 million, an increase of $4.9 million from Q4 2016, or 9.7%. Salaries and employee benefits increased $3.4 million as Customers continues to hire new team members in the markets it serves. Technology, communication, and bank operations increased $4.8 million, largely the result of our continued investment in our BankMobile segment infrastructure. These increases were partially offset by decreases in professional services and FDIC assessments, non-income taxes and regulatory fees of $0.5 million and $0.6 million, respectively. Q4 2017 included merger-related expenses of $0.4 million related to the previously announced planned spin-off and merger of the BankMobile segment with Flagship. Excluding the effect of BankMobile, the Community Business Banking segment non-interest expenses increased by $3.8 million in Q4 2017 when compared to Q4 2016 primarily as a result of increased salaries and employee benefits of $3.0 million mainly due to salary increases and increased headcount, and increased technology, communication, and bank operations expenses of $1.6 million resulting primarily from the growth of the Bank over the past year, offset in part by reduced FDIC assessments, non-income taxes and regulatory fees of $0.6 million due to a Q4 2017 adjustment that reduced Pennsylvania shares tax expense.\nThe 2017 efficiency ratio was 61.5% compared to the 2016 efficiency ratio of 56.9%. The Q4 2017 efficiency ratio was 62.4% compared to the Q4 2016 efficiency ratio of 57.7%. The 2017 efficiency ratio for the Community Business Banking segment was 45.4% compared to the 2016 efficiency ratio of 47.8% for the segment. The Q4 2017 efficiency ratio for the Community Business Banking segment was 46.4% compared to the Q4 2016 efficiency ratio of 43.2% for the segment.\nTax\nThe provision for income tax expense for Q4 2017 was $10.8 million, resulting in an effective tax rate of 33.3%, compared to 32.0% in Q4 2016. In Q4 2017, Customers recorded a deferred tax asset re-measurement charge to its income tax expense of $5.5 million ($0.17 per diluted share) as a result of the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 in December 2017. This adjustment was offset by the tax benefit recognized in Q4 2017 of $7.3 million ($0.23 per diluted share) resulting from exercises of employee stock options and vesting of restricted stock units. Customers’ effective tax rate was 36.4% for 2017, compared to 36.8% for 2016; Customers currently estimates a 2018 effective tax rate of approximately 24%.\nProfitability\nCustomers' return on average assets was 0.77% in 2017 compared to 0.86% in 2016, and its return on average common equity was 9.38% in 2017 compared to 12.41% in 2016. The adjusted return on average assets, which excludes the notable items described above and gains on sales of investment securities (a non-GAAP measure) was 0.85% in 2017 and the adjusted return on average common equity, which excludes the notable items described above and gains on sales of securities (a non-GAAP measure) was 10.45% in 2017.\nCustomers' return on average assets was 0.84% in both Q4 2017 and Q4 2016, and its return on average common equity was 10.11% in Q4 2017 compared to 10.45% in Q4 2016.\nManaging Commercial Real Estate Concentration Risks and Providing High Net Worth Families Loans for Their Multi-Family Holdings\nCustomers' total commercial real estate (\"CRE\") loan exposures subject to regulatory concentration guidelines of $4.9 billion as of December 31, 2017 included construction loans of $97.4 million, multi-family loans of $3.6 billion, and non-owner occupied commercial real estate loans of $1.2 billion, which represent 418% of total risk-based capital on a combined basis, compared to 437% at December 31, 2016 and 469% at December 31, 2015. Customers' total CRE loan exposures were $4.4 billion at December 31, 2016 and $3.3 billion at December 31, 2015. Customers' loans subject to regulatory CRE concentration guidelines had 3 year cumulative growth of 88% in 2017, a deceleration from 222% in 2016.\nRecognizing the risks that accompany certain elements of commercial real estate lending, Customers has as part of its core strategies studiously sought to limit its risks and has concluded that it has appropriate risk management systems in place to manage this portfolio. Customers' total real estate construction and development exposure, arguably the riskiest area of CRE, was only $97.4 million at December 31, 2017, less than 10% of total risk-based capital.\nCustomers' loans collateralized by multi-family properties were approximately 311% of total risk-based capital at December 31, 2017. Customers' multi-family exposures are focused principally on loans to high net worth families collateralized by multi-family properties that are of modest size and subject to what Customers believes are conservative underwriting standards. Customers believes it has a strong risk management process to manage the portfolio risks prospectively and that this portfolio will perform well even under a stressed scenario. Following are some key characteristics of Customers' multi-family loan portfolio:\nPrincipally concentrated in New York City with an emphasis on properties subject to some type of rent control; and principally to high net worth families; Average loan size is $6.9 million; Median annual debt service coverage ratio is 137%; Median loan-to-value at origination is 67.33%; All loans are individually stressed with an increase of 1% and 2% to the cap rate and an increase of 1.5% and 3% in loan interest rates; All properties are inspected prior to a loan being granted and monitored thereafter on an annual basis by dedicated portfolio managers; and Credit approval process is independent of customer sales and portfolio management process.\nConference Call Date: Thursday, January 25, 2018 Time: 9:00 AM ET US Dial-in: 800-967-7154 International Dial-in: 719-457-1510 Participant Code: 874082 Please dial in at least 10 minutes before the start of the call to ensure timely participation.
