But prosecutors say funds were illegally diverted to bank accounts of people including Atul Gupta, a wealthy businessman. \nAtul Gupta, as well as his brothers Ajay and Rajesh, is a friend of Zuma. The South African government has launched a judicial enquiry into allegations the brothers influenced the appointment of cabinet ministers. \nZuma and the Guptas have denied wrongdoing. \nAs part of the investigation into the dairy, prosecutors have obtained a court order freezing 220 million rand (£13 million) in bank accounts, a spokesman for the state prosecutors’ office said. Atul Gupta was mentioned in the court order as having received the proceeds of crime. \nThe investigation could have important political repercussions, as it could lead to Magashule losing his job as ANC secretary general, a post that puts him in charge of the day-to-day running of the ruling party. \nRamaphosa did not want Magashule to be chosen as secretary general in December. Should Magashule end up in legal trouble over the dairy project, Ramaphosa could try to replace him with a loyalist. \nMagashule said earlier this week that no person was guilty until proven in the courts. \n“Wherever there is corruption, the law must take its course. ... We will treat the Vrede dairy in that way,” he told reporters. An ANC spokeswoman was not immediately available for further comment on Friday. \nThe Hawks spokesman said the investigation into the Estina dairy was at an advanced stage.
