The township has a population of 370,000 people. \nStreet vending and public gatherings have been banned in Lusaka to prevent the spread of cholera but the residents of Kanyama have been defying this order in the evenings after soldiers deployed to clean the streets have left. \n“Kanyama has recorded the highest number of fatalities because of the poor compliance with interventions that have been put in place,” Chilufya said. \nThe cholera outbreak was initially linked to contaminated water from shallow wells, but investigations indicated that contaminated food was the main culprit. \nZambia last week shut three of South African retailer Shoprite’s Hungry Lion fast-food restaurants after their food tested positive for the bacterium that causes cholera. \nHungry Lion said on Saturday that the restaurants had been closed for disinfection and it hoped that the government would soon allow them to reopen. \nPresident Edgar Lungu on Dec. 30 directed the military to help to fight the spread of the waterborne disease. \nCholera causes acute watery diarrhoea. It can be treated with oral hydration solutions and antibiotics but spreads rapidly and can kill within hours if not treated.
