That’ll be up to him,” Bayliss told the BBC. \nThe schedule will now have to be re-examined. \nStokes was left out of the party for this winter’s Ashes series after being suspended from playing for his country as police decided whether to press charges following an incident outside a Bristol nightclub last September. \nThe 26-year-old is accused of affray alongside two other men. \nStokes’ recall has received a mixed reception in England, with some observers questioning why he has been allowed to return when facing charges. \nAfter England’s tri-nation series, they remain in New Zealand to play five ODIs and two Tests against New Zealand.
