(“PMAR”), a wholly owned non-bank subsidiary, today reported its financial results for the three months and year ended December 31, 2017.\nFor the fourth quarter of 2017, the Company reported net income of $2.4 million, or $0.10 per share. This compares with net income of $3.8 million, or $0.16 per share, in the third quarter of 2017, and net income of $309 thousand, or $0.01 per share, in the fourth quarter of 2016. The decrease in net income, as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2017, is primarily attributable to a decrease in net interest income and an increase in noninterest expense. The decrease in net interest income is a result of a higher level of interest income in the quarter ended September 30, 2017 attributable to the recovery of $1.1 million in interest income on a single loan relationship that had been on nonaccrual status but was paid in full during the third quarter. The increase in noninterest expense is primarily related to increases in our accounting and legal fees.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017, the Company reported net income of $10.4 million, or $0.45 per share. This compares with a net loss of $34.6 million, or $(1.51) per share, for the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase in net income is primarily the result of an $8.2 million increase in net interest income, resulting from our $118.1 million increase in gross loans for the year and an increase of $1.4 million in our noninterest income as a result of an increase in our service and loan related fees. Additionally, our net income increased as a result of no provision for loan and lease losses in 2017 as compared to a provision of $19.9 million during 2016, resulting from an improvement in our asset quality, and an income tax benefit of $91 thousand for the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to an income tax provision of $16.8 million during the same period in 2016 related to the establishment of a full valuation allowance on our deferred tax asset in the prior year.\nCommenting on the results, Tom Vertin, President & CEO of Pacific Mercantile Bancorp, said, “We are very pleased with the progress we made on our strategic priorities in 2017, which resulted in strong commercial loan growth, an expanded net interest margin, a higher level of efficiencies, and improved asset quality. The positive trends we saw across the Company drove a significant increase in our level of profitability over the prior year. We anticipate another year of strong commercial loan growth in 2018, although we expect it will be partially offset by the continued runoff of real estate loans. In addition to continuing to attract new operating companies to the Bank and further improving efficiencies, we will be highly focused on drawing in new clients that have primarily depository needs. We believe that improving our deposit mix and lowering our cost of funds will have a positive impact on continued earnings growth.”\nResults of Operations\nThe following table shows our operating results for the three months and year ended December 31, 2017, as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2017 and the three months and year ended December 31, 2016. The discussion below highlights the key factors contributing to the changes shown in the following table.\nThree Months Ended Year Ended December 31, December 31,\n2017 September 30,\n2017 December 31,\n2016 2017 2016 ($ in thousands) Total interest income $ 13,812 $ 14,025 $ 10,612 $ 51,573 $ 41,000 Total interest expense 2,542 2,020 1,462 7,831 5,477 Net interest income 11,270 12,005 9,150 43,742 35,523 Provision for loan and lease losses — — — — 19,870 Total noninterest income 1,009 964 265 4,374 2,937 Total noninterest expense 10,108 9,176 9,265 37,758 36,401 Income tax provision (241 ) 37 (159 ) (91 ) 16,832 Net income (loss) $ 2,412 $ 3,756 $ 309 $ 10,449 $ (34,643 ) Net Interest Income\nQ4 2017 vs Q3 2017. Net interest income decreased $735 thousand, or 6.1%, for the three months ended December 31, 2017 as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2017 primarily as a result of:\nA decrease in interest income of $213 thousand, or 1.5%, primarily attributable to the recovery of $1.1 million in interest income on a single loan relationship that had been on nonaccrual status but was paid in full during the third quarter, partially offset by an increase in interest earned on loans and short-term investments as a result of higher average balances and an increase in the average yields during the three months ended December 31, 2017 as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2017, which was primarily the result of the rising interest rate environment; and An increase in interest expense of $522 thousand, or 25.8%, primarily attributable to an increase in the volume of and rates of interest paid on our deposits and other borrowings for the three months ended December 31, 2017 as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2017, which was primarily the result of new client acquisition, our decision to increase the rate of interest paid on our certificates of deposit resulting from the rising interest rate environment, and an increase in our Federal Home Loan Bank (“FHLB”) borrowings.\nOur net interest margin decreased to 3.63% for the three months ended December 31, 2017 as compared to 4.06% for the three months ended September 30, 2017 primarily as a result of the recovery of $1.1 million in interest income on a single loan relationship that had been on nonaccrual status but was paid in full during the third quarter, partially offset by a favorable shift in the mix of interest-earning assets for the three months ended December 31, 2017 as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2017.\nQ4 2017 vs Q4 2016. Net interest income increased $2.1 million, or 23.2%, for the three months ended December 31, 2017 as compared to the three months ended December 31, 2016 primarily as a result of:\nAn increase in interest income of $3.2 million, or 30.2%, primarily attributable to an increase in interest earned on loans as a result of a higher average balance and an increase in the average yield on loans for the three months ended December 31, 2017 as compared to the three months ended December 31, 2016, which was primarily the result of the rising interest rate environment; partially offset by An increase in interest expense of $1.1 million, or 73.9%, primarily attributable to an increase in the volume of and rates of interest paid on, our deposits for the three months ended December 31, 2017 as compared to the three months ended December 31, 2016, which was primarily the result of new client acquisition, our decision to increase the rate of interest paid on our certificates of deposit resulting from the rising interest rate environment, and an increase in our FHLB borrowings.\n2017 vs 2016. Net interest income increased $8.2 million, or 23.1%, for the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2016, primarily as a result of:\nAn increase in interest income of $10.6 million, or 25.8%, primarily attributable to an increase in interest earned on loans as a result of a higher average loan balance and an increase in the average yield on loans for the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2016, which was primarily the result of the rising interest rate environment, and the recovery of $1.1 million in interest income on a single loan relationship that had been on nonaccrual status but was paid in full during the third quarter of 2017; partially offset by An increase in interest expense of $2.4 million, or 43.0%, primarily attributable to an increase in the volume of and rates of interest paid on our deposits for the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2016, which was primarily the result of new client acquisition, our decision to increase the rate of interest paid on our certificates of deposit resulting from the rising interest rate environment, and an increase in our FHLB borrowings.\nProvision for Loan and Lease Losses\nQ4 2017 vs Q3 2017. We recorded no provision for loan and lease losses during either the three months ended December 31, 2017 or September 30, 2017 due primarily to reserves for new loans being offset by a decline in the level of classified assets. During the three months ended December 31, 2017, we had net charge-offs of $852 thousand, compared with net charge-offs of $2.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2017.\nQ4 2017 vs Q4 2016. We recorded no provision for loan and lease losses during either the three months ended December 31, 2017 or December 31, 2016. There was no provision for the fourth quarter of 2017 due primarily to reserves for new loan growth being offset by a decline in the level of classified assets. There was no provision for loan and lease losses in the fourth quarter of 2016 due primarily to reserves for new loan growth being offset by improvement in asset quality.\n2017 vs 2016. We recorded no provision for loan and lease losses during the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to a provision for loan and lease losses of $19.9 million recorded during the year ended December 31, 2016. We recorded no provision for loan and lease losses during the year ended December 31, 2017 due primarily to reserves for new loan growth being offset by a decline in the level of classified assets. We recorded a provision for loan and lease losses of $19.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 primarily as a result of new loan growth and downgrades and charge-offs on several loans that exceeded recoveries during the year ended December 31, 2016.\nNoninterest Income\nQ4 2017 vs Q3 2017. Noninterest income increased $45 thousand, or 4.7%, for the three months ended December 31, 2017 as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2017, resulting from an increase in our loan servicing fees during the fourth quarter of 2017.\nQ4 2017 vs Q4 2016. Noninterest income increased by $744 thousand, or 280.8%, for the three months ended December 31, 2017 as compared to the three months ended December 31, 2016, primarily as a result of:\nA loss of $24 thousand on the sale of other assets in the fourth quarter of 2017 as compared to a loss of $527 thousand during the same period in 2016; and An increase in loan servicing and referral fees during the fourth quarter of 2017.\n2017 vs 2016. Noninterest income increased $1.4 million, or 48.9%, for the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2016, primarily as a result of:\nAn increase in loan servicing and referral fees during the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to the same period in 2016; and A loss of $37 thousand on the sale of other assets during the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to a loss of $527 thousand during the same period in 2016; partially offset by A decrease of $40 thousand in net gain on sale of small business administration loans for the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to the same period in 2016.\nNoninterest Expense\nQ4 2017 vs Q3 2017. Noninterest expense increased $932 thousand, or 10.2%, for the three months ended December 31, 2017 as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2017, primarily as a result of:\nAn increase of $267 thousand in our loan-related expenses as a result of the reversal of our mortgage repurchase reserve during the three months ended September 30, 2017; An increase of $275 thousand in our professional fees attributable to an increase in accounting and legal fees during the fourth quarter of 2017; and An increase in various expense accounts related to the normal course of operating, including expenses related to business development and data processing.\nQ4 2017 vs Q4 2016. Noninterest expense increased $843 thousand, or 9.1%, for the three months ended December 31, 2017 as compared to the three months ended December 31, 2016, primarily as a result of:\nAn increase of $910 thousand in salaries and employee benefits primarily related to our incentive compensation accrual for the fourth quarter of 2017 and the reversal of our incentive compensation accrual during the fourth quarter of 2016; and An increase in various expense accounts related to the normal course of operating, including expenses related to business development and data processing; partially offset by A decrease of $378 thousand in our professional fees primarily related to lower legal fees in 2017.\n2017 vs 2016. Noninterest expense increased $1.4 million, or 3.7%, for the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2016, primarily as a result of:\nAn increase of $1.2 million in salaries and employee benefits primarily related to our incentive compensation accrual for the current year and the reversal of our incentive compensation accrual during the fourth quarter of 2016 for the prior year; and An increase of $169 thousand in our professional fees attributable to an increase in accounting and legal fees during the year ended December 31, 2017.\nIncome tax provision (benefit)\nFor the three months and year ended December 31, 2017, we had an income tax benefit of $241 thousand and $91 thousand, respectively. The income tax benefit for the three months and year ended December 31, 2017 represents the reclassification of the alternative minimum tax credit carryforward from a deferred tax asset to an income tax receivable as required by the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act signed into law on December 22, 2017. This was partially offset by the payment to the State of California for the cost of doing business within the state. No additional income tax expense was recorded as a result of our full valuation allowance, discussed further below. The fourth quarter of 2017 and year ended December 31, 2017 results reflect the estimated impact of the enactment of the new tax law, which resulted in a minimal increase in net income due to the elimination of the corporate alternative minimum tax. Additionally, as part of the newly enacted tax law, the decrease in our deferred tax asset and corresponding valuation allowance as of December 31, 2017 is primarily attributable to the Federal corporate tax rate decreasing from 35% to 21%, which caused us to decrease our gross deferred tax asset and the related valuation allowance to $15.9 million from $21.7 million as of September 30, 2017. Accounting rules specify that management must evaluate the deferred tax asset on a recurring basis to determine whether enough positive evidence exists to determine whether it is more-likely-than-not that the deferred tax asset will be available to offset or reduce future taxes. The tax code allows net operating losses to be carried forward for 20 years from the date of the loss, and while management believes that the Company will be able to realize the deferred tax asset within the period that our net operating losses may be carried forward, we are unable to assert the timing as to when that realization will occur. Due to the hierarchy of evidence that the accounting rules specify, management determined that a full valuation allowance that was previously established on the balance of our deferred tax asset was still required at December 31, 2017.\nFor the three months and year ended December 31, 2016, we had income tax benefit of $159 thousand and income tax expense of $16.8 million, respectively. The income tax benefit for the three months ended December 31, 2016 represents a true up related to a prior year intraperiod tax allocation that was adjusted in the fourth quarter of 2016 to our actual income tax expense. The income tax expense for the year ended December 31, 2016 was a result of the Company's net loss during the year and the establishment of a full valuation allowance during 2016 on the balance of our deferred tax asset, which includes current and historical losses that may be used to offset taxes on future profits. Negative evidence included the significant losses incurred during the second and third quarters of 2016, an increase in our nonperforming assets from December 31, 2015 to December 31, 2016, a cumulative three-year loss position, and our accumulated deficit. Positive evidence included our forecast of our taxable income, the time period in which we have to utilize our deferred tax asset and the current economic conditions. While management believed that the Company would be able to realize the deferred tax asset within the period that our net operating losses may be carried forward, we were unable to assert the timing as to when that realization would occur. As a result of this conclusion and due to the hierarchy of evidence that the accounting rules specify, a valuation allowance was recorded as of December 31, 2016 to offset the deferred tax asset.\nBalance Sheet Information\nLoans\nAs indicated in the table below, at December 31, 2017, gross loans totaled approximately $1.1 billion, which represented an increase of $24.6 million, or 2.4%, compared to gross loans outstanding at September 30, 2017, and an increase of $118.1 million, or 12.5%, compared to gross loans outstanding at December 31, 2016. The following table sets forth the composition, by loan category, of our loan portfolio at December 31, 2017, September 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016.\nDecember 31, 2017 September 30, 2017 December 31, 2016 Amount Percent of\nTotal Loans Amount Percent of\nTotal Loans Amount Percent of\nTotal Loans ($ in thousands) Commercial loans $ 394,493 37.1% $ 364,242 35.0% $ 333,376 35.2% Commercial real estate loans - owner occupied 214,365 20.1% 211,514 20.3% 214,420 22.7% Commercial real estate loans - all other 228,090 21.4% 235,319 22.6% 173,223 18.3% Residential mortgage loans - multi-family 114,302 10.7% 123,698 11.9% 130,930 13.8% Residential mortgage loans - single family 24,848 2.3% 27,983 2.7% 34,527 3.6% Construction and land development loans 34,614 3.3% 28,461 2.7% 18,485 2.0% Consumer loans 53,918 5.1% 48,801 4.7% 41,563 4.4% Gross loans $ 1,064,630 100.0% $ 1,040,018 100.0% $ 946,524 100.0% The increase of $24.6 million in gross loans during the fourth quarter of 2017 was primarily a result of new loan growth and client acquisition. During the fourth quarter of 2017, we secured new commercial loan commitments of $60.1 million, of which $46.5 million were funded at December 31, 2017. Our total commercial loan commitments increased to $623.5 million at December 31, 2017 from $614.1 million at September 30, 2017, while the utilization rate of commercial commitments increased to 63.2% at December 31, 2017 from 59.4% at September 30, 2017.\nDeposits\nDecember 31, 2017 September 30, 2017 December 31, 2016 Type of Deposit ($ in thousands) Noninterest-bearing checking accounts $ 338,273 $ 320,248 $ 332,573 Interest-bearing checking accounts 89,179 92,467 75,366 Money market and savings deposits 350,605 314,002 335,453 Certificates of deposit 361,336 327,803 257,908 Totals $ 1,139,393 $ 1,054,520 $ 1,001,300 The increase in our total deposits from September 30, 2017 to December 31, 2017 is primarily attributable to an increase of $14.7 million in our checking accounts, an increase of $36.6 million in money market and savings deposits, and an increase of $33.5 million in our certificates of deposit. The increase in our core deposits is primarily the result of new client acquisition. The increase in our certificates of deposit is primarily the result of our decision to increase the rate of interest paid on our certificates of deposit due to the rising interest rate environment. Lower priced core deposits decreased to 68% of total deposits, while higher priced certificates of deposit increased to 32% of total deposits at December 31, 2017, as compared to 69% and 31% of total deposits, respectively, at September 30, 2017.\nAsset Quality\nNonperforming Assets\n2017 2016 December 31 September 30 June 30 March 31 December 31 ($ in thousands) Total non-performing loans $ 5,910 $ 10,279 $ 22,393 $ 25,659 $ 24,897 Other non-performing assets 36 95 181 58 — Total non-performing assets $ 5,946 $ 10,374 $ 22,574 $ 25,717 $ 24,897 90-day past due loans $ 2,125 $ 2,212 $ 12,261 $ 15,838 $ 14,949 Total classified assets $ 12,925 $ 19,116 $ 31,623 $ 37,114 $ 53,901 Allowance for loan and lease losses $ 14,196 $ 15,048 $ 17,178 $ 16,794 $ 16,801 Allowance for loan and lease losses /gross loans 1.33 % 1.45 % 1.65 % 1.77 % 1.78 % Allowance for loan and lease losses /total assets 1.07 % 1.25 % 1.42 % 1.42 % 1.47 % Ratio of allowance for loan and lease losses to nonperforming loans 240.20 % 146.40 % 76.71 % 65.45 % 67.48 % Ratio of nonperforming assets to total assets 0.45 % 0.86 % 1.86 % 2.18 % 2.18 % Net quarterly charge-offs (recoveries) to gross loans 0.08 % 0.20 % (0.04 )% — % (0.02 )% Nonperforming assets at December 31, 2017 decreased $4.4 million from September 30, 2017 primarily as a result of a decrease in non-performing loans in the fourth quarter of 2017. The decrease in our non-performing loans resulted primarily from $332 thousand of payoffs or paydowns on our nonaccrual loans, upgrades of $3.3 million, charge-offs of $1.6 million, and the transfer of $58 thousand to other foreclosed assets, partially offset by the addition of three new loan relationships totaling $869 thousand during the three months ended December 31, 2017.\nOur classified assets decreased by $6.2 million from $19.1 million at September 30, 2017 to $12.9 million at December 31, 2017. The decrease is primarily related to principal payments of $806 thousand, upgrades of $3.6 million, charge-offs of $1.5 million, and the sale of our collateralized mortgage obligations of $382 thousand during the three months ended December 31, 2017, partially offset by $78 thousand of additions during the same period.\nAllowance for loan and lease losses\n2017 2016 December 31 September 30 June 30 March 31 December 31 ($ in thousands) Balance at beginning of quarter $ 15,048 $ 17,178 $ 16,794 $ 16,801 $ 16,642 Charge offs (1,449 ) (2,275 ) (556 ) (456 ) (113 ) Recoveries 597 145 940 449 272 Provision — — — — — Balance at end of quarter $ 14,196 $ 15,048 $ 17,178 $ 16,794 $ 16,801 At December 31, 2017, the allowance for loan and lease losses (“ALLL”) totaled $14.2 million, which was approximately $852 thousand less than at September 30, 2017 and $2.6 million less than at December 31, 2016. The ALLL activity during the three months ended December 31, 2017 included net charge-offs of $852 thousand. There was no provision for loan and lease losses during the period, primarily attributable to reserves for new loans being offset by a decline in classified assets. Of the $1.4 million in gross charge-offs during the three months ended December 31, 2017, $1.0 million related to one loan relationship that was previously on nonaccrual status. The ratio of the ALLL-to-total loans outstanding as of December 31, 2017 was 1.33% as compared to 1.45% and 1.78% as of September 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016, respectively.\nCapital Resources\nAt December 31, 2017, we had total regulatory capital on a consolidated basis of $147.6 million, and the Bank had total regulatory capital of $137.6 million. The ratio of the Bank’s total capital-to-risk weighted assets, which is the principal federal bank regulatory measure of the financial strength of banking institutions, was 11.6% and, as a result, the Bank continued to be classified, under federal bank regulatory guidelines, as a “well-capitalized” banking institution, which is the highest of the capital standards established by federal banking regulatory authorities.\nThe following table sets forth the regulatory capital and capital ratios of the Company (on a consolidated basis) and the Bank (on a stand-alone basis) at December 31, 2017, as compared to the regulatory requirements that must be met for a banking institution to be rated as a well-capitalized institution.\nActual\nAt December 31, 2017 Federal Regulatory Requirement\nto be Rated Well-Capitalized Amount Ratio Amount Ratio ($ in thousands) Total Capital to Risk Weighted Assets: Company $ 147,551 12.4 % N/A N/A Bank 137,581 11.6 % $ 118,664 At least 10.0 Common Equity Tier 1 Capital to Risk Weighted Assets: Company $ 116,005 9.8 % N/A N/A Bank 123,035 10.4 % $ 77,132 At least 6.5 Tier 1 Capital to Risk Weighted Assets: Company $ 133,005 11.2 % N/A N/A Bank 123,035 10.4 % $ 94,931 At least 8.0 Tier 1 Capital to Average Assets: Company $ 133,005 10.7 % N/A N/A Bank 123,035 9.9 % $ 62,251 At least 5.0 About Pacific Mercantile Bancorp\nPacific Mercantile Bancorp (NASDAQ:PMBC) is the parent holding company of Pacific Mercantile Bank, which opened for business March 1, 1999.

Those statements, which include the quotation from management, constitute “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, can be identified by the fact that they do not relate strictly to historical or current facts. Often, they include words such as “believe,” “expect,” “anticipate,” “intend,” “plan,” “estimate,” “project,” or words of similar meaning, or future or conditional verbs such as “will,” “would,” “should,” “could,” or “may.” Forward-looking statements are based on current information available to us and our assumptions about future events over which we do not have control. Moreover, our business and our markets are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties which could cause our actual financial performance in the future, and the future performance of our markets (which can affect both our financial performance and the market prices of our shares), to differ, possibly materially, from our expectations as set forth in the forward-looking statements contained in this news release.\nIn addition to the risk of incurring loan losses and provision for loan losses, which is an inherent risk of the banking business, these risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, the following: the risk that the credit quality of our borrowers declines; potential declines in the value of the collateral for secured loans; the risk that steps we have taken to strengthen our overall credit administration are not effective; the risk of a downturn in the United States economy, and domestic or international economic conditions, which could cause us to incur additional loan losses and adversely affect our results of operations in the future; the risk that our interest margins and, therefore, our net interest income will be adversely affected by changes in prevailing interest rates; the risk that we will not succeed in further reducing our remaining nonperforming assets, in which event we would face the prospect of further loan charge-offs and write-downs of assets; the risk that we will not be able to manage our interest rate risks effectively, in which event our operating results could be harmed; the prospect of changes in government regulation of banking and other financial services organizations, which could impact our costs of doing business and restrict our ability to take advantage of business and growth opportunities; the risk that our efforts to develop a robust commercial banking platform may not succeed; and the risk that we may be unable to realize our expected level of increasing deposit inflows. Readers of this news release are encouraged to review the additional information regarding these and other risks and uncertainties to which our business is subject that is contained in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2016, which is on file with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) and will be set forth in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017, which we expect to file with the SEC during the first quarter of 2018.\nDue to these and other risks and uncertainties to which our business is subject, you are cautioned not to place undue reliance on the forward-looking statements contained in this news release, which speak only as of its date, or to make predictions about our future financial performance based solely on our historical financial performance. We disclaim any obligation to update or revise any of the forward-looking statements as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, except as may be required by law.\nCONSOLIDATED
