It would open up 90% of offshore land for drilling as part of a five-year plan. It reverses an Obama-era plan that would have kept only 6% of the same acres available for drilling. \n“We’re going to become the strongest energy super power,” Zinke said in a call with reporters. “We certainly have the assets to do that.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-04T21:02:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-04T21:07:05.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
