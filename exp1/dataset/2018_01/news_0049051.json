In case of default, Elliott could take over the club. \nEarlier this month AC Milanâ€™s CEO Marco Fassone said he hoped to wrap up a refinancing deal by April. \nAC Milan did not immediately respond to a request for comment. \n($1 = 0.8085 euros)", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-29T16:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-29T16:10:59.001+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
