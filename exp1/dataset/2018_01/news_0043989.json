They’d been away from that market for three years and one of their concerns was that they weren’t going to be able to get a US$3bn size,” said a banker away.\n“They did three €5bn last year for the first time ever, they did more euros than anything else put together last year and if they’d done a US$2bn 10-year when they can do €5bn, it would have looked pretty bad. They need both markets to look good.” (Reporting by Helene Durand; Editing by Philip Wright)\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-01-25T01:20:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-25T13:20:06.026+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
