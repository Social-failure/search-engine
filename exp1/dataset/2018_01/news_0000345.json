It’s taking a few matches to play like 100 percent but I still felt I played pretty well today.”\nTop seed Wozniacki started brightly with a break of serve to love on her way to an early 3-0 lead and added another break in the eighth game to wrap up the opening set in just 24 minutes on a glorious day in New Zealand’s largest city.\nMartic tried to mount a comeback early in the second when she broke for a 2-0 lead but Wozniacki won the final six games behind impressive serving numbers, including six aces, to book a last eight encounter with young American Sofia Kenin.\n“I’ve worked on everything I need to work on in the off-season,” Wozniacki added as she continues her preparations for the Australian Open starting in Melbourne on Jan. 15.\nFILE PHOTO - Tennis - WTA Tour Finals - Singapore Indoor Stadium, Singapore - October 29, 2017 Denmark's Caroline Wozniacki in action during the final against USA's Venus Williams REUTERS/Edgar Su “Now it’s just a matter of working out how to incorporate that into your match or into a situation where you maybe get nervous.”\nKenin, a 19-year-old wild card, knocked out compatriot Varvara Lepchenko 6-4 7-6(6) earlier in the day and there were also victories for Taiwan’s Hsieh Su-wei and Barbora Strycova.\nHsieh recorded a 6-4 6-3 triumph over Belgian qualifier Ysaline Bonaventure to set up a quarter-final clash against Strycova after the third seeded Czech edged out Sweden’s Johanna Larsson 6-1 6-7(3) 6-2.\nIn the late matches, second seeded German Julia Goerges eased to a 6-4 6-0 victory over Slovakia’s Viktoria Kuzmova to book a last eight tie against Slovenia’s Polona Hercog, who was almost as ruthless in a 6-4 6-2 win over Kirsten Flipkens.\nFormer world number two Agnieszka Radwanska continued her strong start to the campaign with a 6-3 7-5 win over American Taylor Townsend, the Pole holding her nerve in a tight second set that lasted more than an hour to advance.\nFourth seed Radwanska, who remains on a collision course for a semi-final against Wozniacki, next faces American qualifier Sachia Vickery, who defeated Paraguay’s Veronica Cepede Royg 6-2 6-4.\nReporting by John O'Brien in Singapore; Editing by Greg Stutchbury/Amlan Chakraborty\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-03T07:03:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-03T07:18:36.018+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
