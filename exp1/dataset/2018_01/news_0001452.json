While the team began training in freestyle soccer - a non-competitive art where players perform tricks with a ball - they soon decided to aim higher. \n“I started bringing the people in and coach Yousry, the team coach, called me to start training me on freestyle football,” team captain Mahmoud Ibrahim Tawfik, who lost a leg in a road accident more than 20 years ago, told Reuters. \n“I told him I have another dream of becoming a real life soccer player not just a freestyle footballer who has skills.” FILE PHOTO: Members of \"Miracle Team\", a soccer team made up of one-legged, crutch-bearing soccer players, listen to their coach before a training session at El Salam club on the outskirts of Cairo, Egypt December 29, 2017.

Crutches are not allowed to touch the ball and there is no offside rule or limits to substitutions. \nThere are 42 nations who now have national amputee football federations, according to the World Amputee Football Federation. The next amputee football World Cup is being held in Mexico later this year.
