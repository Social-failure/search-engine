It's a great skill to have.\"\nTo bone up on these skills, he recommends taking computer science and accounting classes in school or online, and applying it to everyday problems and your job.\nSee also: \nBank of America CEO: People with this skill will be successful in the future job market \nBillionaire Ray Dalio shares his best career advice for 20-somethings \nshow chapters Kevin Durant took a nearly $10 million pay cut — here's why      12:03 PM ET Wed, 12 July 2017 | 01:00", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-25T19:53:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-25T20:07:42.012+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
