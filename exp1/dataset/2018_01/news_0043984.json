The motive for the bugging devices and break-in were not yet known, according to the FPO-run interior ministry. \nThe revelations coincided with a scandal involving the Freedom Party’s leadership candidate, Udo Landbauer, in elections in the province of Lower Austria. Landbauer suspended his membership of a student fraternity he helped lead when it emerged the group had distributed song books with Nazi content. \nThe Freedom Party (FPO), junior coalition partner to Chancellor Sebastian Kurz’s conservatives, was founded by former Nazis in the 1950s and has repeatedly kicked out members for neo-Nazi or anti-Semitic sentiments. \nThe FPO says it has left its Nazi past behind. \nAustria’s main Jewish community body (IKG) said earlier on Thursday that it would boycott a parliamentary Holocaust commemoration event because of the FPO’s presence in government. \nOn Friday, thousands of people were expected to stage a protest against a far right ball hosted by the FPO in Vienna’s imperial-era Hofburg Palace. \nThe coalition deal handed control of much of Austria’s security apparatus to the FPO, which came third in October’s parliamentary election with 26 percent of the vote.
