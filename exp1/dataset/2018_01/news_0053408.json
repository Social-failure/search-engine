Many companies are shunning the fuel because of its carbon-intensity, but the mining industry says the developing world still needs it.\nMining coal in South Africa is complicated by a dispute with the government and the industry over a new mining code and by turmoil at indebted power utility Eskom.\n“The sale delivers on our long-standing strategy to exit our Eskom-tied coal assets,” Norman Mbazima, deputy chairman of Anglo American South Africa, said in a statement.\nNew Largo’s main asset is an 585 million tonne coal resource and related mining rights, which is positioned to supply Eskom’s new Kusile Power Station, the statement said.\nNew Largo Coal Proprietary Limited is owned by Seriti Resources Proprietary Limited and Coalzar Proprietary Limited, two companies majority owned and controlled by historically disadvantaged South Africans.\nThe deal is subject to regulatory approval and expected to close in the second half of 2018.\nAnglo American’s share price rose around 1.5 pct by 0845 GMT, slightly above the broader market.\nPaul Gait, analyst at Bernstein, said he liked the deal, carried out in a supportive coal price environment.\nIt was a “a tail asset that does not form part of the Anglo investment case for most shareholders,” he said.\nAnother South African player South32, the company spun out of BHP, has said it will run its South Africa Energy Coal business as a standalone unit and is expected to either float it on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange or to sell it.\nReporting by Barbara Lewis; editing by Jason Neely and Louise Heavens\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-01-29T15:33:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-29T15:03:32.008+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
