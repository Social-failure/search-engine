He is one of the CFPB’s most vociferous critics.\nThe position was last filled by Leandra English, who is now the agency’s deputy director. English had been a top deputy of former Director Richard Cordray, who resigned in November and contended English should take over the agency. She sued the administration in November, claiming that Cordray had legal grounds to name his successor until a full-time director was named by Trump and confirmed by the Senate.\nMick Mulvaney, President Donald Trump’s budget director who is CFPB acting director, has vowed to move the agency away from its agenda under President Barack Obama.\nThe financial industry has long complained the CFPB was too aggressive in its rulewriting and enforcement, and that its single director enjoyed too much power. But consumer advocates have called it a critical safeguard for Americans.\nAlso on Friday, Hensarling said that Shannon McGahn would return to the Financial Services Committee to fill the staff director role. McGahn most recently was a top advisor to Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin.\nReporting by Pete Schroeder; Editing by Richard Chang\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-01-06T03:48:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-05T22:22:47.009+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
