He also took home a Golden Globe and numerous trophies from film critics groups. \nThe win came despite 2010 sexual harassment accusations that resurfaced in the run-up to the ceremony. Two lawsuits alleging unwanted advances were filed by female crew members on another movie and were settled out of court for undisclosed sums.

He was first nominated for an Oscar in 2008 for his lead role in “The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford.” 89th Academy Awards - Oscars Backstage - Hollywood, California, U.S. - 26/02/17 – Casey Affleck, winner of Best Actor for Manchester by the Sea, holds his oscar.
