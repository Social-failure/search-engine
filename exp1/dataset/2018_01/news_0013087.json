This is kind of unheard of for a movie this size.\"\nIn second place is the horror film \"Insidious: The Last Key,\" the fourth in the franchise, which earned $29.3 million. The Universal and Blumhouse Pictures film even outperformed the third chapter in the series. That film launched to $22.7 million in June of 2015.\n\"We could not be more thrilled with that debut. It's a fantastic result,\" said Jim Orr, Universal's president of domestic distribution. \"The release date worked in our favor. There hasn't been a similar film in a couple of months. \"\nYoung audiences drove the \"Insidious\" box office with 59 percent under the age of 25. Whether or not they enjoyed the film is another question: It got a scary B- CinemaScore.\n\"Star Wars: The Last Jedi\" fell to third place with $23.6 million in its fourth weekend in theaters. The space blockbuster has grossed $572.5 million to date.\n\"The Greatest Showman\" took fourth place with $13.8 million and \"Pitch Perfect 3\" rounded out the top five with $10.2 million.\nAwards seasons films continue to expand throughout January, too, like Aaron Sorkin's directorial debut \"Molly's Game,\" which added over 1,300 theaters this weekend and took in $7 million. The Jessica Chastain-starrer about the real life \"poker princess\" Molly Bloom is up for two Golden Globe awards Sunday evening — best actress and best screenplay.\nThe Winston Churchill film \"Darkest Hour\" starring Gary Oldman (who is up for a best actor Golden Globe) also added 790 theaters and took in $6.4 million.\nThe weekend is up around 18 percent from the same weekend last year, which Dergarabedian sees as a sign that perhaps the 2018 box office will be stronger and more steady than 2017.\n\"2017 was not consistent. It was volatile, it was a rollercoaster,\" Dergarabedian said. \"This sets the tone for what we're hoping is a consistent and strong 2018 box office.\"\nEstimated ticket sales for Friday through Sunday at U.S. and Canadian theaters, according to comScore.
