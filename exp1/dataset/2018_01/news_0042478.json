Not only are tech companies scrambling to hire data scientists, but industries across the board, from health care to nonprofits to retail, are also searching for this talent.\" \nIndeed, many of the jobs in the top 10 are available in a number of industries. \n\"A key trend we see for these best jobs is that many of these roles are also ones that can be found in almost every industry — from data scientists to HR managers to executive assistants,\" explains Chamberlain. \"This is encouraging for people with these skills, as there is a wide range of career opportunities to consider.\" \nLike this story?
