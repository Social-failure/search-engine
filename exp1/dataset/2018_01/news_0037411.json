Jeff Flake , Susan Collins and Lindsey Graham told reporters they were optimistic that a deal was close on several issues. However, Collins, added that it would be \"helpful\" in swaying Democrats if McConnell's language were firmer on a DACA vote assurance.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-22T17:11:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-22T17:29:30.010+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
