The pickup in growth has been broad based, with \"notable upside surprises\" in Europe and Asia.\nRisks and reforms Check out the world leaders and celebrities who are going to Davos this year Larry Busacca | Getty Images Entertainment | Getty Images This year, the IMF's midterm economic outlook has coincided with the World Economic Forum (WEF) in Davos, Switzerland, the annual meeting that attracts around 3,000 participants, from world leaders and business heads to public and private policymakers.\nThe annual meeting aims to \"improve the state of the world\" and encourage joint action to solve some of the world's biggest problems, such as climate change and poverty.\nMaury Obstfeld, economic counsellor and research department director at the IMF, told CNBC Monday that there was a broad cyclical upswing but many of the factors driving growth were temporary in nature.\n\"We think that policymakers should not sit back and rest on their laurels (and) think that we're in a new normal where everything will be great. They have to look ahead and look at the broad range of policies that can make growth stronger, and more resilient\" he said.\n\"We like what we're seeing in the short term but the long term picture hasn't changed, the stresses are there. Part of what has supported this recovery since the crisis has been fiscal policy, so we have much higher government debt than we had before, where is the room for governments to do fiscal expansion in a renewed downturn?,\" he said.\nObstfeld added that the organization sees higher household debt in many places and higher corporate debts. He explained that these are fine when interest rates are low but the recovery itself is leading central banks to raise interest rates. \"If that happens abruptly and more quickly than we expect there could be stresses,\" he warned.\nLagarde says complacency is a risk Earlier on Monday, IMF Managing Director (and co-chair of WEF this year) Christine Lagarde echoed that view, saying that growth prospects should not lead to complacency.\n\"Global growth has been accelerating since 2016 and all signs point to a continuous strengthening of that growth this year and next year,\" Lagarde told a press conference at the event.\n\"So this is very welcome news … (but) complacency is one of the risks we should guard against,\" she warned, noting three key reasons why the recovery was not assured.\n\"First of all, there are still too many people who are left out of that recovery and acceleration of growth. In fact, about one fifth of emerging and developing countries saw their per capita income decline in 2017. The second reason is that this is clearly a mostly cyclical recovery and, absent continuous reforms, the fundamental forces that had us so worried about this new mediocre that we feared, in other words, the scars from the crisis — the low productivity, the ageing population and future potential growth — all of that will continue to weigh on medium-term prospects.\"\nThe third reason she noted was that there was a build-up of \"potentially serious financial sector vulnerabilities\" and that there had been a \"troubling\" increase in debt across many countries.\nMarket correction? A possible trigger for a market correction was, the Fund said, a faster-than-expected increase in advanced economy core inflation and interest rates as demand accelerates.\n\"If global sentiment remains strong and inflation muted, then financial conditions could remain loose into the medium term, leading to a build-up of financial vulnerabilities in advanced and emerging market economies alike. Inward-looking policies, geopolitical tensions, and political uncertainty in some countries also pose downside risks.\"\nThe IMF encouraged a shared endeavour among economies to make reforms, saying on Monday that the current cyclical upswing provided a good opportunity to do so.\n\"Shared priorities across all economies include implementing structural reforms to boost potential output and making growth more inclusive. In an environment of financial market optimism, ensuring financial resilience is imperative.\n\"Weak inflation suggests that slack remains in many advanced economies and monetary policy should continue to remain accommodative. However, the improved growth momentum means that fiscal policy should increasingly be designed with an eye on medium-term goals — ensuring fiscal sustainability and bolstering potential output. Multilateral cooperation remains vital for securing the global recovery.\"\nFollow CNBC International on Twitter and Facebook .", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-22T16:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-22T16:32:47.032+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
