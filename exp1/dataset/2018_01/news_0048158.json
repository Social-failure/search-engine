One woman had her hair pulled. An elderly lady took a box on her head. Another had a bloody hand,” one customer told the newspaper Le Progres.\nThe Ferrero company, Nutella’s producer, distanced itself from the sticky situation. The decision was entirely one made by Intermarche and Ferrero regretted it, a company statement said.\nWriting by Sudip Kar-Gupta; Editing by Richard Lough and Angus MacSwan\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-26T15:55:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-26T16:14:33.003+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
