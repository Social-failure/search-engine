And a lot more work needs to be done to ensure appropriate use of medicines - both new ones and the thousands of tonnes of older pills churned out each year by generic companies.\n\"There's definitely more that all companies can do,\" said Jayasree Iyer, executive director of AMF, which published the analysis at the World Economic Forum annual meeting in Davos.\n\"We need to strengthen the research and development pipeline - and when new products reach the market we need to ensure that they are used in a conservative way, so that misuse and overuse is limited.\"\nThere are now 28 experimental antibiotics in late-stage development against critical pathogens but only two of these are supported by plans to ensure they can be both made accessible and used wisely if they reach the market.\nThe AMF said four companies—GSK, Shionogi, Pfizer and Novartis —had taken steps to separate sales representatives' bonuses from the volume of antibiotics sold, but much more needed to be done across the industry to counter overuse.\nAnother under-recognized problem is the pollution caused by mass production of antibiotics, due to lax oversight of wastewater run-off.\nIn India's Hyderabad region, for example, the presence of hundreds of drug factories and inadequate water treatment has left lakes and rivers laced with antibiotics, making the area a giant Petri dish for anti-microbial resistance.\nThe AMF urged multinational drugmakers to do more to ensure that their suppliers of bulk antibiotic ingredients were complying with rigorous wastewater standards.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-23T19:05:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-23T19:18:59.024+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
