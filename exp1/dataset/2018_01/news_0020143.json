Details of the tie-up are still being negotiated and the announcement should be made toward the end of the first quarter of 2018, the sources said.\n“Mitsui was chosen, but the talks are still ongoing to reach a final deal. It is complex,” said a source at Pemex, who requested anonymity.\nPemex and Mitsui’s office in Mexico City both declined to comment.\nFILE PHOTO: A crane is seen moving a new coke drum to be collocated in a platform at the Mexico's state-owned company Pemex refinery in Tula, Hidalgo, Mexico April 18, 2017. REUTERS/Carlos Jasso/File Photo A global slump in oil prices since late 2014 and mounting debt have forced the Mexican oil firm to seek partners to help fund key projects.\nSo far, Pemex has invested $1.24 billion in the $2.6 billion coking plant project, according to the company. Pemex’s partner will need to finance the rest of the project, one of the sources said.\nPemex logo is pictured during the launch of a new franchise and commercial strategy by Pemex, in Mexico City, Mexico, November 15, 2017. REUTERS/Edgard Garrido - RC1A9CB5D280 The Tula facility, Pemex’s second largest among six domestic refineries, has the capacity to process 315,000 barrels per day (bpd) of crude. However, it only processed an average of 219,000 bpd in the first 11 months of 2017.\nPemex has said that the new coking plant will increase the refinery’s gasoline output by 40 percent by allowing for the processing of fuel oil.\nThe construction of the plant began at the end of 2014 and is expected to be completed in 2021 by the new partner.\nReporting by Ana Isabel Martinez, Writing by Michael O'Boyle, Editing by Rosalba O'Brien\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-01-17T05:26:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-16T23:49:24.025+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
