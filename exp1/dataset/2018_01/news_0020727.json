The North Korea’s International Olympics Committee (IOC) official said the committee is considering the proposal, while the two sides will also have talks hosted by IOC on Jan. 20.\nIn a joint statement after 11 hours of talks on Tuesday, North and South Korea said they had agreed to hold military to military talks and that North Korea would send a large delegation to next month’s Winter Olympics.\nWashington welcomed as a first step to solving the North Korean nuclear weapons crisis, even though Pyongyang said those were aimed only at the United States and not up for discussion.\nReporting by Dahee Kim; editing by Alexander Smith and Ros Russell\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-13T13:46:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-13T14:09:15.020+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
