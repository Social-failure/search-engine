He was ousted in a coup weeks before the elections that brought Nelson Mandela to power.\n“I spoke to him (Mangope) on a number of occasions urging him to let his people decide, but he would not listen,” Mandela wrote in his autobiography “Long Walk to Freedom.”\nThe ruling African National Congress extended its condolences on his passing while noting in a statement that Mangope was “an outspoken opponent of the democratization project in South Africa.”\nMangope invited investors to Bophuthatswana and the gambling resort Sun City - a flashpoint for anti-apartheid protests - was established there, skirting the ban on casinos imposed by the socially conservative National Party in South Africa.\nTribal leaders still hold away in the former homelands, exercising what critics say is almost feudal control over impoverished rural populations.\nMuch of Bophuthatswana and other homelands lie over the world’s richest platinum reserves, and producers of the precious metal have had to strike deals with tribal leaders, which have often come unstuck, threatening production.\nUnder apartheid, Pretoria maintained the fiction that the homelands were independent states as justification for denying black South Africans the vote, while the mining and other industries used them as sources of cheap, migrant labor.\nReporting by Ed Stoddard, editing by Larry King\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-19T16:04:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-19T11:44:57.019+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
