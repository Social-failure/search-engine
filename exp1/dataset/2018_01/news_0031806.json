Other data on Thursday showed the number of Americans filing for unemployment benefits dropped to a 45-year low last week.\n\"Housing starts were held down by the cold winter weather but should bounce back quickly in coming months as the country warms up from this recent cold spell,\" said Chris Rupkey, chief economist at MUFG in New York.\nHousing starts decreased 8.2 percent to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.192 million units last month, the Commerce Department said. November's sales pace was revised up to 1.299 million units from the previously reported 1.297 million units.\nThe percentage drop for housing starts in December was the largest since November 2016. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast housing starts declining to a pace of 1.275 million units last month. Homebuilding increased 2.4 percent to 1.202 million units in 2017, the highest level since 2007.\nBuilding permits edged down 0.1 percent to a rate of 1.302 million units in December, outpacing starts, which suggests a rebound in groundbreaking in the coming months. Building permits increased 4.7 percent to 1.263 million units in 2017, also the highest level since 2007.\nThe PHLX housing index was trading higher after the data, outperforming a weaker U.S. stock market. Shares of Lennar Corp rose 0.4 percent and those of PulteGroup gained 1 percent. But shares of D.R. Horton, the nation's largest homebuilder, fell 1.2 percent.\nThe dollar was little changed against a basket of currencies and prices of U.S. Treasuries were trading lower.\nDespite December's drop in housing starts, economists continued to believe that investment in homebuilding contributed to gross domestic product growth in the fourth quarter after being a drag for two straight quarters.\nLast month, single-family homebuilding, which accounts for the largest share of the housing market, tumbled 11.8 percent to a rate of 836,000 units as construction fell in the South, the Northeast and Midwest regions. Homebuilding was unchanged in the West.\nSingle-family home permits advanced 1.8 percent in December to their highest level since August 2007, suggesting an acceleration in groundbreaking on that segment of the housing sector was likely. Starts for the volatile multi-family segment rose 1.4 percent to a rate of 356,000 units.\nSingle-family home completions surged 4.3 percent to a five-month high. The number of single-family units under construction was the highest since June 2008, which should help ease an acute shortage of properties on the market that is pushing up prices.\nThere were 794,000 single-family housing units completed in 2017, the most in nine years.\n\"The increase in completions signals some relief for the supply shortage,\" said Mark Fleming, chief economist at First American in Washington.\nCLAIMS FALL SHARPLY\nIn a separate report on Thursday, the Labor Department said initial   1973.\nEconomists had   risen over the previous four weeks, with analysts   the cold   seven states and one territory were estimated last week.  \nLast  \n\"Employers are increasingly facing a mismatch between their hiring needs and the availability of qualified candidates to fill those needs,\" said Jim Baird, chief investment officer at Plante Moran Financial Advisors in Kalamazoo, Michigan.
