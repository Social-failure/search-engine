As of September 30, 2017, we owned interests in 117 operating and redevelopment properties totaling approximately 23.1 million square feet and two development projects currently under construction.\nOur strategy is to maximize the cash flow of our operating properties, successfully complete the construction and lease-up of our redevelopment and development portfolio, and identify additional opportunities to acquire or dispose of properties to further strengthen the Company. New investments are focused in the shopping center sector primarily in markets where we believe we can leverage our existing infrastructure and relationships to generate attractive risk-adjusted returns or otherwise in desirable trade areas. Dispositions are generally designed to increase the quality of our portfolio and to strengthen the Company’s balance sheet.\nContact Information: Dan Sink EVP & CFO (317) 577-5609 dsink@kiterealty.com\nSource:Kite Realty Group Trust", "external_links": ["https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=LngZPVhJB7kv3YwUkn8mebgOlYxq8Csjap1hqJwpAIN11NNliB0G1suqCnDMFBpgJx810y5ltgA0125vekxAqHfGKzxsy6384awGKDhPmfM=", "https://www.globenewswire.com/NewsRoom/AttachmentNg/b5e119be-ec73-4326-b91c-7e7eafb1e869"], "published": "2018-01-06T00:20:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-06T00:56:06.004+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
