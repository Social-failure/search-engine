The Argentinian will be receiving an institutional farewell from the club on Wednesday,” Barcelona said in a statement. \n“The club president, Josep Maria Bartomeu and the first team squad will be present. The player will say goodbye to the fans on the pitch ahead of the club’s King’s Cup tie against Espanyol on Thursday.” \nMascherano, 33, joined Barca from Liverpool in 2010 for a reported fee of 22 million euros (19.32 million pounds) and was immediately converted by coach Pep Guardiola from a holding midfielder into a centre back, frequently deputising for injury-plagued former captain Carles Puyol. \nHis departure also frees up the number 14 jersey made famous by Dutch great Johan Cruyff. \nSpanish media have reported that new arrival Philippe Coutinho -- who signed for a club record 142 million pounds earlier this month -- will be given the prestigious squad number.
