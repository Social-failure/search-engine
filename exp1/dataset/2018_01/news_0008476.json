The market regulator is currently reviewing Hochtief’s bid.\nAfter the Spanish ministers’ intervention, Atlantia began preparing for legal action in case its bid was blocked, a source familiar with the matter told Reuters in December.\nDLA Piper and Italy’s Gianni, Origoni, Grippo, Cappelli & Partners are among Atlantia’s legal advisers while Credit Suisse, Mediobanca and Santander are its main banks.\nFreshfields and Linklaters are advising ACS and Hochtief on legal matters alongside a pool of investment banks led by JPMorgan and Lazard.\nAbertis has retained Citi and boutique bank AZ Capital while Spanish law firm Uría Menéndez Abogados is its legal adviser.
