Berlin’s partners are eagerly awaiting a new German government to help drive forward Brexit talks, euro zone reform and EU diplomatic initiatives.\nSenior officials from the SPD, Merkel’s Christian Democrats (CDU) and their Bavarian sister party, the Christian Social Union (CSU), have been holding exploratory talks this week on whether to pursue formal coalition negotiations.\nThe talks are due to conclude on Thursday, before SPD leaders recommend to their members whether they should shift into official negotiations.\n“We have a lot of work ahead of us today and tomorrow,” said conservative Finance Minister Peter Altmaier.\nParticipants have described the negotiations as “good”, but SPD leaders need to convince their party members as they are offering them a vote on Jan. 21 on whether to proceed.\nThe leader of the Jusos youth branch of the SPD told broadcaster ARD that a deal between the coalition negotiators to drop plans to lower carbon dioxide emissions by 40 percent from 1990 levels by 2020 “was not a good start to these talks”.\nMerkel has ruled with the SPD in a sometimes unwieldy “grand coalition” in two of her three previous terms in office, including in the last parliament from 2013-2017. But both parties bled support in the Sept. 24 election, which saw the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) enter the Bundestag (national parliament) for the first time.\nMany in the SPD rank-and-file oppose a repeat of the grand coalition as they fear it will further diminish the identity of the party, which suffered its worst result in September’s vote since 1933. Some SPD members are also concerned that a new grand coalition would make the AfD the main opposition party.\nDespite such reticence, German media reported on Tuesday that conservative and SPD negotiators had reached agreement on a law to attract skilled immigrants.\nShould the two biggest party groups fail to agree on moving ahead, Merkel could try to form a minority government or Germany could face new elections.\nPresident Frank-Walter Steinmeier, eager to broker a deal, is keenly aware that the source of Germany’s international clout is its economic might and that businesses want a stable coalition soon to end the uncertainty and avoid another vote.\nWriting by Paul Carrel; editing by Mark Heinrich\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-10T12:40:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-10T12:53:38.075+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
