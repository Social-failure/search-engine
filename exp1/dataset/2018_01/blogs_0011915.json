He said as a result of the tax bill a stock owner's share of profits went to 79 percent from 65 percent. \n\"That's more than a 20 percent increase in the earning power. And you've just given it to me, nothing has changed in the business,\" he said. \nIn similar fashion, Bank of America Merrill Lynch on Jan. 3 raised its 2018 earnings-per-share forecast for the S&P 500 to $153 from $139 or 10 percent, using similar thinking. \nBuffett also said the magnitude of the corporate tax rate cut is not reflected in the stock market yet. \n\"I think 21 percent was not baked in. That's a huge reduction,\" he added. \nBuffett's right-hand man, Charlie Munger, welcomed the tax reform as economic policy more than his partner. \n\"I actually like this tax reduction that Berkshire's gotten. I'm an unabashed appreciator,\" he told CNBC on Wednesday. \nOn the tax plan he said, \"I think there is a chance that it might work quite well … I think the people that are sure that it won't work probably shouldn't be quite so sure.\" \nOther top hedge fund managers are on board in predicting further gains for the stock market, partly due to the higher profit streams from the lower tax burden. \nHedge fund manager David Tepper of Appaloosa Management told CNBC on Thursday that the market still isn't expensive. \n\"Explain to me where this market is rich? It's not rich with the tax thing that just changed earnings projections. With earnings forecasts going up and interest rates where they are, how is this market expensive? I don't see the overvaluation. World growth is higher,\" Tepper said. \nJana Partners' Barry Rosenstein, who manages $5 billion, said he is finding more stock ideas that fit the firm's criteria \"than any other time.\" \n\"I agree with David [Tepper] completely. We are more invested today than we've ever been,\" he said Tuesday on CNBC. \"The economy is growing. Earnings are growing. Rates are at all-time lows. It just seems like the market [rally] is going to continue for awhile.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-10T20:49:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-10T21:55:59.002+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
