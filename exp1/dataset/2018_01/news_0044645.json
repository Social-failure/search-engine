Slideshow (2 Images) \nIt noted that no damage was incurred in 2016, when similar measures were taken for fear of water damage to exhibits. \nForecasters predicted further flooding could lift the river by 6 metres (yards) or more in total. With the water level rising one to two centimetres per hour, the river had hit 5.24 metres at 1 p.m. (1200 GMT/0800 EST) on Wednesday. \nCrunch-time is expected on Friday or Saturday, following more heavy rainfall forecast for Thursday. \nFlooding caused destruction in Paris in 1910, when the Seine rose by 8.65 metres, a level that was topped only once on record, in February 1658.
