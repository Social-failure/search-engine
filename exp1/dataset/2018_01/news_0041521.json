Infosys contributed the most to the rise, climbing as much as 3.7 percent.\n“Valuations of growth-oriented sectors are high, so broader focus is on defensive sectors like IT and pharma. After seeing some stabilisation in quarterly numbers, investors are shifting towards IT,” said Vinod Nair, Head of Research at Geojit Financial Services.\nThe Nifty Pharma index rose for a fourth consecutive session, climbing as much as 0.5 percent.\nThe broader NSE index was up 0.01 percent at 11,085.20 as of 0626 GMT, after rising as much as 0.24 percent to hit an all-time high of 11,110.10 points.\nThe benchmark BSE index was 0.06 percent higher at 36,161.56, having earlier climbed 0.35 percent to hit a peak of 36,268.19 points.\nMeanwhile, investors booked profits in market heavyweights such as Reliance Industries Ltd, which fell as much as 2.1 percent after gaining in the last three sessions. ICICI Bank Ltd fell 2.6 percent, after rising in seven of the last eight sessions.\nSince the last ten trading days were very positive, some kind of profit-booking can be seen just before the budget, Nair added.\nShares of Indian telecom services providers also fell after Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd cut tariffs to counter bigger rival Bharti Airtel Ltd’s revision in data plans.\nBharti Airtel led losses on the NSE index, falling as much as 6.2 percent. Idea Cellular Ltd fell as much as 5.7 percent while Reliance Communications Ltd slipped over 2 percent.\nIndiabulls Housing Finance Ltd rose 2.2 percent while PNB Housing Finance Ltd climbed 2.9 percent after posting strong third-quarter results.\nUnited Spirits Ltd slid as much as 6.7 percent after the liquor company on Tuesday posted smaller-than-expected third-quarter profit.
