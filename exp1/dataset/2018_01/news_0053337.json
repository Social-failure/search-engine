The previous rate was 10.5 percent. \nThe board, which consists of three judges, held a trial last year in which the trade group squared off against Spotify, Apple, Alphabet , Pandora Media and Amazon.com , which had opposed NMPA's proposed rate increase. \n\"This is the best mechanical rate scenario for songwriters in U.S. history which is critically important as interactive streaming continues to dominate the market,\" said NMPA chief executive David Isrealite in a statement. \nA Pandora spokeswoman declined to comment. \nRepresentatives of Apple, Alphabet, Spotify and Amazon did not immediately return requests for comment. \nStreaming services must pay a fee, known as a \"mechanical license,\" every time a user listens to a song. \nThese licensing fees are typically paid to music publishing companies like Sony/ATV Music Publishing, which collect the fees on behalf of recording artists in exchange for a commission. \nU.S. law requires the Copyright Royalty Board to set the rates for these mechanical licenses, rather than letting publishers negotiate rates with streaming services.
