REUTERS/Toru Hanai Had he grabbed the third set a fightback might have been on the cards, although Chung, who frazzled fourth-seeded German wunderkind Alexander Zverev in five sets in the previous round, can apparently run all night.\n“I was just thinking ‘I‘m two love up in sets so if I lose (the third) I still have two more sets. I can play two more hours. I‘m younger than Novak so I don’t care!'” he said.\n“I was just trying to copy Novak because he’s my idol. My dreams have come true tonight.”\nSlideshow (8 Images) OUTPLAYED Djokovic was always playing catch-up once he had dropped his opening two service games with a rash of double faults to trail 4-0. He clawed back that deficit, hit back from 4-1 in the second set and 3-1 in the third but could never get to grips with an opponent few will fancy facing.\n“Congratulations to Chung on an amazing performance,” Djokovic said. “He deserved to win. Whenever he was in trouble he came out with some great passing shots and at the back of the court he was like a wall.”\nRelated Coverage Djokovic to reassess options over elbow injury Young gun Chung blazes trail for South Korea Nadal braced for tough Cilic test in Melbourne showdown There were signs that Djokovic was in pain with his elbow in the first set and he required treatment on that and his feet after losing the tiebreak 7-3.\nThe relentless Chung moved 4-1 ahead in the second set but again Djokovic recovered, only to falter when serving at 5-6. On set point Djokovic pounded three consecutive forehands deep in into Chung’s backhand, each one returned at full stretch, before Djokovic cracked and netted a forehand.\nDjokovic fed off the energy of the crowd as he pushed for a break at 5-5 in the third set but there was no escape as Chung refused to flinch in a gripping climax.\nReporting by Martyn Herman, editing by Ed Osmond and Christian Radnedge\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-22T13:44:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-22T13:55:45.006+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
