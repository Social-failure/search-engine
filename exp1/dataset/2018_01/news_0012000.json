The Kahrizak prison gained notoriety when a handful of detainees were killed and tortured at the site after unrest in 2009.\nIran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei gestures as he speaks, Iran, January 9, 2018.

We must listen, we must hear. We must provide answers within our means,” Khamenei was Quote: d as saying, hinting that not only the government of Rouhani, but his own clerical leadership must also respond.\n“I am also responsible. All of us must follow up,” Khamenei said.\nReporting by Babak Dehghanpisheh and additional reporting by Maayan Lubell; Editing by Robin Pomeroy\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-09T12:12:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-09T12:27:04.014+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
