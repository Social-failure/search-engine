You want it to happen yesterday. Playing a grand slam over two weeks is tough for a 20-year-old to keep the concentration and keep the rhythm going.\n”It’s easier when you’re older and you have done it before. When you are 19 or 20 you want to play the final tomorrow!\nFILE PHOTO: Tennis - Australian Open - Melbourne Park, Melbourne, Australia, January 10, 2018.
