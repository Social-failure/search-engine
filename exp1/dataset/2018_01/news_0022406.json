In 2018, Sigfox plans to expand its reach into over 60 countries and connect up to 10 million devices.\nTo help achieve these ambitious goals, Sigfox is turning its focus to operations.\nFranck Siegel, a former officer in the French Navy, joined Sigfox in October, after stints at companies including BT, Verizon and Dimension Data, where he was Director of Strategic Services. Siegel will lead Sigfox’s Marketing, Engineering, Operations, IT, Security, Programme Management Office and Human Resources.\nOver the last few months, Franck has been focused on setting up a Corporate Programme Management Office. He has also launched significant initiatives around organisation of the Sigfox portfolio and expansion of the Global Sigfox Operating Architecture, to improve the scalability and flexibility of its core IoT network and cloud infrastructure.\n\"I am very glad to welcome Franck to Sigfox. I believe he will bring great value to our organisation thanks to his rigour and vast experience in managing multi-million-euro service businesses, driving large transformation programmes and leading global strategy execution plans. In only a few short months, he has become a key pillar within the company. I am sure that together, and with our talented team, we will take Sigfox to the next level, in what is shaping up to be an exciting year for us”, said Ludovic Le Moan, co-founder and CEO of Sigfox.\n\"I joined Sigfox because I believe in the vision of its two founders” adds Franck. “In my first few weeks, I have been busy learning more about Sigfox and its technology. The first phase of Sigfox’s journey, which I like to refer to as ‘Capability Expansion', has proven to be a great success. We have now set the right foundations to enter the second phase.”\nFor more information on Sigfox, please visit our corporate website or find us on Twitter or LinkedIn\nAbout Sigfox\nSigfox is the world’s leading provider of connectivity for the Internet of Things (IoT).
