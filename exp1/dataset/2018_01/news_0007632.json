(Nasdaq: HOLX) announced today preliminary revenue results for its first fiscal quarter ended December 30, 2017.\nThe Company expects to report total revenues of approximately $791 million, an increase of almost 8% compared to the prior year period, and a 7% increase in constant currency. These preliminary results compare to the Company's prior guidance range of $775 to $790 million. Revenues by division are expected to be:\n$s in millions\nPreliminary\nQ1'18*\nQ1'17\nDiagnostics\n$285\n$325\nDiagnostics ex.

Hologic also had four fewer selling days in the first quarter of fiscal 2018 than in the prior year period.\nIn addition, primarily as a result of the recent passage of comprehensive U.S. tax reform legislation, the Company expects its non-GAAP effective tax rate to be approximately 23% to 24% in fiscal 2018, lower than its prior guidance of approximately 31%. The Company expects its GAAP effective tax rate to be negative for the year, largely based on the revaluation of its deferred taxes, but this analysis is ongoing.\n\"We expect to post solid first quarter revenue just above our guidance range, driven by strength in our breast health, molecular diagnostics and international businesses,\" said Steve MacMillan, Hologic's Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer. \"In addition, U.S. tax reform will allow us to achieve a lower effective tax rate in fiscal 2018, increasing our profitability while simultaneously providing opportunities to re-invest in the business to drive future growth.\"\nHologic is providing these updates in advance of the Company's participation in the 36 th Annual J.P. Morgan Healthcare Conference, which begins today. The Company will post its conference presentation to the investors section of its website at http://investors.hologic.com/ . Live webcasts of the Company's presentation and question and answer session, which begin at 11 a.m. Pacific Time on January 9, may be accessed on the investors section of Hologic's website at http://investors.hologic.com . The webcasts will be available for 30 days following the events.\nThe preliminary revenue results described in this press release are estimates only and are subject to revision until the Company reports its full financial results for the first quarter of fiscal 2018 on February 8, 2018. Actual results may differ materially from those estimated.\nU se of Non-GAAP Financial Measures\nThe Company has presented certain non-GAAP financial measures in this press release: constant currency percentage change in revenues, and tax rate. Constant currency calculations show reported current period revenues as if the foreign exchange rates remain the same as those in effect in the comparable prior year period. These non-GAAP financial measure should be considered supplemental to, and not a substitute for, financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. The Company's definition of these non-GAAP measures may differ from similarly titled measures used by others.\nThe non-GAAP financial measures used in this press release adjust for specified items that can be highly variable or difficult to predict. The Company generally uses these non-GAAP financial measures to facilitate management's financial and operational decision-making, including evaluation of Hologic's historical operating results and comparison to competitors' operating results. These non-GAAP financial measures reflect an additional way of viewing aspects of the Company's operations that, when viewed with GAAP results and the reconciliations to corresponding GAAP financial measures (when they become available), may provide a more complete understanding of factors and trends affecting Hologic's business.\nBecause non-GAAP financial measures exclude the effect of items that increase or decrease the company's reported results of operations, management strongly encourages investors to review, when they become available, the Company's consolidated financial statements and publicly filed reports in their entirety.\nAbout Hologic, Inc.\nHologic, Inc. is an innovative medical technology company primarily focused on improving women's health and well-being through early detection and treatment.
