They both deny wrongdoing. \nUndenge is accused of issuing a $12,650 contract without due tender to a company that did no work, according to a charge sheet seen by Reuters. \nMzembi and Undenge were both granted bail on Saturday, asked to surrender their passports and remanded until Jan. 22 when their cases will be heard. \n“We are going to make an application for an exception to the charge because the charges that my client is facing are ridiculous,” Job Sikhala, Mzembi’s lawyer, told reporters outside the court. \nUndenge’s lawyer Alex Muchadehama described the case against his client as a “circus”. \nFormer finance minister Ignatius Chombo is on bail after being charged in November over accusations he tried to defraud the central bank over a decade ago. Chombo denies wrongdoing.
