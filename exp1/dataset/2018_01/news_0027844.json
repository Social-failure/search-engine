The emails said Schoeman tested positive for Prednisolone. \nReuters has not been able to verify the specific allegation which was also not addressed by the ITU statement or Lamond. \nThe use of Prednisolone is allowed outside of competition, but prohibited by the IOC without prior consent during races. \nThe South African had declared his use of a variant, Prednisone, on a doping form leaked by Fancy Bears, which said he had used the immune suppressant up to July 17, 2016. \nThe leaked email correspondence, which has not been verified by Reuters, questions whether Schoeman had a Therapeutic Use Exemption (TUE) that would have allowed him to compete with the substance in his system. \nThe emails do not come to a conclusion as to whether a TUE had been found or not, or whether one was retroactively submitted as is allowed in certain cases. \nPrednisolone is a steroid medication used to treat allergies, inflammatory conditions, autoimmune disorders and cancers. \nFancy Bears have previously leaked data from the World Anti-Doping Agency’s ADAMS system about other athletes.
