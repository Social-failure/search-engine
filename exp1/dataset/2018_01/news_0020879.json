Gold peaked at $1,920 in 2011.\nRussia’s far eastern Magadan region, also known as Kolyma, is famous for gold deposits, where prisoners of Stalin’s Gulag labour camps were forced to work during Soviet times.\nThe area will host Russia’s largest gold mine, Natalka, when its owner Polyus hikes its output by 2019.\nRussia produced 193.58 tonnes of gold in the first eight months of 2017, up from 179.73 tonnes in the same period of 2016.
