This is part of a nationwide protest by the EFF against an ad for a child’s sweater which was seen as racist. Demonstrations were also taking place at other malls in the Gauteng province, eNCA said. \nH&M this week pulled the garment in question from its stores and apologized. An image in its online store showed a black child modeling a hoodie with the text “coolest monkey in the jungle,” causing a social-media storm and prompting Canadian musician The Weeknd to end his collaboration with the Stockholm-based company.
