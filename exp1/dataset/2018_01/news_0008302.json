Embraer is the third largest producer of civil aircraft, after Airbus and Boeing.\nThe Brazilian government holds a controlling \"golden share\" in Embraer and can veto any deal agreed.\nIn an interview with the Financial Times , Brazil's defence minister said that his government would allow a partnership or joint venture but ruled out any change of ownership to Boeing.\n\"The only limitation we see is the transfer of shareholding control,\" Raul Jungmann said. \"Other than that, partnership, joint venture, whatever it is, is very welcome.\"\nThe article also cited unnamed sources who are reportedly close to discussions and claim Boeing isn't interested in a joint venture and is only seeking a takeover.\nCNBC has contacted Boeing and Embraer for comment but had not had any response at the time of publication.\nFor more on this story please click here .", "external_links": ["https://www.ft.com/content/ec9c628c-f1b6-11e7-ac08-07c3086a2625"], "published": "2018-01-05T13:47:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-05T13:10:58.010+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
