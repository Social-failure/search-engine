Dolezaj, who entered the game averaging 3.7 points per outing, capped the run with a jumper that extended the Orange’s advantage to 60-42.\nLed by Robinson’s drives and Bowman’s treys, the Eagles outscored Syracuse 11-5 to cut their deficit to 67-55. But Chukwu made a pair of free throws after a lane violation nullified a miss on a one-and-one opportunity, and Battle sank a 3-pointer to boost Syracuse’s lead back to 72-55.\nThe Eagles connected on their first five shots, including four 3-pointers, to grab a 14-7 lead. But they made only seven of their remaining 20 shots in the first half as the Orange outscored Boston College 40-23 after falling behind 14-7.\nHoward (16) and Brissett (12) combined for 28 points as Syracuse shot 64.3 percent from the floor (18-for-28) and 55.6 percent from beyond the arc (5-for-9) in the first half. The Orange led 47-37 at the break - the most points Syracuse has scored in the first half all season.\nSyracuse starting forward Matthew Moyer sprained his left ankle about five minutes into the game and did not return. Boston College starting forward Steffon Mitchell left the game midway through the first half after suffering an undisclosed injury and remained out for the rest of the contest.\nNeither Syracuse nor Boston College can afford serious injuries as both have struggled with depth. Among 351 Division I teams, the Orange and Eagles rank 349th and 350th, respectively, in terms of bench minutes.\n--Field Level Media\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-01-25T10:31:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-25T13:20:31.024+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
