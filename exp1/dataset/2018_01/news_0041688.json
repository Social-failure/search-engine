The ovens convert coal into coke, a fuel used in blast furnaces in iron ore smelting. \nAdditionally, Cokenergy will spend $250,000 on a lead abatement project in the East Chicago area to reduce lead hazards in schools, day-care centers, and other buildings. \nLead pollution harms brain function in children and can cause other health problems. Sulfur dioxide is a particulate that can harm human lungs and hearts. \nThe companies will pay the $5 million fine in equal amounts to the U.S. federal government and the state of Indiana, the department said.
