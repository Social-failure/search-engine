It initially worked with Goldman Sachs on a possible bid but subsequently decided to pull out, the sources said.\n\"While we would normally not comment on market speculation or rumors, in this instance we refute assertions that we are in negotiation for Pfizer's consumer business,\" J&J's vice president of media relations Ernie Knewitz told Reuters.\nGoldman was not immediately available to comment.\nGSK has hired JPMorgan and Citi to work on the deal, while Reckitt has turned to Bank of America, the five sources said.\nBritain's GSK and Reckitt declined to comment, as did JPMorgan, while Citi and Bank of America were not available.\nA spokeswoman for Pfizer, whose CEO Ian Read wants to focus on prescription medicines, declined to comment on the sale process, saying only that any decision on the future of the unit would be made in 2018.\nThe deal could be a game-changer for rival drugmaker GSK or consumer goods group Reckitt by making them one of the biggest global players in consumer health, an increasingly lucrative sector as ageing populations and health-conscious consumers drive demand for self-medication.\nAlthough consumer remedies sold over the counter have lower margins than prescription drugs, they are typically very well known and durable brands with loyal customers.\nPrice matters The prospective sale, which is being organized by Centerview Partners, Guggenheim Securities and Morgan Stanley, was first mooted on Oct. 10, when Pfizer announced the strategic review for the unit, which had sales of about $3.4 billion in 2016.\nTwo of the sources said Pfizer valued the asset at more than 20 times its core earnings, or $20 billion, and was reluctant to accept less.\nBut J&J's decision to steer clear leaves the drugmaker with one less big bidder, which may affect its negotiating power.\nPfizer sold its previous consumer healthcare business to J&J in 2006 for $16.6 billion and the U.S. group, with interests from baby powder to cancer drugs, had been seen as a logical buyer for the current assets.\nYet it could have faced possible antitrust problems if it beefs up its presence in the sector, said one of the sources who is familiar with the company.\nPfizer aims to clinch a deal before the summer, another source said, adding that there had been enough interest in the asset to stage a competitive auction.\nA sale would confirm the consumer health sector, which is still fragmented, as fertile ground for deal-making following a spate of transactions in recent years.\nOther companies that are considering making bids include Swiss consumer food giant Nestle , said the five sources. Nestle's CEO Mark Shneider is a healthcare veteran and wants a deeper focus on nutrition, health and wellness.\nNestle declined to comment.\nThe firm recently sold its U.S. confectionery business to Italy's Ferrero for $2.8 billion. It is now seeking to buy Merck 's consumer health unit, sources have previously told Reuters, as part of its healthcare drive.\nBut while Pfizer's Centrum vitamin and Caltrate calcium supplements could fit with Nestle's new strategic direction, the U.S. firm's Advil painkillers and Robitussin cough medicine are far removed from its core businesses like coffee, chocolate and baby food, the sources said.\nA sixth source said Pfizer was likely to receive five or six bids in total. Pfizer CEO Read said on Oct. 31 that he expected no shortage of suitors for the business.\nReuters reported on Oct. 10 that established consumer health companies that may bid for Pfizer's unit include Abbott and Procter & Gamble .", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-25T17:39:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-25T17:56:29.059+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
