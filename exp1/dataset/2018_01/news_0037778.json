(NASDAQ:SMED) (“Sharps” or the “Company”), a leading full-service national provider of comprehensive waste management solutions including medical, pharmaceutical and hazardous, today reported financial results for second quarter and first six months of fiscal year 2018, which ended December 31, 2017.\nRevenue in the second quarter of fiscal 2018 increased 15% to $11.1 million, as compared to revenue of $9.7 million in the same prior year quarter, with gross margin of 28%, down slightly from gross margin of 30% in the second quarter of fiscal 2017. Gross margin was adversely impacted in the second quarter by unplanned repair and maintenance costs at our treatment facilities in both Pennsylvania and Texas as well as start-up expenses related to the launch of a second shift at the Pennsylvania plant. The Company reported operating income of $0.1 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2018, compared to an operating loss of ($0.2) million in the second quarter of fiscal 2017. Sharps recorded net income of $0.2 million or $0.01 per basic and diluted share in the second quarter of fiscal 2018, compared to a net loss of $0.2 million or ($0.01) per basic and diluted share in the second quarter of fiscal 2017.\nDavid P. Tusa, President and Chief Executive Officer of Sharps, stated, “We delivered solid second quarter results with increased billings across all markets of our business contributing to our consolidated revenue growth. Our Retail business saw significant gains related to increased flu shot related orders, as well as growing demand for our unused medication solutions including the MedSafe in the Retail pharmacy market. Additionally, our environmental business saw triple digit growth related to third-party business at our treatment facility in Texas. With the volume growth at our treatment facility in Pennsylvania, we’ve added a second shift which is a positive development for the long term but resulted in some one-time expenses which compressed gross margins a bit in the quarter. Our route-based business now serves 23 states or 48% of the population and contributes 16% of overall revenues. In the small and medium quantity generator market, our ability to provide a diversified solution, be it route-based, mailback or a combination of the two, depending on our customers’ needs, is a competitive advantage as we focus on growing our market share and our reach.”\nSecond Quarter Review\nProfessional market billings increased 11% to $3.4 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2018 compared to $3.0 million in the prior year period. This increase was attributable to organic growth as the Company continued its focus on securing customers from the small to medium quantity generator sector consisting largely of physicians, clinics, dentists, surgery centers, veterinarians and other healthcare professionals, who benefit from the cost-effective and convenient Sharps Recovery System™ and the Company’s route-based pick-up services. The Company’s inside and online sales channel, which primarily targets the Professional and Government markets, realized a 12% increase in billings to $1.6 million in the fiscal 2018 second quarter from $1.4 million in the same prior year period.\nRetail market billings increased 57% to $2.6 million compared with $1.6 million in the prior year period, reflecting an increase in flu shot related orders as well as increased order activity for the unused medication solutions including the MedSafe in the Retail pharmacy market.\nPharmaceutical Manufacturer billings increased 5% to $1.5 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2018 compared to $1.4 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2017. The increase is related to the timing of inventory builds for patient support programs. On a trailing twelve month basis, Pharmaceutical Manufacturer billings increased 12% to $5.8 million compared to the prior year.\nAssisted Living market billings grew 9% to $0.6 million for the second quarter of fiscal 2018 and second quarter 2018 Home Health Care billings grew 5% to $2.1 million. Environmental billings increased to $0.3 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2018 as compared to $0.1 million in the second quarter of the prior year due to higher third-party treatment billings from our treatment facility in Texas.\nGovernment billings increased 11% to $0.4 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2018. Government market billings included $0.1 million of orders under the VA’s Blanket Purchase Agreement, consistent with the second quarter of fiscal 2017. MedSafe related orders to the government market were $0.2 million for the second quarter of fiscal 2018 consistent with the second quarter of fiscal 2017.\nMr. Tusa added, “Our Retail market had significant growth in the quarter largely due to increased flu shot related orders as well as MedSafe orders in the Retail pharmacy market. We are well underway with the roll out of MedSafe to a major national retail pharmacy chain, and we should see a significant positive impact from this launch during the March 2018 quarter. Our inside and field sales teams continued to drive growth in the Professional market with their focus on matching customers to the best solution offerings for their business, so that they can effectively meet compliance requirements while remaining cost conscious. We remain uniquely positioned to capture business in the Pharma manufacturer market through our solution that not only facilitates proper disposal for medical waste but also provides the ability to track patient data and offers a branding opportunity.\n“Billings from our unused medication management solutions grew $0.6 million, or 78%, for the quarter and represent approximately 12% of overall company revenue. Growing market awareness of our MedSafe and Takeaway Recovery System Envelopes, designed for the safe, convenient and proper disposal of opioid painkillers and other unused medications, positively impacted our Retail, Government, Professional and Assisted Living market billings. As the U.S. contends with a growing opioid crisis, we believe our system offers a proven solution for long-term care facilities, retail and hospital pharmacies, hospice, drug-treatment and licensed law enforcement markets as they work to ensure proper and safe disposal of ultimate user controlled and non-controlled unused or expired medications.”\nAdditional Operating Results\nSG&A decreased to $2.8 million or 25% of sales for the second quarter of fiscal 2018 compared to $2.9 million or 30% of sales in the second quarter of the prior year.\nSharps achieved EBITDA of $0.5 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2018 as compared to EBITDA of $0.2 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2017. ( See Reconciliation of Net Income (Loss) to EBITDA in the supplemental table included at the end of this release).\nRoute-Based Businesses\nDuring the second quarter of fiscal 2018, Sharps recognized $1.8 million in revenue from its route-based service offerings, representing approximately 16% of consolidated customer revenue. This demonstrated an increase as compared to revenues of $1.6 million in the second quarter of 2017 and was consistent with the prior year quarter as a percentage of overall revenue.\nFirst Six Months 2018 Review\nSharps recorded revenue of $20.8 million in the first six months of 2018, an increase of 8% compared to revenue of $19.2 million in the first six months of 2017. Customer billings increased 9% to $20.9 million in the first half of fiscal 2018. Professional billings increased 11% to $6.5 million in the first six months of fiscal 2018 as compared to $5.8 million in the prior year period. In the first half of fiscal 2018, Retail billings increased 8% to $4.0 million as compared to $3.7 million in the first half of fiscal 2017. Pharmaceutical Manufacturer billings decreased 6% to $3.0 million in the first half of 2018 as compared to the first half of fiscal 2017. Home Health Care billings increased 6% to $4.1 million in the first six months of fiscal 2018 as compared to $3.9 million in the prior year period. Assisted Living billings increased 5% to $1.2 million in the first half of fiscal 2018. Government billings increased 17% to $1.0 million in the first six months of fiscal 2018 as compared to $0.8 million in the prior year period.\nGross margin for the first six months of fiscal 2018 was 30%, consistent with the first six months of fiscal 2017. SG&A expense was reduced by 16% to $5.5 million in the first half of fiscal 2018. The first half of the prior year included $0.7 million of one-time expenses related to Sharps’ acquisition of Citiwaste. Without these costs, SG&A for the first half of fiscal 2017 was $5.9 million. The decrease in adjusted SG&A of $0.4 million reflects the impact of cost savings initiatives launched in the second quarter of fiscal 2017. The Company recorded operating income of $0.2 million in the first six months of fiscal 2018 as compared to an operating loss of $1.1 million in the first six months of fiscal 2017.\nNet income for the first six months of fiscal 2018 was $0.2 million or $0.01 per basic and diluted share, compared to a net loss of $1.2 million or a net loss of $0.08 per basic and diluted share in the first six months of fiscal 2017. During the first six months of 2017, the Company recorded approximately $0.7 million in acquisition related expenses associated with the completion of its acquisition of Citiwaste. Excluding these acquisition related expenses, on a non-GAAP basis, the Company reported an adjusted net loss of $0.5 million or ($0.03) per diluted share in the first half of 2017. ( See Reconciliation of Net Income (Loss) to Adjusted Net Income (Loss) in the supplemental table included at the end of this release).\nFinancial Flexibility and a Strong Balance Sheet\nCash and cash equivalents were $5.8 million at December 31, 2017 compared to $4.7 million at June 30, 2017. The Company had working capital of $10.9 million at December 31, 2017 compared to $10.5 million at June 30, 2017.\nLooking Forward\nMr. Tusa concluded, “While our March quarter has been historically weak, we believe the March 2018 quarter could be positively impacted from the continued growth in all of our markets, including Retail, which should show growth related to our unused medication management solutions including the MedSafe. Our route-based business continues to gain traction and reach, complementing our mailback offering while contributing to our ability to service diverse markets with our wide range of cost effective and compliant solutions. As we move through the balance of 2018, we remain focused on expanding our leadership position in our target market of small and medium quantity generators.”\nSecond Quarter Fiscal Year 2018 Webcast and Conference Call\nThe Company will host a teleconference today beginning at 11:00 a.m. Eastern Time, during which management will review the financial and operating results for the period and discuss Sharps’ corporate strategy and outlook.

Other companies may define EBITDA differently. EBITDA is presented because it is a financial measure that is frequently requested by third parties. However, EBITDA is not considered under generally accepted accounting principles as a primary measure of an entity’s financial results, and accordingly, EBITDA should not be considered an alternative to operating income, net income, or cash flows as determined under generally accepted accounting principles and as reported by the Company.
