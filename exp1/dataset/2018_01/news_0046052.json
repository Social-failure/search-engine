Slideshow (6 Images) \nSuarez levelled the score in the tie after eight minutes, nodding in Aleix Vidal’s cross from close range to put Barca ahead on the night before Messi’s deflected effort from distance in the 25th ensured place in the last four. \nEspanyol produced a spirited late comeback but were almost caught on the break when Messi headed against the post. \nBarca join Real Madrid’s conquerors Leganes, Valencia, who on Wednesday beat last season’s runners-up Alaves on penalties, and Sevilla, who thrashed Atletico Madrid, in Friday’s draw for the semis, with the first legs to be played next Wednesday.
