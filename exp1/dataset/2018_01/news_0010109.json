Reid Travis also had 16 points, and Michael Humphrey had 13 points and nine rebounds for the Cardinal, who won their fourth straight game.\nStanford (10-8, 4-1 Pac-12) led for the majority of the second half, but never by much.

Davis followed with a jumper that pushed the Cardinal’s lead to 55-45 with nine minutes to play.\nWashington stayed close, but couldn’t get over the hump. Travis got free for an open layup off of good ball movement to give the Cardinal a 62-56 lead with six minutes to play.\nDavis Crisp added 11 points for Washington and was the only Huskie besides Nowell in double figures.\nStanford dominated on the backboards, outrebounding the Huskies 48-28.
