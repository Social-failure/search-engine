Hendrickson joined the company in 1989 and became CEO in April 2016. \nIn February 2017, Perrigo’s then chief financial officer Judy Brown stepped down and joined Amgen Inc. Ronald Winowiecki was appointed acting CFO. \nPerrigo had suspended its search for a CFO during its search for Hendrickson’s successor as CEO, the company said in a regulatory filing in July.
