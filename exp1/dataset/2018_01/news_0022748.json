The Jusos youth faction is on a “No Grand Coalition” tour to rally delegates to reject the talks.\nNorbert Roemer, head of the SPD’s parliamentary group in North Rhine-Westphalia said results of the exploratory talks did not make clear enough that there would be a fresh start.\nHe told the Sueddeutsche Zeitung newspaper: “In our party - and this is true of me too - there’s a lot of mistrust of Ms Merkel and her troops.”\nThe most divisive issues for the two blocs concern taxes, pensions, migration and healthcare but both parties are aware that a grand coalition is one of the last options on the table.\nRefusal by SPD delegates to hold further talks could lead to new elections or a minority Merkel-led government for the first time in the post-war era.\nBy contrast, Brandenburg and Hamburg are in favour of coalition talks, as are trades unions and a dozen SPD mayors from big cities have also called on delegates to vote in favour.\nHighlighting fears about the destructive effects of the divisions within the SPD, senior party figure Carsten Schneider said “there is a real worry about the survival of the SPD”.\nEdgar Franke, of the SPD’s conservative “Seeheimer Kreis” wing, said if his party refused to join a grand coalition, it risked sliding to 15 or 16 percent. “And it won’t recover from that in the long term,” Franke told Focus magazine.\nMerkel, who needs the SPD to back the alliance to shore up her fourth term, said Germany needed a stable government and that she was counting on the SPD to “take a responsible decision” by giving the go-ahead to formal coalition talks.\nAdditional reporting by Madeline Chambers, Holger Hansen, Tom Koerkemeier; Editing by Matthew Mpoke Bigg\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-17T14:49:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-17T15:16:14.082+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
