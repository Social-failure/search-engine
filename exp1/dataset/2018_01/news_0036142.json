Mainly Protestant unionist paramilitaries, who supported continued rule by Britain, also carried out attacks. \nThe IRA has since disarmed, and its former political wing Sinn Fein has spent most of the past decade serving in a power-sharing provincial government with the main unionist party. \nSinn Fein leader Gerry Adams welcomed the announcement that ONH was now rejecting violence. \n“There can be no excuse or justification for the continued existence and operation of armed groups either unionist or republican,” Adams said in a statement. “I call on all groups engaged in violent actions to desist, disband and to embrace the path of peaceful politics.” \nONH has claimed responsibility for a number of high-profile attacks, including a car bomb that severely disabled Catholic police officer Peadar Heffron in 2010. During The Troubles, nationalist paramilitaries considered Catholics who joined the police to be traitors. \nIn March 2013 the group left a bomb with 60 kilograms of explosives near a hotel where G8 leaders were due to meet three months later. \nIt also targeted British army barracks and police stations in Northern Ireland, and carried out “punishment shootings”, usually non-lethal shots to the leg of young men and boys. \nIn the two decades since the Good Friday agreement, a number of ex-IRA splinter factions have continued to carry out attacks, although far less frequently than before the peace deal. The deadliest took place just months after the agreement: the Omagh bombing in August 1998 that killed 29 people and wounded 220 others, carried out by a group calling itself the Real IRA.
