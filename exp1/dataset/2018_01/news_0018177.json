Don’t use the same one!” to warn against the dangers of trading cryptocurrency, and also more obscure ones, in English, such as “Hot day, forget myself, go to the moon.” Members of Japan's idol group \"Virtual Currency Girls\" wearing cryptocurrency-themed masks pose after performing in their debut stage event in Tokyo, Japan, January 12, 2018. REUTERS/Kim Kyung-Hoon \nNaruse emphasized on the group’s website that it is not out to promote investment, but rather to teach people about cryptocurrencies in an entertaining way. \nThe maid costumes aimed to raise the group’s popularity with the use of a globally recognizable “uniform,” she added. Naturally, all merchandise sold at the venue is paid for in bitcoin, as are concert tickets and the members’ salaries.
