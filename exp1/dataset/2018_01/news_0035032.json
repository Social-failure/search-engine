Tiger Global Management said the hedge fund had no comment on the report.\nStaley has championed investment banking amid calls from some analysts and investors to ditch a business which has in recent years struggled to match the profitability of Barclays’ more mundane retail and credit card units.\nInvestment banks globally have struggled in recent years to make returns in excess of their cost of capital, as tighter regulations, pressure on fees from automation and low global interest rates combined to squeeze profits.\nBarclays is cutting up to 100 senior jobs at its investment banks, Reuters reported on Wednesday.\nIn 2016, around 1,000 jobs were cut from Barclays’ investment banking business worldwide in an attempt to reduce costs and boost revenues. Barclays cut a total of 10,000 employees that year alone.\nReporting by Kanishka Singh in Bengaluru; Editing by Adrian Croft and Paul Simao\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-21T23:47:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-22T00:12:04.005+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
