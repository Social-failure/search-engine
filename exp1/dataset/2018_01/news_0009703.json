I began to feel hopeless about (competing at) the Tokyo Olympics, that it was impossible,” Komatsu added.\nAccording to the report, the JCF probe found that Suzuki had made multiple attempts to sabotage several of his team mates, sometimes by stealing their equipment.\nIshikawa prefecture police are also probing the incident following a complaint from Komatsu.\nReporting by Amlan Chakraborty in New Delhi; Editing by John O'Brien\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-10T12:55:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-10T13:17:18.018+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
