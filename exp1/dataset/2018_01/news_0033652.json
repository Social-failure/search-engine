REUTERS/Simon Dawson \nMay had previously pledged to tackle corporate abuses, and she said in May 2017 she would protect pensions from “irresponsible behaviour by company bosses”, a reference to the public outcry to the demise of department store group BHS after it was sold by billionaire Philip Green. \nShe said on Sunday she had taken action on boardroom excesses, for example giving shareholders a greater say in the pay awarded to bosses, and she was determined that the government would stand up to the small amount of businesses that give the majority a bad name. \nBut she also defended the role of the private sector in providing government services, and the action it had taken after the collapse of Carillion. \n“The state also has a role to play when things go wrong and companies fail, as Carillion did last week,” she said. \n“Not by bailing out the directors with a blank cheque - it will be the shareholders of Carillion, not taxpayers, who pay the price for the company’s collapse - but by stepping in and supporting those affected.” \nOpposition Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn last week called for the end of the “costly racket” of outsourcing public services to private companies after Carillion’s failure.
