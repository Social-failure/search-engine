REUTERS/Aaron Josefczyk \nShares of Whirlpool, which owns brands such as KitchenAid and Maytag, were down 0.5 percent in after hours trading. \nWhirlpool posted a loss of $268 million for the fourth quarter, compared with a profit of $180 million a year earlier, hit by a charge of about $420 million related to the U.S. tax reforms. \nOn an adjusted basis, it earned $4.10 a share, handily beating analysts’ average estimate of $3.99. \nBut, the Benton Harbor, Michigan-based company’s revenue rose 0.8 percent to $5.70 billion, much slower than the 3.2 percent increase to $5.84 billion that Wall Street was expecting. \nThe results come two days after U.S. President Donald Trump slapped steep tariffs on imported washing machines and solar panels, benefiting Whirlpool and dealing a heavy blow to rivals Samsung Electronics ( 005930.KS ) and LG Electronics ( 066570.KS ).
