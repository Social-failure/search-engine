Net revenues of this division for the third quarter ending November 30, 2017 were $36,468,400, an increase of 32.0% from $27,622,600 reported in the third quarter ended November 30, 2016. The average number of active direct sales consultants increased 3,000, or 11.0%, to 31,100 for the quarter ended November 30, 2017, over our average active consultant count in the third quarter of last year.\nOur Publishing’s division net revenues for the quarter ended November 30, 2017 were $2,439,700, a decrease of $635,300, or 20.7% from the revenues reported in the third quarter of last year totaling $3,075,000.\nThe Company’s year to date net revenues in the first three quarters of the fiscal year totaled $90,020,100, an increase of $10,645,300, or 13.4%, from $79,374,800 reported in the same period last year.

These revenues were made possible through the technology and operational improvements that were made this year which increased our daily shipping volumes. Shipments during the quarter were able to keep up with incoming orders without creating a large backlog, which increased revenues and greatly improved customer satisfaction over prior year levels. This also resulted in minimal deferred revenue at the end of the quarter.\n\"We are also reporting record profits for the quarter. These profits result from increased volumes and operational improvements that were made during the last two years. We are very pleased to see trends in reduced handling, packaging and shipping costs and are excited to see these trends continue in the future.”\nMr. White continued, “We are also continuing to make additional investments in cost reducing technologies. During the fiscal fourth quarter, we will be investing approximately $1,000,000 to bring additional automation into our packaging and fulfilment processes, which will further increase our daily shipping capacity and efficiency.”\nEDUCATIONAL DEVELOPMENT CORPORATION CONDENSED STATEMENTS OF EARNINGS (UNAUDITED) Three Months Ended November 30 Nine Months Ended November 30 2017 2016 2017 2016 NET REVENUES 38,908,000 30,697,600 90,020,100 79,374,800 EARNINGS BEFORE INCOME TAXES 3,432,800 2,040,100 7,097,700 3,565,400 INCOME TAXES 1,304,400 765,900 2,707,100 1,352,500 NET EARNINGS $ 2,128,400 $ 1,274,200 $ 4,390,600 $ 2,212,900 BASIC AND DILUTED EARNINGS PER SHARE: Basic $ 0.52 $ 0.31 $ 1.07 $ 0.54 Diluted $ 0.52 $ 0.31 $ 1.07 $ 0.54 DIVIDENDS PER SHARE $ 0.00 $ 0.09 $ 0.00 $ 0.27 WEIGHTED AVERAGE NUMBER OF COMMON AND EQUIVALENT SHARES OUTSTANDING: Basic 4,087,268 4,079,916 4,087,686 4,074,355 Diluted 4,090,011 4,084,863 4,090,053 4,079,833 EDC will host its third quarter fiscal 2018 results Investor Call including a live Q&A webcast on Tuesday, January 16, 2018, at 2 PM CT (3 PM ET).
