Analysis of AHIP Reports* \nFurther, you may be harder to insure now compared to when you first bought your policy, so you'll have a harder time replacing it. \n\"When I get the details on these contracts, they offered generous benefits that are mis-priced — that's where the increase in premiums are coming from,\" said Phil Jackson, an insurance planner at ValMark Financial Group in Akron, Ohio. \nIf your rates are going up, there are a few options to consider before abandoning ship, according to Rita Cheng, a certified financial planner and CEO of Blue Ocean Global Wealth in Rockville, Maryland: Call your insurer. If the cost of the coverage is going up by 25 percent, yet you can afford only 10 percent, find out what that will get you. Get everything in writing. Consider freezing your current benefit. That helps keep your premium costs low, rather than losing your coverage altogether. Know where to make tweaks. A modification to your daily or monthly benefit amount may be doable, as is switching your inflation protection if you have it. Don't cut your home care . Advisors say elderly clients prefer receiving care in the comfort and familiarity of their home. \nFinancial advisors are also recommending life insurance policies that combine long-term care benefits. This may make sense if you already need the life insurance in the first place. \n\"The client will either get the long-term care benefits or the death benefit,\" said Jackson of ValMark. \"They have that confidence that they will receive something.\" A new approach \nGoing forward, individuals ought to think about what they want out of long-term care, including how they'd like to receive their care and how long they expect to be in a care facility. \nSee below for details on assisted living costs. \n\"Advisors need to talk about the logistics of aging with clients and documenting that — where will you move, who will help you make decisions,\" said Carolyn McClanahan, a physician and director of financial planning at Life Planning Partners in Jacksonville, Florida. \nShe has developed a tool called Whealthcare Planning to help clients figure out how they would prefer to be cared for in old age and how they would want to pay for it. \nBy addressing your wishes early in the planning process, you'll have a greater opportunity to prepare for the cost of care. \n\"Many people don't understand that when they're old, especially if they have cognitive issues, it's unsafe and very expensive to live at home,\" said McClanahan. \n\"But if you make the kids promise never to move you to a nursing home, they will spend every last dime not moving you,\" she said. \nMore from Your Money Your Future: ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-23T19:20:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-23T19:35:11.019+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
