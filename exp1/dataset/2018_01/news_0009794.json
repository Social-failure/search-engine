The first two approved CAR-T treatments for other cancers from Novartis and Gilead Sciences were priced at $475,000 and $373,000, respectively, for the one-time treatments.\nAs bluebird progresses toward a portfolio of potentially game-changing commercial treatments, Leschly said one of his overriding principles is: “Don’t do stupid shortsighted stuff.”\n“We haven’t done anything yet,” Leschly said. “We need to deliver products to patients.”\n(This version corrects name of multiple myeloma drug to bb2121 from b2121 in fourth and fifth paragraphs)\nReporting by Bill Berkrot; Editing by Tom Brown and Bill Trott\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-09T20:44:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-09T21:04:09.011+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
