I don’t want my departure, ahead of a new challenge in my professional career, to be a goodbye but a see you soon. Here I leave a unique, different club, and one I will never forget.” Reporting by Rik Sharma, editing by Ed Osmond and Christian Radnedge", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-29T18:12:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-29T18:33:40.007+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
