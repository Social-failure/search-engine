I just ignored the whole Olympics aspect of it and skated how I know how.” \nNagasu, meanwhile, failed to stick her signature jump in a nervous start to what she hopes will be Olympic redemption but still recovered to challenge Tennell. \nThe 24-year-old wept openly after being overlooked for the 2014 American team for Sochi, despite finishing third at the U.S. championships that year. \nFour years after that crushing disappointment, Nagasu entered this year’s championships with the distinction of being only the second American after Tonya Harding to land a triple Axel in international competition.

She regrouped, however, and was rewarded with the highest technical score of the night. \n“I think I did a great job. To go down in history is all I’ve ever wanted,” said Nagasu, who makes no secret of her desire to atone for 2014. \n“I wish I had the mental ability of (multiple gold medal-winning swimmer) Michael Phelps but I think my journey has been about getting up... I‘m so proud to still be here today.” Slideshow (5 Images) \nTennell and Nagasu are well clear of third-placed Karen Wang on 69.48, with triple national champion Ashley Wagner languishing down in fifth place on 65.94. \n“I’ve head a really mental season, I‘m not going to lie about that,” said Wagner, referring to her recent mediocre form. \n“This was solid. You can lose an event in the short program and my main focus was to get through this, not get too far behind and get myself a close enough distance to make a real killing in the long.” \nThe ladies’ event concludes on Friday with the long program. \nThe first three finishers are not guaranteed of selection, as Nagasu discovered in 2014, but know a strong finish will be hard to ignore.
