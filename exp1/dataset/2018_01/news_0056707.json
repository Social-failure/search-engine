For the year ended December 31, 2017, the Company reported net income of $5.7 million, or $1.05 per diluted share as compared to net income of $5.5 million, or $1.19 per diluted share, for the same period last year. The decrease in net income for both reported periods was mainly attributable to the Company’s adjustment to deferred tax assets resulting from the recognition of the newly enacted Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (“Tax Act”) and merger-related costs associated with the merger of Community Bank of Bergen County (“Community Bank”), NJ with and into the Bank. Earnings per share for both periods were also impacted by 1,249,999 additional common shares issued in the second quarter of 2017 in connection with an approximately $28.2 million capital raise.\nThe Company’s net income, adjusted for merger-related expenses and the impact from the Tax Act on income tax expenses, increased $608 thousand, or 39.9%, to $2.1 million, or $0.35 per basic and diluted share, for the quarter ended December 31, 2017, as compared to the same period last year.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017, the Company’s net income, adjusted for merger-related expenses and the impact from the Tax Act on income tax expenses, increased $2.2 million, or 39.4%, to $7.7 million, or $1.42 per basic and diluted common share, for the year ended December 31, 2017, as compared to last year.\nIn December 2017, the Company recognized a decrease in deferred tax assets as a result of the Tax Act and the change in federal income tax rate from 34% to the newly enacted 21%, which resulted in additional income tax expense of $942 thousand. Also, the Company realized $705 thousand and $1.2 million in merger-related expenses for the three months ended December 31, 2017 and for the year ended December 31, 2017, respectively.\n“I am very excited to report another strong year of financial performance for Sussex Bancorp as our business lines continue to drive outstanding results. For 2017, each of our major business units grew in excess of 15% with commercial loans leading the way, growing at 23%. The business line growth in conjunction with continued improvement in efficiency has driven strong growth in operating results of approximately 40% for the fourth quarter and fiscal year of 2017,” said Anthony Labozzetta, President and Chief Executive Officer of Sussex Bank.\nMr. Labozzetta also stated, “We are very excited at the tremendous opportunities ahead of us. In January, we completed our merger and began our partnership with Community Bank. Also, the new Tax Act will provide us a financial lift for both the short and long run. The Tax Act provides an opportunity to prudently accelerate our strategic plan initiatives through the hiring of additional staff to grow our businesses, invest in technology, and expand risk management and infrastructure to support our growth. We were optimistic and excited about the future of our Company prior to the signing of the Tax Act and now even more so.”\nFinancial Performance\nNet Income. For the quarter ended December 31, 2017, the Company reported net income of $513 thousand, or $0.09 per basic and diluted share, as compared to net income of $1.5 million, or $0.33 per basic share and $0.32 per diluted share, for the same period last year. The decrease in net income for the quarter ended December 31, 2017 was driven by a $1.2 million, or 153.0%, increase in income tax provision mostly due to the newly enacted Tax Act and an increase in non-interest expenses of $1.1 million largely due to merger-related expenses of $705 thousand. The aforementioned decrease in net income was partially offset by a $1.3 million, or 19.5%, increase in net interest income resulting from strong average loan and average interest bearing deposit growth of 18.4% and 19.5%, respectively, which is partially offset by a $491 thousand increase in overall interest expense partly related to the $15.0 million private placement of subordinated notes completed in the fourth quarter of 2016 and an increase in interest expense related to growth and higher costs for interest bearing deposits.\nThe Company’s net income, adjusted for merger and impact on income tax expenses from the Tax Act, increased $608 thousand, or 39.9%, to $2.1 million, or $0.35 per basic and diluted share, for the quarter ended December 31, 2017, as compared to the same period last year.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017, the Company reported net income of $5.7 million, or $1.05 per diluted share, or a 3.0% increase, as compared to net income of $5.5 million, or $1.19 per diluted share, for the same period last year. The increase in net income for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017 was largely due to an increase in net interest income of $4.7 million, which was partially offset by an increase in non-interest expenses of $3.0 million and income tax expenses from the Tax Act of $942 thousand. The increase in non-interest expenses was largely due to an $1.7 million increase in salaries and employee benefits and merger-related expenses of $1.2 million. Excluding merger-related expenses, net income increased $1.2 million, or 21.5%, for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017.\nThe Company’s net income, adjusted for merger-related expenses and income tax expenses from the Tax Act, increased $2.2 million, or 39.4%, to $7.7 million, or $1.42 per basic and diluted share, for the year ended December 31, 2017, as compared to last year.\nNet Interest Income . Net interest income on a fully tax equivalent basis increased $1.3 million, or 19.9%, to $8.0 million for the fourth quarter of 2017, as compared to $6.7 million for the same period in 2016. The increase in net interest income was largely due to a $128.1 million, or 16.1%, increase in average interest earning assets, principally loans receivable, which increased $125.1 million, or 18.4%. The net interest margin increased by 11 basis points to 3.46% for the fourth quarter of 2017, as compared to the same period in 2016. The net interest margin increase was partially attributed to $178 thousand in prepayment penalties, an increase of $135 thousand, or 319.5%, as compared to the same period in 2016.\nNet interest income on a fully tax equivalent basis increased $4.9 million, or 19.8%, to $29.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to $24.8 million for the same period in 2016. Included in the increase in net interest income was $635 thousand in prepayment penalties on $54.9 million of commercial loans, an increase of $544 thousand, or 601.2%, as compared to the same period in 2016. The net interest margin increased by 2 basis points to 3.39% for the year ended December 31, 2017, as compared to the same period in 2016.\nProvision for Loan Losses. Provision for loan losses increased $222 thousand to $459 thousand for the fourth quarter of 2017, as compared to $237 thousand for the same period in 2016.\nProvision for loan losses increased $295 thousand, or 22.9%, to $1.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, as compared to the same period in 2016.\nNon-interest Income. Non-interest income increased $256 thousand, or 15.0%, to $2.0 million for the fourth quarter of 2017, as compared to the same period last year. The increase was principally due to growth of $227 thousand in insurance commissions and fees relating to Tri-State Insurance Agency, $62 thousand in service fees on deposit accounts and $61 thousand in bank owned life insurance. The aforementioned was partly offset by a reduction in gain on sales of securities of approximately $143 thousand.\nThe Company’s non-interest income increased $456 thousand, or 5.8%, to $8.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to the same period last year. The increase was principally due to growth of $530 thousand in insurance commissions and fees relating to Tri-State Insurance Agency and an increase of $214 thousand in bank owned life insurance, due to an increase in investments in bank owned life insurance. The aforementioned were partly offset by a reduction in gain on sales of securities of approximately $453 thousand.\nNon-interest Expense. The Company’s non-interest expenses increased $1.1 million, or 19.1%, to $6.8 million for the fourth quarter of 2017, as compared to the same period last year. The increase for the fourth quarter of 2017, as compared to the same period in 2016, was largely due to expenses of $705 thousand related to the acquisition of Community Bank and increases in salaries and employee benefits of $377 thousand and in professional fees of $177 thousand. The aforementioned were partly offset by reductions in expenses and write-downs related to foreclosed real estate of $156 thousand.\nThe Company’s non-interest expenses increased $3.0 million, or 13.4%, to $25.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to the same period last year. The increase for the year ended December 31, 2017, as compared to the same period in 2016, was largely due to increases in salaries and employee benefits of $1.7 million, merger-related expenses of $1.2 million, professional fees of $385 thousand, and other expenses of $270 thousand and was partly offset by decreases of $245 thousand in FDIC assessment fees and $175 in expenses and write-downs related to foreclosed real estate.\nThe increase in salaries and employee benefits for the fourth quarter and twelve months ended December 31, 2017 as compared to the same periods in 2016 was largely due to an increase in personnel to support the Company’s growth.\nIncome Tax Expense. The Company’s income tax expenses increased $1.2 million, or 153.0% to $2.0 million for the fourth quarter of 2017, as compared to the same period last year. The Company’s income tax expenses increased $1.7 million, or 58.4%, to $4.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to the same period last year.\nThe increase in income tax expense for the quarter and year ended December 31, 2017, was directly impacted by the recognition of the newly enacted Tax Act.\nFinancial Condition\nAt December 31, 2017, the Company’s total assets were $979.4 million, an increase of $130.7 million, or 15.4%, as compared to total assets of $848.7 million at December 31, 2016. The increase in total assets was largely driven by growth in loans receivable of $125.4 million, or 18.0%.\nTotal loans receivable, net of unearned income, increased $125.4 million, or 18.0%, to $820.7 million at December 31, 2017, as compared to $695.3 million at December 31, 2016. During the twelve months ended December 31, 2017, the Company had $165.3 million in commercial loan production, which was partly offset by $54.9 million in commercial loan payoffs.\nThe Company’s total deposits increased $101.6 million, or 15.4%, to $762.5 million at December 31, 2017, from $660.9 million at December 31, 2016. The growth in deposits was primarily due to an increase in interest bearing deposits of $87.8 million, or 16.6%, at December 31, 2017, as compared to December 31, 2016. Included in the aforementioned deposit total is $89.9 million with a cost of 0.69% attributed to our branch in Oradell, New Jersey, which opened in the beginning of March 2016, an increase of $29.9 million or 49.9% from December 31, 2016. Additionally, the Company’s wholesale deposits increased $46.0 million, or 54.4%, to $130.6 million at December 31, 2017 from $84.6 at December 31, 2016.\nAt December 31, 2017, the Company’s total stockholders’ equity was $94.2 million, an increase of $34.1 million when compared to December 31, 2016. The increase was largely due to the capital raise of approximately $28.2 million and net income for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017. The Company completed the capital raise on June 21, 2017 which was the primary driver in the book value increase of 23.1% from $12.67 to $15.59. At December 31, 2017, the leverage, Tier I risk-based capital, total risk-based capital and common equity Tier I capital ratios for the Bank were 11.87%, 14.28%, 15.19% and 14.28%, respectively, all in excess of the ratios required to be deemed “well-capitalized.”\nAsset and Credit Quality\nThe ratio of NPAs, which include non-accrual loans, loans 90 days past due and still accruing, troubled debt restructured loans currently performing in accordance with renegotiated terms and foreclosed real estate, to total assets decreased to 0.94% at December 31, 2017 from 1.10% at December 31, 2016.
