But, if and when he does play in the team, he needs time. He has been out an awful long time. \n“It was such a long period of time out that he cannot be expected to hit his top form immediately. But it is very important to have him back, and to have his influence not just as a player but as a person and a human being.” \nAllardyce said left back Luke Garbutt will also return to the squad after he was frozen out by former manager Ronald Koeman. \nLeighton Baines is still struggling with a calf injury and Allardyce is keen to give the 24-year-old a chance in the first-team. \n“We’ve put him (Garbutt) in the squad, he’s been out of it since the start of the season so we’ve put him in there to have a look at him and time will tell on how we think he progresses,” the manager added. \nEverton, ninth in the league table, are without a win in their last six matches.
