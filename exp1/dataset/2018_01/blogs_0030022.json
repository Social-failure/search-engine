If that's not a sign of something going mainstream, I don't know what is.\nAs a financial advisor, I've found it interesting these past months to talk about bitcoin in a professional setting. When I do, I always explain that, no matter how exciting the \"crypto-hysteria\" may seem, it is speculative. Ultimately, one must remember the intimate relationship between risk and reward. Ignore it, and you could find yourself disappointed or, even worse, broke.\nMost of my clients don't know this, but I've personally owned bitcoin since 2014. My stash sits securely in my digital wallet, untouched since the day it was deposited there. Back then, I split the cost of a glorified computer — called a \"miner\" — with a childhood friend, and this machine generated us a finite amount of digital money. So long before your grandma knew what a bitcoin was, I've been riding this roller coaster.\nMore from Investor Toolkit:\nSo you're a 401(k) \"millionairess.\" Now what?\nIt's time for financial services firms to regain consumer trust\nDon't put all your financial eggs in one investment basket\nHowever, I've been keeping mum about my position in bitcoin for two reasons. First and foremost, from both an advisory and compliance standpoint, this subject is under strict regulatory scrutiny; it's a bad look in either department to rant and rave about speculative trends. Second, I had not quite figured out how to use my bitcoin experience in a way that would be constructive for my clients. The last thing I'd want is for my story to unduly color their biases. But now, more than a few years in, I think I've extracted the lesson to share with them and everyone else.\nFrom the beginning, I thought about our miner as form of entertainment — never as an investment. The cost of the machine was something I could afford, and I was excited to embark on another adventure with an old friend (who happens to be a neuroscientist with a knack for these things). I cut the check like I had just left an ATM in Vegas, prepared to hand over my money to either hit it big or crap out. I'd be lucky to come out on top, but most importantly, I never play with more money than I am willing to lose.\nYour Wealth: Weekly advice on managing your money Sign up to get Your Wealth\nJob Industry Advertising/Marketing Automotive Communications/PR Construction/Manufacturing Education Finance/Banking/Insurance Legal Media/Entertainment Medical/Health Care Mining/Oil/Gas/Utilities Gov't/Non-Profit Real Estate Retail Technology/IT Transportation/Shipping Travel/Hospitality Other Submit Please enter a valid email address Get this delivered to your inbox, and more info about about our products and service. Privacy Policy . We have arrived at a point where bitcoin's entertainment factor has masked the reality that it's risky business. To jump on the roller coaster today, the average American investor would not likely be playing with the kind of money you bring to the penny slots. They'd be playing with their savings or student loan payments. And most lack the education about their own financial situation to put this into context. It's this inability to separate what's entertaining from what makes sense that gets people into serious trouble.\nYou see, even though cryptocurrencies are \"new,\" their risks are not. Therefore, the same breakdown between risk and reward that could plague any investor would apply. So now, if you ask me for my impression on cryptocurrency, I'll tell you my story: That I'm keeping my arms and legs inside the ride at all times — but I'm not going to decide whether you should buy a ticket.\n— By Douglas A.
