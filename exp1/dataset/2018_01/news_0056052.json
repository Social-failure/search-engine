It is located in the Sam Houston Forest and includes training gyms, a dance studio, housing for 300 athletes, coaches and administrators and a dining hall. \nFour-times Olympic gold medallist and Texas native Simone Biles said this month she was sexually abused by Nassar and it would be too traumatic to return to Karolyi Ranch as she worked toward her goal of competing in the 2020 Tokyo Olympics. \n“Those athletes, as well as all Texans, deserve to know that no stone is left unturned to ensure that the allegations are thoroughly vetted and the perpetrators and enablers of any such misconduct are brought to justice,” said Abbott, a Republican. \nNassar also worked for Michigan State University and Michigan’s attorney general named a special prosecutor on Saturday to lead an investigation of the school. \nFederal legislation to protect young amateur athletes from sexual abuse, spurred by the gymnastics scandal, moved a step closer to enactment on Monday when the U.S. House of Representatives passed the bill.
