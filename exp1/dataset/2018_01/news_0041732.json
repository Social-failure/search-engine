(NYSE:PX) today reported fourth-quarter net income of $33 million and diluted earnings per share of $0.11. These results include transaction costs of $14 million after-tax related to the proposed merger with Linde AG and a net income tax charge of $394 million related to the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (“Tax Reform”). The net tax charge reflects the company’s best estimate of Tax Reform and may be adjusted in future periods as required. The impact of these charges was $1.41 of diluted earnings per share. Excluding these two items, adjusted net income was $441 million and diluted earnings per share was $1.52, up 9% and 8%, respectively versus prior year.\nPraxair’s sales in the fourth quarter were $2,953 million, 12% above the prior-year quarter. After adjusting for positive currency translation and cost pass-through, sales grew 8%, driven by price attainment and higher volumes across all geographic segments and end-markets.\nReported operating profit in the fourth quarter was $636 million, 6% above the prior-year quarter. Excluding transaction costs, adjusted operating profit was $653 million, 9% above prior-year quarter. Reported and adjusted operating profit margins were 21.5% and 22.1%, respectively. EBITDA margin was 32.3% and adjusted EBITDA margin was 32.9%.\nThe company generated strong fourth-quarter operating cash flow of $836 million, 28% of sales. After capital expenditures of $339 million, free cash flow was $497 million, up 57% over the prior-year quarter. The company paid $226 million in dividends and decreased net debt by $247 million, sequentially.\nFor full-year 2017, sales of $11,437 million were up 9% above prior year. Diluted earnings per share were $4.32 and on an adjusted basis, diluted earnings per share were $5.85, up 7% versus prior year.\nFull-year operating cash flow was $3,041 million, or 27% of sales. Free cash flow, defined as operating cash flow less capital expenditures, was $1,730 million. The company paid dividends of $901 million and reduced net debt by $608 million.\nCommenting on the financial results, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Steve Angel said, “We had a strong finish to 2017 with 8% EPS growth and record free cash flow in the fourth quarter. The Praxair team delivered on our strategy by successfully executing the project backlog, winning several new onsite projects, and operating safely and efficiently. We have enhanced our business portfolio by increasing exposure to more resilient end-markets while remaining well positioned for the industrial recovery. All of this was accomplished while making significant progress toward our merger with Linde.\n“Looking ahead to 2018, we will maintain our focus and leverage the cyclical recovery occurring across several core geographies and end-markets,” continued Angel. “I remain confident in our ability to grow our project backlog with new contract wins, especially in Asia and the U.S. Gulf Coast. And recent tax reform should help stimulate new capital investment in the United States and thus provide additional growth opportunities in our largest market.\n“In the second half of 2018, I look forward to the completion of the merger between Praxair and Linde, which will bring together our complementary strengths and highly talented people.”\nFor first-quarter 2018, Praxair expects diluted earnings per share in the range of $1.53 to $1.58, excluding transaction costs related to the proposed merger. The company’s effective tax rate is estimated to be in the range of 23% to 25%.\nFollowing is additional detail on fourth-quarter 2017 results by segment.\nIn North America, fourth-quarter sales were $1,542 million, 9% above the prior-year quarter, excluding currency translation.

(b) On December 22, 2017 the U.S. government enacted the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (Tax Reform). This comprehensive tax legislation significantly revises the U.S. corporate income tax by, among other things, lowering corporate income tax rates, implementing a territorial tax system and imposing a repatriation tax on deemed repatriated earnings of foreign subsidiaries. As a result, Praxair’s fourth-quarter net income includes a net income tax charge of $394 million comprised of the following: $467 million charge for deemed repatriation of accumulated foreign earnings, $260 million charge for foreign withholding taxes related to anticipated repatriation of foreign earnings and $333 million benefit for the revaluation of deferred tax liabilities from 35 percent to the 21 percent tax rate. This represents the Company's current best estimate of the tax reform. As new information becomes available, the Company may update this estimate. (c) Pension settlement charges were recorded in the third quarter of 2017 related to lump sum benefit payments made from an international pension plan and in the third quarter of 2016 related to lump sum benefit payments made from the U.S. supplemental pension plan. (d) Charges in the 2016 third quarter related to the cost reduction program and other charges. (e) Charge to interest expense in the 2016 first quarter related to a bond redemption.\nPRAXAIR, INC.
