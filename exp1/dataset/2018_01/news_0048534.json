Total and Conoco Phillips did not respond immediately to emails seeking comment. \nAccording to the Senate motion, while Brass LNG’s bank account was intended to be held by the Central Bank of Nigeria, corporate records show it is with Keystone Bank. \nThe Senate documents said that the most recent deposit into the account was $648 million in September 2016 and that it currently holds $137 million. It did not provide detail on the discrepancy between the September 2016 deposit and the current balance. \nA Senate committee will examine investments into Brass LNG, returns for the federal government, whether due process was followed and the signatories to the bank account. It is due to report back in four weeks. \nAdding to challenges faced by investors, the Brass LNG project, which was to have annual capacity of 10 million tonnes, also suffered from a lack of dedicated gas reserves to underpin 20-year supply deals.
