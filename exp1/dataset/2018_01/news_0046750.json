(NYSE: CLF) today reported fourth-quarter and full-year results for the period ended December 31, 2017.\nFourth-quarter 2017 consolidated revenues were $601 million, compared to prior-year fourth-quarter revenues of $754 million. Cost of goods sold was $492 million, compared to $573 million reported in the fourth quarter of 2016.\nFor the fourth quarter of 2017, the Company recorded net income of $318 million, or $1.05 per diluted share, compared to net income of $81 million, or $0.34 per diluted share, recorded in the prior-year quarter.\nFor the fourth-quarter of 2017, adjusted EBITDA 1 was $129 million, compared to $174 million in the fourth quarter of 2016.\nFull-Year Consolidated Results\nFull-year 2017 consolidated revenues were $2.3 billion, compared to the prior year's revenues of $2.1 billion. Cost of goods sold was $1.8 billion, compared to $1.7 billion reported in 2016.\nFor the full-year 2017, the Company recorded net income of $371 million, or $1.28 per diluted share, compared to net income of $199 million, or $0.87 per diluted share, recorded in the prior year.\nFor the full-year 2017, adjusted EBITDA 1 was $513 million, compared to $374 million in 2016.\nAdjusted EBITDA 1 by Segment (in millions) U.S. Asia Pacific Corporate/ Iron Ore Iron Ore Other Total Q4 2017 Adjusted\nEBITDA 1 (in millions)\n$ 159.6 $ (3.4 ) $ (27.0 ) $ 129.2 2017 Adjusted\nEBITDA 1 (in millions)\n$ 559.4 $ 58.3 $ (104.9 ) $ 512.8 Lourenco Goncalves, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer, said: â€œCleveland-Cliffs delivered in 2017 strong and sustainable financial results, and that was exactly what I promised one year ago.

This new, more logical approach to business should provide us solid support to deliver even stronger results in 2018.\"\nU.S. Iron Ore\nThree Months Ended Year Ended December 31, December 31, 2017 2016 2017 2016 Volumes - In Thousands of Long Tons\nTotal sales volume 5,392 6,881 18,683 18,224 Total production volume 5,543 4,923 18,776 15,982 Sales Margin - In Millions\nRevenues from product sales and services $ 511.8 $ 579.0 $ 1,866.0 $ 1,554.5 Cost of goods sold and operating expenses 396.2 453.0 1,400.6 1,278.8 Sales margin $ 115.6 $ 126.0 $ 465.4 $ 275.7 Sales Margin - Per Long Ton\nRevenues from product sales and services* $ 83.38 $ 73.86 $ 88.03 $ 75.71 Cash cost of goods sold and operating expense rate 2 58.79 52.80 59.55 55.97 Depreciation, depletion and amortization 3.15 2.75 3.56 4.61 Cost of goods sold and operating expenses* 61.94 55.55 63.11 60.58 Sales margin $ 21.44 $ 18.31 $ 24.92 $ 15.13 *Excludes revenues and expenses related to domestic freight, which are offsetting and have no impact on sales margin. Revenues and expenses also exclude venture partner cost reimbursements. U.S. Iron Ore pellet sales volume in the fourth quarter of 2017 was 5.4 million long tons, a 22 percent decrease when compared with 6.9 million long tons sold in the fourth quarter of 2016. The decrease was a result of a stronger than historical shipping pace during the first nine months of 2017 leading to lower required fourth quarter shipments to meet full-year customer nominations, as well as the previously disclosed nomination reduction from a major customer.\nCash cost of goods sold and operating expense rate 2 in U.S. Iron Ore was $58.79 per long ton, up 11 percent from $52.80 per long ton in the prior year's fourth quarter. The increase was primarily driven by higher costs associated with maintenance and repairs, employee benefits, and energy rates.\nAsia Pacific Iron Ore\nThree Months Ended Year Ended December 31, December 31, 2017 2016 2017 2016 Volumes - In Thousands of Metric Tons\nTotal sales volume 2,049 2,937 9,812 11,642 Total production volume 2,203 3,264 10,113 11,839 Sales Margin - In Millions\nRevenues from product sales and services $ 89.1 $ 175.0 $ 464.2 $ 554.5 Cost of goods sold and operating expenses 96.1 119.5 420.0 440.9 Sales margin $ (7.0 ) $ 55.5 $ 44.2 $ 113.6 Sales Margin - Per Metric Ton\nRevenues from product sales and services* $ 42.61 $ 57.30 $ 45.31 $ 45.85 Cash cost of goods sold and operating expense rate 2 44.56 36.40 39.35 33.94 Depreciation, depletion and amortization 1.46 2.01 1.46 2.16 Cost of goods sold and operating expenses* 46.02 38.41 40.81 36.10 Sales margin $ (3.41 ) $ 18.89 $ 4.50 $ 9.75 *Excludes revenues and expenses related to freight, which are offsetting and have no impact on sales margin. Fourth-quarter 2017 Asia Pacific Iron Ore sales volume of 2.0 million metric tons decreased 30 percent from the prior-year quarter. The decrease was driven primarily by lower production volumes, a result of operational decisions reflecting current market conditions and quality ore availability.\nCash cost of goods sold and operating expense rate 2 in Asia Pacific Iron Ore was $44.56 per metric ton in the fourth quarter of 2017, a 22 percent increase from $36.40 in the prior-year quarter. This was primarily attributable to increased mining costs, driven by a change in the overall production plan resulting in a higher strip ratio. It was also driven by increased logistics and unfavorable exchange rate variances.\nOther Income Statement Items\nCliffs' fourth-quarter 2017 SG&A expenses were $28 million. This represents a 22 percent decrease when compared to the fourth-quarter 2016 expenses of $36 million. The decrease was driven primarily by reduced incentive compensation.\nCliffs' net interest expense during the fourth quarter was $29 million, a 35 percent decrease when compared to the fourth-quarter 2016 expense of $44 million, as a result of capital structure optimization initiatives executed by the Company during 2017.\nCliffs recognized a $246 million income tax benefit during the quarter. This was primarily attributable to a reversal of the valuation allowance on approximately $250 million of Alternate Minimum Tax (AMT) credit carryovers. With the passage of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 and corresponding repeal of the AMT, this amount will be refunded to Cliffs in cash over the next four tax years.\nDebt and Cash Flow\nTotal capital expenditures during the quarter were $77 million, which included sustaining capital, preliminary spending related to the Hot-Briquetted Iron (HBI) project, and the acquisition of certain real estate interests located in Nashwauk, Minnesota (Nashwauk) from Glacier Park Iron Ore Properties LLC (GPIOP). The purchased and leased properties include parcels that were formerly leased by GPIOP to Mesabi Metallics Company LLC, formerly known as Essar Steel Minnesota.\nCash and cash equivalents at the end of the fourth quarter of 2017 totaled $1.0 billion, compared to $323 million at the end of the fourth quarter of 2016. Total debt at the end of the fourth quarter of 2017 was $2.3 billion, versus $2.2 billion at the end of the fourth quarter of 2016. At the end of the fourth quarter of 2017, including the impact of the transactions related to the ownership of Tilden, Empire, and Nashwauk, Cliffs had net debt 3 of $1.3 billion, compared to $1.8 billion of net debt 3 at the end of the fourth quarter of 2016.\nSegment Outlook\nAfter evaluating current and anticipated future market conditions in connection with the remaining iron ore reserves at Cliffs' APIO, including quality and the current market price for the ore, the Company has decided to accelerate the projected time frame for the planned closure of mining operations in Australia, which will more than likely occur in 2018. Accordingly, the Company will no longer provide guidance related to this business segment.\n2018 Outlook Summary Per Long Ton Information U.S. Iron Ore Revenues from product sales and services (A) $97 - $102 Cost of goods sold and operating expense rate $69 - $74 Less: Freight expense rate (B) $7 Depreciation, depletion & amortization rate $4 Cash cost of goods sold and operating expense rate 2 $58 - $63 Sales volume (million long tons) 20 Production volume (million long tons) 20 (A) This expectation is based on the assumption that iron ore prices, steel prices, and pellet premiums will average for the remainder of 2018 their respective year-to-date averages. (B) Freight has an offsetting amount in revenue and has no impact on sales margin. U.S. Iron Ore Outlook (Long Tons)\nBased on the assumption that iron ore prices, steel prices, and pellet premiums will average for the remainder of 2018 their respective year-to-date averages, Cliffs would realize USIO revenue rates in the range of $97 to $102 per long ton.\nAs previously disclosed, for 2018 Cliffs expects full-year sales and production volumes of approximately 20 million long tons from its U.S. Iron Ore business. This compares to 18.7 million long tons of sales and 18.8 million long tons of production in 2017.\nCliffs' full-year 2018 U.S. Iron Ore cash cost of goods sold and operating expense 2 expectation is $58 - $63 per long ton, which compares to $60 per long ton for the full-year 2017.\nSG&A Expenses and Other Expectations\nFull-year 2018 SG&A expenses are expected to be approximately $115 million. Cliffs also notes that of the $115 million expectation, approximately $20 million is considered non-cash. The increase compared to 2017 is partially attributable to an accounting change related to the reclassification of certain Pension/OPEB components.\nThe Company's full-year 2018 interest expense is expected to be approximately $130 million, compared to $132 million recorded in 2017. Consolidated full-year 2018 depreciation, depletion and amortization is expected to be approximately $100 million, incurred ratably throughout the year.\nCapital Expenditures\nCliffs' 2018 capital spending expectations are:\nApproximately $85 million in sustaining capital Approximately $250 million toward the HBI project in Toledo, OH (fully funded with the December 2017 financing transactions) Approximately $50 million toward the upgrade of the Northshore mine to produce up to 3.5 million long tons of DR-grade pellets a year\nConference Call Information\nCleveland-Cliffs Inc. will host a conference call this morning, January 25, 2018, at 10 a.m. ET. The call will be broadcast live and archived on Cliffs' website: www.clevelandcliffs.com\nAbout Cleveland-Cliffs Inc.\nFounded in 1847, Cleveland-Cliffs Inc. is the largest and oldest independent iron ore mining company in the United States.
