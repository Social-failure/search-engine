Whether ramping M&A is 'real or imagined', it will help inject more optimism into telcos, they say, with smaller operators, including those with limited government ownership or more flexible governments, likely to gain from increased deals speculation. Overall they're positive on the sector which they think will do well in 2018 after two years of underperformance drove its valuations sharply down, making them relatively attractive. DB's top sector picks are Vodafone, Telenet, KPN, Telefonica and Liberty Global. (Helen Reid) BREXIT WATCHERS, WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF BLANKFEIN'S LATEST TWEET? (0947 GMT) The CEO of Goldman Sachs, which has yet to announce precise plans as to how it will move staff from the City of London to Frankfurt and Paris post-Brexit, has just delivered some high praise to France's Macron after a meeting in Versailles. (Reuters was there:) \"Feels like a new day has dawned in France,\" Lloyd Blankfein tweeted, leaving Brexit watchers speculating whether this is a hint as to where the bulk of the London jobs will go. Last October, the CEO caused some English eyebrows to rise with this tweet: \"Just left Frankfurt. Great meetings, great weather, really enjoyed it. Good, because I'll be spending a lot more time there. #Brexit\" (Julien Ponthus and Helen Reid) OPENING SNAPSHOT: DAX AT NEW RECORD, STRONG POUND WEAKENS FTSE (0809 GMT) As expected European shares have opened in positive territory with the pan-regional STOXX 600 index edging up 0.3 percent. The outstanding mover however is the DAX. The main German stock index has hit a fresh all-time high and is up 0.8 percent, while Britain's FTSE looks the weakest among big European indexes after the pound reached a post-Brexit vote high. (Danilo Masoni) WHAT YOU NEED TO KNOW (0749 GMT) European shares are set for a strong start in the wake of the rally, which took place in Asia and on Wall Street following the deal to end the U.S. government shutdown. After yesterday’s M&A-fuelled session, there is little corporate news at this stage but faith in “global synchronised growth” should continue lifting indexes to new highs. Among possible movers is Sky: Britain's competition regulator said Rupert Murdoch buying all of Sky was not in the public interest because it would give the media mogul too much influence. Also EasyJet said recent reductions in capacity by competitors in the industry were contributing to a positive trading environment, as revenues improved in the first quarter. Still in the industry, Wizz Air is keen on Alitalia but only for short, medium-haul routes.

There could be victims in Europe too, such as Germany's SMA Solar Technology , which develops photovoltaic system technology. \"This could bother SMA's already difficult US business furthermore. SMA hosts CMD Friday maybe giving some insight soon,\" a Frankfurt-based trader said. Another trader said also shares in Solarworld, REC Silicon, Solar A/S , Soitec and Solar-Fabrik could be under pressure following Trump's move.
