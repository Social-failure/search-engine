His help for us has been precious,” PD leader Matteo Renzi said in an interview published on Monday in the Quotidiano Nazionale newspaper chain.\nPadoan has won plaudits within the European Union for his handling of a job which has often put him at odds with European Commission officials as he has sought special budget dispensation for heavily indebted Italy.\nUnder his watch, the country has emerged from the most punishing recession since World War Two, while employment has risen. Critics say Italy is still underperforming its eurozone peers and has failed to halt rising debt levels.\nThere was no immediate comment from the economy ministry.\nIn an interview with Corriere della Sera newspaper published on Sunday, Padoan said he would consider running for parliament if he were asked to do so.\nReporting by Massimiliano Di Giorgio and Giselda Vagnoni; Writing by Crispian Balmer,; Editing by Gavin Jones and Ed Osmond\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-01-08T19:46:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-09T17:00:40.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
