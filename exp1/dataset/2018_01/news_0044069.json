The overall sales increase for the quarter reflects a 0.9% increase from acquisition-related volume and favorable foreign currency translation of 0.8%. Organic growth, excluding these factors, was 8.0% in the quarter. Net income for the quarter increased 28.5% to $31.0 million from $24.1 million, and earnings per share rose 29.5% to $0.79 per share, compared with $0.61 per share in the prior year quarter. Year-over-year EPS growth included a $0.02 per share net tax benefit primarily attributed to the combined impact of deferred tax remeasurement, transition tax, and tax rate reduction resulting from the recently enacted U.S. federal tax reform.\nFor the six months ended December 31, 2017, sales were $1.35 billion, an increase of 9.3% compared with $1.23 billion in the same period last year. Net income increased to $64.7 million from $51.5 million, and earnings per share increased 26.1% to $1.65 per share from $1.31 per share, last year.\nCommenting on the results, Applied’s President & Chief Executive Officer Neil A. Schrimsher said, “We are off to an exciting start to the calendar year and our fiscal year second-half, celebrating 95 years of leadership in industrial distribution and further strengthening our position with the definitive agreement to acquire specialty flow control provider FCX Performance, Inc. Our solid second quarter results reflect broad-based execution across our business groups and a productive economic market environment.”\nOutlook\n“In light of recent performance, U.S. tax reform and continued favorable industrial markets, we are raising our full-year earnings per share guidance to a range between $3.40 and $3.50 per share, on sales which are anticipated to be 6% to 7% higher year-over-year. Revised guidance includes approximately $0.11 EPS benefit from U.S. tax reform.”\nThe Company also announced that the U.S. Federal Trade Commission has granted early termination of the waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act with respect to the pending acquisition of FCX Performance, Inc. The proposed acquisition, announced on January 9, 2018, is expected to close on January 31, 2018. Mr. Schrimsher added, “We will provide further guidance to include the partial year impact of results from the acquisition of FCX in conjunction with announcing the close of the transaction.”\nDividend\nThe Company’s Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.30 per common share, an increase of $0.01 per common share over the prior quarter. The dividend is payable on February 28, 2018, to shareholders of record on February 15, 2018.\nMr. Schrimsher concluded, “We continue to strengthen our differentiated industrial distribution capabilities, including our critical core products offering, expanding value-added services, leadership in engineered fluid power solutions, growing geographic reach, and channels to market. Applied is well-positioned as the technical MRO distribution leader, and we are committed to generating profitable growth and enhancing value for all our stakeholders.”\nShare Repurchases\nDuring the quarter, the Company purchased 145,800 shares of its common stock in open market transactions at an average share price of $61.84 for a total of $9.0 million. Fiscal year to date, the Company has purchased 393,300 shares for a total of $22.8 million.

An actual valuation of inventory under the LIFO method can only be made at the end of each year based on the inventory levels and costs at that time. Accordingly, interim LIFO calculations are based on management's estimates of expected year-end inventory levels and costs and are subject to the final year-end LIFO inventory determination.\n(2) During the first quarter of fiscal 2018, we early adopted Accounting Standards Update No. 2017-07, Improving the Presentation of Net Periodic Pension Cost and Net Periodic Postretirement Benefit Cost. As a result of this adoption, the condensed statement of consolidated income for the three months and six months ended December 31, 2016 has been restated resulting in a decrease in selling, distribution and administrative expenses and increasing other income, net of $0.2 million and $0.4 million respectively; resulting in an increase to operating income for the same amount.\n(3) On December 22, 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act was enacted in the U.S., making significant changes to U.S. tax law. In the quarter ended December 31, 2017, the Company revised its estimated annual effective tax rate to reflect the change in the federal statutory rate to a blended statutory rate for the annual period of 28.1%. We recognized a provisional amount for the one-time transition tax of $3.9 million, which is included as a component of income tax expense in the condensed statements of consolidated income for the three months and six months ending December 31, 2017. We also remeasured certain deferred assets and liabilities based on the rates at which they are expected to reverse in the current fiscal year and the future. The provisional amount recorded related to the remeasurement of our deferred tax balance was not material to the Company's condensed consolidated financial statements.\n(4) On January 9, 2018, the Company announced it has reached a definitive agreement to acquire FCX Performance, Inc., a distributor of specialty process flow control products and services based in Columbus, Ohio, for approximately $768 million. The deal is expected to close on January 31, 2018. The transaction will be financed with a new credit facility comprised of a $780,000 Term Loan A and $250,000 revolver, effective with the transaction closing.\nAPPLIED INDUSTRIAL TECHNOLOGIES, INC.
