There were no reports of violence.\nThere are about 700,000 Aborigines in a population of 23 million in Australia, whose descendants date back about 50,000 years before British colonizers arrived. They suffer disproportionately high rates of suicide, alcohol abuse, domestic violence and imprisonment.\nProtesters called for a treaty between indigenous and non-indigenous Australians, recognition in the constitution, and an end to inequality. Protesters want the date of Australia Day to be changed, or abolished altogether.\nWhether to change the date of Australia Day has been a subject of debate for many years, as has whether to change the Australian flag, which includes the British Union Jack.\nPrime Minister Malcolm Turnbull ruled out a change of flag.\n”That’s the one they have on their backpacks when they’re traveling overseas, that’s the flag that our soldiers have on their shoulder patches, that is our flag,” he told reporters.\n“So, I think the Australian flag will be flying over Parliament House long after all of us have shuffled off the stage of history.”\nReporting by Alana Schetzer; Editing by Nick Macfie\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-26T09:43:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-26T09:53:38.018+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
