REUTERS/Toru Hanai/File Photo Manufacturers in areas such as steel/nonferrous metals and chemicals, and metal production machinery led the gain.\nThe index matched the high reached in January 2007, around the time a booming economy allowed the BOJ to end a previous spell of quantitative easing and zero interest rates. The index is expected to remain unchanged over the next three months.\nBOJ Governor Haruhiko Kuroda is expected to reassure markets at this week’s policy-setting meeting that the central bank has no imminent plan to whittle down its huge monetary stimulus until its 2 percent inflation target is achieved.\nIn the Reuters Tankan, the service-sector sentiment index slipped to 33 in January from 34 in the previous month, with the information/communications industry falling from previous highs.\nThe service-sector index is expected to fall to 29 in April.\nThe BOJ’s latest tankan showed last month that big manufacturers’ confidence improved for a fifth straight quarter in December to hit an 11-year high, a sign of the economy’s broadening recovery on solid external demand and hefty corporate profits.\nThe Reuters Tankan’s sentiment indexes subtract the percentage of companies saying conditions are poor from those saying conditions are good. A positive number means optimists outnumber pessimists.\nReporting by Tetsushi Kajimoto; Editing by Eric Meijer\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-01-22T07:11:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-22T05:47:39.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
