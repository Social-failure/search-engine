After two years, only about 7 percent of these patients were still alive, compared with 31 percent of the people who received combined chemotherapy and radiation.\nBlack patients were 20 percent less likely than white patients to receive chemotherapy and radiation, the study found.\nPatients from communities where more than one in five residents lacked a high school degree had 15 percent lower odds of getting this combination therapy.\nAt the same time, men were 40 percent more likely to get chemo and radiation than women.\nThe survival benefit associated with combination therapy persisted even after accounting for factors like age, sex, race, income, and individual tumor characteristics.\nOne limitation of the study is that researchers lacked data on the exact cause of death. It’s possible the survival benefits of cancer treatment might be influenced by other competing risks of mortality in this elderly population, the authors note.\nSome patients also might have rejected treatment when it was offered to them, either out of concerns about side effects or for other reasons.\n“There are several reasons related to socioeconomic factors,” said Dr. Chris Murray, director of the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation at the University of Washington in Seattle.\n“In many cases, African Americans are less likely to have the financial means to seek medical care, such as transportation and some out of pocket expenses, although they are covered by Medicare,” Murray, who wasn’t involved in the study, said by email.\nTreatment disparities in the study might be explained in part by differences in cultural or community beliefs about how aggressively to attack tumors in old age, said Dr. Veena Shankaran of the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center in Seattle.\n“Many studies have shown that black patients have less access to cancer care and worse cancer outcomes than whites,” Shankaran, who wasn’t involved in the study, said by email. “This study suggests that the same is true in this elderly population of lung cancer patients.”\nGiven the better survival with chemotherapy and radiation, it makes sense to consider this option even for elderly patients, said Asal Johnson, a public health researcher at Stetson University in Florida who wasn’t involved in the study.\n“Elderly patients and their physicians should not be discouraged or timid to try available and recommended treatment options, including combined chemotherapy and radiation therapy,” Johnson said by email. “Part of the disparities between older and younger patients can be eliminated if both doctors and patients avoid making conventional assumptions about treatment regimens for the elderly.”\nSOURCE: bit.ly/2AHJtr0 Cancer, online January 8, 2019.\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-09T20:51:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-09T21:34:04.004+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
