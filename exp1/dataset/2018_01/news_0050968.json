Roberts, Breyer and Kagan regularly attend, as do justices appointed by the president who is speaking. Trump nominated Gorsuch a year ago.\nAmong the justices who will not be in the audience, Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito haven't attended a State of the Union speech in years. Alito last went in 2010, when he was captured on camera mouthing the words \"not true\" in response to President Barack Obama's criticism of the court's then new ruling in the Citizens United campaign finance case.\nJustice Anthony Kennedy's long-standing travel plans have him in California. Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg is in Rhode Island and Justice Sonia Sotomayor is in Panama.\n12:18 p.m.\nPresident Donald Trump's top economic and national security advisers help with his State of the Union address.\nA White House official says national security adviser H.R. McMaster and economic adviser Gary Cohn contributed to the speech Trump plans to deliver Tuesday night at the Capitol. The official says they were assisted by policy adviser Stephen Miller, staff secretary Rob Porter and other speechwriters.\nThe official stressed that the speech is the president's and that Trump has spent months giving his aides \"tidbits\" on lines he wants to use.\nThe White House has said Trump will use the speech to discuss economy and national security, as well as trade, immigration and infrastructure.\nThe official was not authorized to discuss internal White House deliberations by name and spoke on condition of anonymity.\n1:27 a.m.\nPresident Donald Trump will herald a robust economy and push for bipartisan congressional action on immigration in Tuesday's State of the Union address.\nThe speech marks the ceremonial kickoff of Trump's second year in office and is traditionally a president's biggest platform to speak to the nation. However, Trump has redefined presidential communications with his high-octane, filter-free Twitter account and there's no guarantee that the carefully crafted speech will resonate beyond his next tweet.\nStill, White House officials are hopeful the president can use the prime-time address to Congress and millions of Americans watching at home to take credit for a soaring economy. Trump argues that the tax overhaul he signed into law late last year has boosted business confidence and will lead companies to reinvest in the United States.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-30T19:25:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-30T20:02:53.003+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
