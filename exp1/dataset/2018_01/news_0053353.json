There is no evidence any information was misused, the researchers said. \nWeeks after word of the flaws first surfaced, Intel’s INTC, +10.55% choices about whom would receive advance warning continue to ripple through the security and tech industries. \nThe flaws were first identified in June by a member of Google’s Project Zero security team. Intel had planned to make the discovery public on Jan. 9 — people working to protect systems from hacks often hold off on announcements while fixes are devised — but sped up its timetable when the news became widely known on Jan. 3, a day after U.K. website the Register wrote about the flaws.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-28T18:37:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-28T20:39:47.006+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
