He also said the movie did better viewership than the company's \"The Crown\" season 2. \n\"We continue to think Netflix is in a strong position to capitalize on the shift to on demand viewing, the acceleration of cord cutting and the global demand for premium video content,\" he wrote. \"Netflix is in a unique position where it can afford to spend on acquiring and producing premium content and still have that spend be efficient given its global subscriber base.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-09T18:58:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-09T19:09:02.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
