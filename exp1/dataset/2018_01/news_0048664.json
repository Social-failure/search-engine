In recent years it has sought to widen the appeal of Islamic finance across Africa, home to a quarter of the world’s Muslims.\nThe ICD has advised several African governments on their plans to issue Islamic bonds, or sukuk, with Senegal, Nigeria and Ivory Coast among those that have tapped the market.\nLast month the ICD extended a $100 million financing facility to the Cairo-based African Export-Import Bank (Afreximbank).\nReporting by Bernardo Vizcaino; Editing by Eric Meijer\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-01-25T11:01:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-25T13:25:12.006+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
