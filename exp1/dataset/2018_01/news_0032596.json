Asked about when the government would declare an end to deflation, only one of 36 economists who responded saw it happening in the first half of this year, 12 expected it would be sometime during the second half, and eight predicted in the first six months in 2019.\nThe rest projected it would come after that -- and eight analysts thought it wouldn’t happen in the foreseeable future.\nWell over half the economists said such declaration would increase the likelihood that the government will press ahead with a planned - twice postponed - increase in the sales tax in October 2019.\n“The government will probably have to make the final decision in Autumn 2018 whether to hike the tax and if it decides to raise, they will use an end of deflation as a factor,” said Takeshi Minami, chief economist at Norinchukin Research Institute.\nAsked to choose up to three risks facing the Japanese economy this year, “North Korea” and “China’s economic outlook” tied for top risks. Next came “currency market movements” followed by the “Fed’s tightening impact” on financial and emerging markets.\n(For other stories from the Reuters global long-term economic outlook polls package see)\nPolling by Shaloo Shrivastava and Khushboo Mittal; Editing by Malcolm Foster and Simon Cameron-Moore\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-01-18T13:23:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-19T12:35:23.013+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
