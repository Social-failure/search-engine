The three main U.S. indexes retreated sharply on Monday from record levels last week, with the Dow falling more than 100 points, weighed down by Apple after a media report added to concerns about demand for the iPhone X. Meanwhile, Chinese iron ore futures fell to their weakest level in a month. The local share price index futures fell 0.5 percent or 27 points to 5,983, a 92.4-point discount to the underlying S&P/ASX 200 index close. The benchmark added 0.4 percent on Monday. New Zealand's benchmark S&P/NZX 50 index fell 16.540 points or 0.2 percent to 8,311.050 in early trade.
