The Boring Company says winners were picked at random. According to Lambert, he bought five of the $20 hats to increase his odds. \nThursday, Lambert shared the text of the letter he received from the company. It reads: \n\"Congrats! Per Elon's tweet, you've been randomly selected as one of 10 lucky hat aficionados invited to tour The Boring Company's LA tunnel, drive our boring machine, and attend our Hyperloop Competition weekend this summer! \n\"Expect to receive more information in late February as to the specific dates. Note that, if you choose to attend, you will need to cover your own transportation and accommodation costs. \n\"Bring some shoes you're comfortable getting dirty… and your hat, of course.\" \nMusk regularly tweeted updates about the sale of the $20 ball caps emblazoned with The Boring Company logo. The hats went on sale in October and were sold out by December, raising $1 million to fund the business.
