This would appear to have been one of the factors behind the shekel’s appreciation,” the Bank of Israel told Reuters in an emailed statement. \nThe shekel rose to a 3-1/2 year high against the dollar in 2017, while it gained 5 percent versus a basket of currencies of Israel’s main trading partners. In 2018, the shekel is up nearly 2 percent against the dollar to 3.41. \nBecause the central bank thinks the gains are not necessarily down to economic issues, such as the current account surplus, it has been buying foreign currency to prevent a more rapid appreciation, given that a strong shekel is harming exports. \n“Notwithstanding the improvement in the state of the economy, which is a basic factor in the strengthening of the shekel, the shekel remains over-valued,” the Bank of Israel said. \nIt said it “will continue to intervene in the market, as it has done recently, as long as there are exchange rate fluctuations that are not in line with economic fundamentals”. \nWhile in the past domestic banks dominated currency trading, offshore players have now boosted activity by about 40 percent, the bank said. \nBank of Israel Governor, Karnit Flug, referred to speculators in a speech earlier this month. \n“We have identified players that are not necessarily connected to real trading activity ... and we have also intervened in this regard,” she said, adding that lingering expansionary monetary policies taken by some countries are also propping up the shekel.
