Should the yuan continue to rise? Obviously, it requires the central bank to release some signal to stabilise (the Chinese currency),” the newspaper said, reinforcing that the 6.5 per dollar level remained “a key threshold”.\nThe newspaper also said a continued rise in the yuan would hurt exports and stimulate speculation in the foreign exchange market.\nMultiple traders said they did not expect any policy to be taken out to stabilise the yuan any time soon as the market was already very stable.\nThe Thomson Reuters/HKEX Global CNH index .RXYH, which tracks the offshore yuan against a basket of currencies on a daily basis, stood at 95.76, weaker than the previous day’s 95.93.\nThe global dollar index .DXY rose to 91.917 from the previous close of 91.872.\nThe offshore yuan was trading 0.01 percent firmer than the onshore spot at 6.505 per dollar.\nOffshore one-year non-deliverable forwards contracts (NDFs)CNY1YNDFOR=, considered the best available proxy for forward-looking market expectations of the yuan’s value, traded at 6.6395, 2.22 percent weaker than the midpoint.\nOne-year NDFs are settled against the midpoint, not the spot rate.\nReporting by Winni Zhou and John Ruwitch; editing by Simon Cameron-Moore\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-01-03T09:54:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-03T06:23:55.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
