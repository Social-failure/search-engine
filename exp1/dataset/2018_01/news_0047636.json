That pace easily beat the government’s 2017 target of around 6.5 percent, welcome news for policymakers looking to curb financial risks and cut corporate debt.\n“My personal opinion is that economic growth this year is very likely to exceed 6.5 percent, roughly between 6.5 and 6.8 percent,” Fan said.\nAnalysts polled by Reuters earlier this month also predicted a slowdown to 6.5 percent this year as government-led crackdowns on debt risks and factory pollution drag on overall activity.\nChina will focus on fending off risks this year, particularly risks that will impact regions and cause systemic fluctuations, Fan said.\n“To this end, we must remain highly vigilant and enhance our sense of urgency,” Fan said.\nEarlier this month, China’s banking regulator chief told the official People’s Daily in an interview that a black swan event could threaten the country’s financial stability, adding that risks, while still manageable, are “complex and serious.” (Reporting by Stella Qiu and Ryan Woo; Editing by Kim Coghill)\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-01-29T11:51:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-29T21:58:51.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
