A report by the regulator into the matter has never been published in full.\nCable said the full report concluded that RBS management “knew, or should have known”, that GRG’s mistreatment of customers was an “intended, co-ordinated strategy”.\n“The head of GRG responsible for that policy, Mr Nathan Bostock, is now chief executive of Santander,” Cable said, dragging Bostock into a scandal that has weighed on RBS’s reputation for years.\nA group of 500 small businesses affected by GRG called on the FCA and Bostock to clarify his involvement with the problems at the unit, its spokesman said in a statement.\nSantander UK declined to comment.\nThe debate follows the publication on Wednesday of a 2008 internal RBS memo written by a junior manager at the bank, which showed staff within GRG were given a list of ways to squeeze more money from the unit’s troubled clients.\nRBS has set aside 400 million pounds ($555 million) to cover the bill for claims against it over the actions of GRG, and it has acknowledged some bad practice at the unit.\n“We recognise how traumatic this period was for many customers and have acknowledged for some time that mistakes were made,” an RBS spokeswoman said.\n“The regulator has confirmed that the steps we have taken to address concerns were appropriate,” she said.\nThursday’s parliamentary debate topped off a difficult week for RBS, which also drew criticism for demanding tougher terms on its lending to British construction outsourcing company Carillion ( CLLN.L ) in the run up to the firm’s collapse.\nThe bank was one of a number of major British lenders to announce measures on Thursday to support small firms hit by the company’s demise.\nReporting by Emma Rumney; Editing by Hugh Lawson\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-01-19T05:43:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-19T00:43:51.009+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
