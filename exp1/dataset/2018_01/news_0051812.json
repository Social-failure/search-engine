Some House Republicans appear set to criticize Rosenstein in a contentious memo that they argue undermines Mueller's probe into Russian efforts to influence the 2016 election and whether the Trump campaign coordinated with the Kremlin.\nRosenstein oversees the investigation because Attorney General Jeff Sessions recused himself from it. Rosenstein appointed Mueller as special counsel to handle the probe last year.\nCheriss May | NurPhoto | Getty Images Rep. Paul Ryan, speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives Some observers see removing Rosenstein as a path for Trump to end Mueller's investigation. Trump has repeatedly said he did not collude with Russia and has sought a quick conclusion of the probe.\nThe president has said he thinks Mueller will be \"fair.\"\nIn a meeting with the House Republican conference Tuesday, Ryan cautioned members not to overstate the memo's significance, according to Politico . He also urged them to differentiate the memo from the Mueller investigation, the report said.\nRyan told reporters Tuesday that \"there may have been malfeasance at the FBI by certain individuals.\"\nRepublicans on the House Intelligence Committee voted Monday to make the surveillance memo public.\nThe questions about Rosenstein's future follow the abrupt departure of FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe on Monday . McCabe, who planned to retire in March, faced harsh public criticism from Trump.\nHe told friends he felt pressure to leave from FBI Director Christopher Wray, according to The New York Times .", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-30T18:17:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-30T18:17:58.013+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
