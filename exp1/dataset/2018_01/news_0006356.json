I know when I go and I lay it down and I absolutely left one jump on the table (turning a triple salchow into a single) but for me to put out two programs that I did at this competition, as solid as I skated and to get those scores, I am furious, and I think deservedly so.” \nThe 2018 Winter Games will take place Feb. 9-25 in Pyeongchang, South Korea. \nU.S. Figure Skating will announce its men‘s, pairs and ice dance athletes on Sunday after the men’s and pairs competition the previous day.
