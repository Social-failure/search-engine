We will not leave him alone in his fight against enemies”.\n“Demonstrators demand the punishment of those behind foreign-linked riots which insulted religion and our authorities,” state television reported, referring to the anti-government protests in which social media footage showed protesters tearing down pictures of Khamenei.\nKhatami also called on the government to “pay more attention to people’s economic problems.”\nUNITED FRONT To allay tension, the government has suspended its plans to cut cash handouts and increase fuel prices.\n“There are workers who say they have not received their salaries for months ... These problems should be resolved,” Khatami said, according to state TV.\nFearing that further unrest could undermine the Islamic republic altogether, Iran’s faction-ridden political elite has displayed a united front.\nBut Khamenei and his hardline allies have criticised Rouhani for failing to revive the economy after most sanctions on Iran were lifted in 2016 under a nuclear deal reached between Tehran and major powers aimed at curbing the country’s nuclear programme.\nRouhani secured the deal in 2015, raising hopes of better economic times among many Iranians, but discontent has since risen over the lack of broad improvement in living standards.\nWriting by Parisa Hafezi, Editing by William Maclean\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-01-05T20:38:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-05T22:39:10.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
