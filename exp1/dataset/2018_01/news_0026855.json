(NYSE:FGP) (“Ferrellgas” or the “Company”) announced the sale of Bridger Energy, LLC, a subsidiary of Bridger Logistics, which is a subsidiary of Ferrellgas, L.P. The sale was to an undisclosed buyer and terms of the transaction were not announced.\n“This transaction is a clear example of Ferrellgas’ commitment to debt reduction,” said James E. Ferrell, Interim Chief Executive Officer and President. “The sale significantly reduces our interest expense, improves our credit metrics, and lessens the Company’s reliance on its credit facility as we move forward with growth efforts. In addition, today’s announcement lowers the risk profile of our business while only minimally impacting EBITDA.”\nWith the sale, the Company will exit Bridger Energy’s oil purchase and sale activity, and as a result will be able to realize a near-term reduction in letters of credit issued to support Bridger Energy from its current credit facility of approximately $80 million. On an annualized basis, the interest expense savings associated with the reduction in issued letters of credit and surety bonding of the business will be approximately $4.5 million.\nSaid Ferrell, “As we work toward the renewal of our working capital facilities, this sale reduces the amount of credit support we will need from those renewed facilities with a more than adequate level of liquidity available to us to run our business. Strategically, we will continue to execute on objectives that raise cash and reduce expenses, particularly initiatives that are not weather dependent. We have excellent momentum, our employees remain focused on providing excellent service to our customers, and we continue to see solid progress towards our goals.”\nAbout Ferrellgas\nFerrellgas Partners, L.P., through its operating partnership, Ferrellgas, L.P., and subsidiaries, serves propane customers in all 50 states, the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico, and provides midstream services to major energy companies in the United States.
