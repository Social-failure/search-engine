It is the country’s principal gateway and handles about 99 percent of external trade, including key imports for the country’s population of 1.3 million such as food and oil.\nEtienne Sinatambou, the Minister for Environment and also head of the National Crisis Committee, told a news conference Wednesday afternoon about 2,000 people had been received in 43 storm shelters around the island.\nAn association of vegetable farmers told local media their fields had been flooded and that the prices of fresh produce would likely jump in coming days.\nImages posted on various social networks platforms showed several roads in the coastal regions of the island flooded.\nAbout 300 households were without electricity, according to the Central Electricity Board (CEB).\nMany residents fear Berguitta will cause extensive damage when it makes landfall, and the island of Reunion was also on alert as the cyclone approached.\nSoobiraj Sok Appadu, ex-director of the meteorological service, told a radio station he estimated the cyclone might shave between 1 to 2 percentage points from the country’s GDP.\nIn February 1994, Cyclone Hollanda killed two people, destroyed 450 homes and caused $135 million in damage when it hit Mauritius.\nReporting by Jean Paul Arouff; Writing by Clement Uwiringiyimana; editing by Elias Biryabarema and John Stonestreet\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-01-18T00:05:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-18T16:17:13.003+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
