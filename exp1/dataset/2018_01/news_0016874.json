The downhill will now be held on Sunday. \nMost skiers struggled in the conditions, including four-times overall World Cup winner Lindsey Vonn who finished ninth, however Brignone said she relished them. \n“When the race is tough, I‘m better,” she told Swiss broadcaster SRF after winning her second race of the season following her giant slalom win in Lienz in December.

Everyone else made mistakes and I didn‘t.” Slideshow (2 Images) \nGut was runner-up for the second time in a World Cup race following her comeback from the knee injury she suffered at the world championships in St Moritz last February, when she tore her anterior cruciate ligament. \nShe might have won but for a mistake at the end of the course when she hit a gate with her arm, costing her crucial tenths of a second. \nAmerican Mikaela Shiffrin, a slalom specialist who holds a huge lead in the overall World Cup race, did not take part. The 22-year-old heads the overall standings with 1381 points, an almost insurmountable 821 clear of Swiss Wendy Holdener.
