That 2014 deal was worth $3 billion, with approximately $400 million of that vesting over time .\nBut Iovine, who is in his 60s, has openly flouted the business behind music streaming companies , even in his role at Apple Music.\nFor more on the story, see the report from Billboard.\nWATCH: Iovine on Apple, Beats deal show chapters Iovine on Apple, Beats deal 8:00 AM ET Thu, 29 May 2014", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-05T01:05:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-05T01:05:48.042+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
