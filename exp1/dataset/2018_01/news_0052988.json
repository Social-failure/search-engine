The Windows maker said system instability triggered by Intel's faulty patch can in some cases cause \"data loss or corruption\".\nMicrosoft said its latest update prevented computers to reboot unexpectedly and urged affected customers to manually download it from the Microsoft Update Catalog website.\nMeltdown was specific to chips from Intel as well as one from SoftBank Group Corp's ARM Holdings. Spectre affected nearly every modern computing device, including ones with chips from Intel, ARM and Advanced Micro Devices.\nLast week, Intel said that patches it released to address the two high-profile security vulnerabilities in its chips are faulty, advising customers, computer makers and cloud providers\nto stop installing them.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-30T06:46:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-30T07:09:51.549+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
