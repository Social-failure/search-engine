It was a fantastic competition,” Pilz said.\nIt was also a chance for South Africans to compete without the expense of travel to Europe, including Sive Speelman, who is hoping to become the country’s first black Alpine Skier to go to the Olympics this year.\n“For both international and local skiers it is a great opportunity to get points before the European season even starts,” Pilz says.\n“Our skiers can gain so much by competing with these international racers and you can see the standard is getting better and better.”\nBut away from the professional snow sports scene, Pilz says skiing and snowboarding in particular have an important role to play in the tourism industry and as a boost to job creation in a country where the unemployment rate is rising and currently stands at 27.7 percent.\n“Can you imagine tourists from all over the world having the opportunity for high-quality skiing in Africa, then head for a safari at one of the national parks and after that surf in the sea in Cape Town or Durban,” Pilz says.\n“Snow sports can play a bigger role in the tourism economy and we are starting to do that. That is probably where the biggest benefit of having quality skiing in South Africa will be felt in the long-term. People think we don’t have snow here, but we do.”\nReporting By Nick Said; Editing by Christian Radnedge\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-01-23T23:31:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-23T17:40:50.017+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
