While chasing a loose ball along the sideline, he ran over Georgia coach Mark Fox, and both men tumbled backward over the scorers’ table. Neither man was injured.\nThe result of the game was an upset in terms of RPI. Entering the game, Georgia was at No. 41. South Carolina was No. 71.\nPerhaps Georgia’s travel problems from Tuesday to Thursday this week took a toll on the Bulldogs. The team attempted to get to and from a road game at Missouri and lost a practice day in the process.\nSouth Carolina led 37-29 at halftime, thanks in part to 10 points by Silva. Georgia’s Maten had 14 points.\nThe Gamecocks also had a 13-2 edge in offensive rebounds, which led to 11 points.\nGeorgia started the second half with a 10-2 run, tying the score 39-39 with 14:19 to go on a three-point play by Juwan Parker.\nBut the Bulldogs could never get the lead, and the Gamecocks won their third straight game in this series. Georgia still leads the all-time series 58-53.\n--Field Level Media\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-01-14T04:42:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-14T20:27:58.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
