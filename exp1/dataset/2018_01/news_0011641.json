Washington scored a 5-4 overtime victory vs. the Hurricanes on Jan. 2, and these teams will play again at Carolina Friday night at 7:30.\nThis loss stopped a five-game Washington winning streak. Also, the Capitals had won 10 straight at home, the longest win streak of that type in the NHL this season.\nWashington had not lost at home since the Los Angeles Kings handed the Capitals a 5-2 defeat on Nov. 30. The Capitals couldn’t create much on offense against the Hurricanes, who don’t allow many shots per game.\nCarolina finished with a 33-28 edge in shots.\nJordan Staal gave Carolina a 1-0 lead with a shorthanded breakaway goal.\nHe picked off a soft pass from Capitals defenseman John Carlson from near the left boards and turned it into a breakaway, beating Holtby with 8:27 remaining in the second period for an unassisted goal.\nLars Eller tied it for Washington later in that period, one-timing a perfect pass from T.J. Oshie past goalie Scott Darling with 3:55 left.\nDarling finished with 27 saves in the victory.\nIn off-the-ice news, the NHL announced on Thursday that Dallas businessman Tom Dundon will take over as Carolina majority owner. He closed the deal with Peter Karmanos Jr., who will keep a minority ownership interest with the Hurricanes. A press conference to announce the move is scheduled for Friday.\n--Field Level Media\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-01-12T11:09:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-12T18:29:22.001+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
