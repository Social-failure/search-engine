But even amidst the crash (the first since last December ), there are a few cryptocurrencies that are eking out gains today. \nAs of 9 a.m. ET, two digital currencies were showing notable gains on Tuesday. Neblio, a coin tied to a blockchain developer platform that aims to build decentralized applications and services, was up 12%, while Gas, which ties in with the Neo smart contracts ecosystem , saw gains of 9%. \nBoth cryptocurrencies were off their highs, though. \nTwo more, meanwhile, were managing to stay in positive territory, though just barely. Cryptonex was up 4%. And the mysterious Tether was up 1.3%. \nOn Monday, Bloomberg reported that China—which already banned cryptocurrency exchanges last year—is stepping up actions against other online and app-based services that offer exchange-like functionality. \nMonday also saw reports emerge that BlackWallet , a provider of digital wallet services, suffered a clever attack that allowed someone to make off with hundreds of thousands of “lumens”—the virtual coin used by a system called Steller—that had a total value of more than $400,000. \nOf course, given the selloff and the overall volatility of the sector, there’s no guarantee that any of these cryptocurrencies will remain in positive territory for any length of time.
