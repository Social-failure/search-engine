Internally, management includes the cash flow impact from these contracts when evaluating the Company's operating performance, when planning, forecasting and analyzing future periods, and when assessing the performance of its management team.\nDebt Repricing\nOn January 23, 2018, the Company completed a successful repricing of its Term B Loans, reducing its borrowing rate by 75 basis points, to a new rate of Libor plus 250 basis points. In connection with the repricing, the Company paid down $100 million of its outstanding debt.\nTax Impact\nThe Q4 2017 preliminary GAAP EPS number does not reflect the impact of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “2017 Tax Act”), which is still being evaluated by the Company. The 2017 Tax Act reduces the U.S. corporate tax rate to 21% and reduces the rate on Foreign-Derived Intangible Income to an even lower effective tax rate of 13.1%. At present, the Company expects to record an estimated non-cash charge between $4 million and $8 million in Q4 of 2017 to revalue its Deferred Tax Assets and Deferred Tax Liabilities as a result of the lower tax rate. The Company does not expect to record a charge for the mandatory one-time deemed repatriation of foreign earnings under the 2017 Tax Act. In the next few years, the Company expects to continue paying cash taxes primarily for foreign withholding tax rather than U.S. corporate income tax. Longer term, the Company should benefit from the lower corporate tax rate set by the 2017 Tax Act.\nEarnings Conference Call\nThe Company will hold its fourth quarter 2017, earnings conference call at 2:00 PM Pacific time (5:00 PM Eastern time) on Tuesday, February 13, 2018. To access the call in the U.S., please dial +1 800-239-9838, and for international callers dial +1 323-794-2551, approximately 15 minutes prior to the start of the conference call.

The non-GAAP financial measures also exclude the effects of FASB Accounting Standards Codification 718, “Stock Compensation” upon the number of diluted shares used in calculating non-GAAP earnings per share. Management believes that the non-GAAP measures used in this release provide investors with important perspectives into the Company’s ongoing business performance. The non-GAAP financial measures disclosed by the Company should not be considered a substitute for, or superior to, financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP, and the financial results calculated in accordance with GAAP and reconciliations to those financial statements should be carefully evaluated. The non-GAAP financial measures used by the Company may be calculated differently from, and therefore may not be comparable to, similarly titled measures used by other companies. All financial data is presented on a GAAP basis except where the Company indicates its presentation is on a non-GAAP basis.\nSet forth below are reconciliations of Company’s GAAP earnings per share to non-GAAP earnings per share preliminary results for the fourth quarter of 2017.\nSOURCE: XPERI CORP\nXPER-E\nRECONCILIATION FROM GAAP NET INCOME PER SHARE TO NON-GAAP NET INCOME PER SHARE (unaudited) Three Months Ended December 31, 2017 Net income per share - GAAP $ 0.24 Adjustments to GAAP net income per share: Stock-based compensation expense 0.19 Amortization of acquired intangibles 0.55 Acquisition related costs 0.09 Tax adjustments for non-GAAP items and other (0.32) Net income per share - non-GAAP $ 0.75\nView source version on businesswire.com : http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180124005414/en/\nXperi Corporation\nGeri Weinfeld, +1 818-436-1231\nSenior Director, Investor Relations\ngeri.weinfeld@xperi.com\nor\nJordan Miller, +1 818-436-1082\nSenior Director, Consumer Marketing and Communications\njordan.miller@xperi.com\nSource: Xperi Corporation", "external_links": ["http://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.xperi.com&esheet=51747964&newsitemid=20180124005414&lan=en-US&anchor=www.xperi.com&index=2&md5=0c856abe1a5e2e9d0428ae7cffc05121", "http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180124005414/en/", "http://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.xperi.com&esheet=51747964&newsitemid=20180124005414&lan=en-US&anchor=www.xperi.com&index=1&md5=0020d51f9b81d8eec06df37d0a4b2c7e", "http://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.sec.gov&esheet=51747964&newsitemid=20180124005414&lan=en-US&anchor=www.sec.gov&index=3&md5=3909244962e2c4ccd55b167f4bc8dabd", "http://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.xperi.com&esheet=51747964&newsitemid=20180124005414&lan=en-US&anchor=www.xperi.com&index=4&md5=67ebf1418f3719740bb14a9a70196423"], "published": "2018-01-24T17:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-24T16:56:03.003+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
