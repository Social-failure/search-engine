Pfizer said it expects the 17 percent rate to be sustainable. \nPfizer Chief Executive Ian Read had long lobbied for cutting U.S. corporate taxes and twice had large deals thwarted that would have placed Pfizer under European tax rules. NO DEAL PRESSURE \nBecause of the new, low tax rate, Read said he was now under no pressure to do immediate deals, but remained open to acquisitions large and small under the right circumstances. \nPfizer is expected to entertain bids for its consumer health business, which could be worth $20 billion, although it said it may still decide to keep it.. \nHow that turns out could influence other business development decisions, Read said in a telephone interview. “However, it wouldn’t stop us from moving quickly if we saw an opportunity.” \nIf pricing pressure on medicines continues to mount, Pfizer could do major deals, Read said, but added that there is “a sense of urgency” to accelerate earnings per share growth. \nThe company forecast 2018 profit well ahead of Wall Street estimates and increased its dividend to 34 cents a share. Combined with share buybacks, that will return more than $13 billion to shareholders, Chief Financial Officer Frank D‘Amelio said.

REUTERS/Andrew Kelly/File photo REPATRIATION \nPfizer recorded a $10.7 billion gain from the tax overhaul and said it was reviewing capital allocation plans under the new code. \nIt plans to invest about $5 billion in the United States over the next five years and pay about $15 billion in taxes over eight years to bring funds kept overseas back to the United States under the new tax laws. \nPfizer said it plans to repatriate about $20 billion, based on third-quarter cash and investment levels. \nFor 2018, Pfizer forecast adjusted earnings of $2.90 to $3 per share and revenue of $53.5 billion to $55.5 billion, figures that include a full-year contribution from consumer healthcare. \nAnalysts were estimating earnings of $2.78 per share and revenue of $53.9 billion. \nPfizer’s fourth-quarter adjusted profit of 62 cents per share topped analysts’ average expectations by 6 cents, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. \nQuarterly results were fueled by strong demand for its Prevnar pneumonia vaccine and rheumatoid arthritis drug Xeljanz. PIPELINE CONFIDENCE \nThe company expressed confidence that its pipeline of drugs in development for cancer, pain and other conditions, as well as a large opportunity if Xtandi gains expanded approval for earlier prostate cancer use, can more than offset generic competition for blockbuster products Viagra and Lyrica. \nIt projected about a $2 billion annual impact from losses of patent exclusivities from 2018 to 2020, decreasing to about $500 million or less through 2025. \nPfizer said it has about 20 cancer drug combinations being tested and has not given up on becoming a player in the most lucrative lung cancer market despite lagging rivals. \nPfizer shares fell $1.37 to $37.65.
