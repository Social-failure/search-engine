Asked if he would return to frontline politics, he said: “Doubt it.” \nFarage declined to comment on the confusion inside UKIP, whose leader Henry Bolton has refused to resign after his lover, Jo Marney, made offensive comments about Markle and black people in text messages to a friend. \nMarney, who began dating Bolton just after Christmas, described Markle, a U.S. actress whose father is white and mother African-American, as a “dumb little commoner” and said “her seed with (sic) taint our royal family”, according to the texts printed in a Sunday newspaper. \nMarney also described black people as ugly. She later apologised for the text messages and Bolton said they were ending their relationship.

Slideshow (3 Images) \nBolton lost a vote of confidence from the party’s national executive committee on Sunday but told reporters in Folkestone, southern England, on Monday that “I shall not be resigning as party leader”. Bolton promised to “drain the swamp” of UKIP and remove those responsible for infighting. \n“During the next four weeks I shall be calling for the coordination and mobilisation of all Leave campaigns, to ensure that the government delivers full independence from the European Union,” he said. \nBolton has said Marney’s texts were abhorrent, unwise and offensive. \nUKIP’s deputy leader, Margot Parker, resigned in protest at Bolton’s refusal to go, the BBC reported. \nUnder Farage, UKIP had won nearly 4 million votes - a share of 12.6 percent - in the 2015 election on its anti-EU platform, projecting it to the forefront of British politics even though it only managed to win one seat in parliament. \nIts popularity prompted then-prime minister David Cameron, who once dismissed the party as being full of “fruitcakes, loonies and closet racists”, to hold the Brexit referendum.
