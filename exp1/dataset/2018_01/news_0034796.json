One in five had experienced sexual assault.\nIt highlighted evidence of a blame culture with 38 percent of men saying a woman was totally or partially to blame if she was assaulted after going out at night in a short skirt and getting drunk. A third of women agreed.\nThe report also called for a review on the admissibility of evidence on a victim’s sexual history in rape trials.\n“What we see is a deeply misogynistic culture where harassment and abuse are endemic and normalized coupled with a legal system that lets women down because in many cases it doesn’t provide access to justice,” Fawcett Society chief executive Sam Smethers said in a statement.\nThe report also said progress on closing the pay gap had stalled and a lack of transparency prevented women from challenging unequal pay.\nThe issue was highlighted this month when the BBC’s China correspondent Carrie Gracie quit after revealing that she was earning far less than senior male colleagues.\nThe experts also recommended extending protection from pregnancy discrimination to six months after maternity leave ends, saying many pregnant women and working mothers were being pressured into leaving their jobs.\nLawmaker Maria Miller, who chairs parliament’s Women and Equalities Committee, said the report showed there was still “significant work to be done” on pay, family-friendly working rights and sexual harassment.\nShe called for “a revolution in the workplace” to ensure fairness for women, men and their families.\nThe committee recently launched an inquiry into sexual harassment in public places.\nEditing by Katy Migiro.
