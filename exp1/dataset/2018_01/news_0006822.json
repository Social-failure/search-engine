We will call anew the passage of the Occupational Safety and Health Standards (bill).” \nThe lower house of Congress will resume its session on Jan. 15. \nThe left-wing bloc will seek to ensure the accountability of the Philippine Economic Zone Authority, the Labour Department, the Davao City government and companies involved, Brosas said. \nA security officer of the New City Commercial Center shopping mall was among the 38 killed in the fire, which injured six people, although about 100 call centre employees survived. \nSSI has declined to comment on the issue of fire safety at its Davao offices until the investigation is completed. \nThe Research Now SSI offices in Davao employ 500 people. It promised to relocate some to a bigger facility in the central Philippines while looking for a new site in the south. \nOn its website, SSI says it has more than 11 million panelists in 40 countries with more than 300 clients worldwide, including Twitter, Facebook, Nielsen, Capital One, BestBuy and Liberty Mutual.
