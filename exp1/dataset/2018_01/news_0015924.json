The percentage that would vote to leave next time would be very much bigger than it was last time round and we may just finish the whole thing off.\"\nBritain voted 52 percent to 48 percent to leave the EU in the June 2016 referendum.\nFarage served as the leader of UKIP in the run up to the Brexit referendum in June 2016, but resigned a month later, claiming his political ambition had been \"achieved\".\nUKIP has long called for Britain to leave the EU, particularly over its stance on immigration. The party has declined in popularity significantly following the Brexit referendum, gaining no seats and just 1.8 percent of the vote in 2017's snap election , down from 12.6 percent in 2015.\nFarage's comments come as analysis commissioned by Mayor of London Sadiq Khan showed the U.K. economy could lose 500,000 jobs and $67 billion by 2030 because of Brexit.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/5WrightStuff/status/951394851811221510"], "published": "2018-01-11T14:54:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-11T14:51:03.007+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
