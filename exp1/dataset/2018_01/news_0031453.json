Lavrov denied any interference. \nIn an earlier video, AMLO, as he is also known, responded to a dig from President Enrique Pena Nieto by suggesting the Mexican leader should take an “Amlodipine” pill, a medication for high blood pressure. \nLopez Obrador, who maintains a strong lead in opinion polls, has also softened his image with videos of him at home with his wife and children, and engaged in everyday activities such as getting his haircut. \nLopez Obrador’s detractors have long compared him to former Venezuelan leader Hugo Chavez, suggesting he would seek to usher in a socialist revolution in Mexico, Latin America’s No. 2 economy. \nLopez Obrador says his movement draws its influence only from Mexican historical leaders.
