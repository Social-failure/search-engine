Sebastian Coe, IAAF's President, attends a press conference as part of the International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF) council meeting in Monaco, November 26, 2017. REUTERS/Jean-Pierre Amet \nThe source said the IOC had discussed the matter of Infantino and Coe and a final decision had yet to be taken but they were “unlikely” to be proposed for membership. \nInfantino was elected head of FIFA in 2016 to succeed scandal-plagued Sepp Blatter and lead the federation out of its biggest graft crisis. \nFormer double Olympic champion Coe took over the IAAF in 2015 as a doping scandal unfolded, severely damaging the organisation’s credibility. \nCoe triggered the ire of the IOC when the IAAF blocked Russian track and field athletes from competing at the Rio de Janeiro Olympics last year over the doping affair. \nCoe’s predecessor Lamine Diack faces a bribery and embezzlement investigation in France. \nBoth Blatter and Diack were IOC members until 2015. Blatter’s predecessor at FIFA, Joao Havelange, was an IOC member from 1963 to 2011. Diack’s predecessor, Primo Nebiolo, was also an IOC member.
