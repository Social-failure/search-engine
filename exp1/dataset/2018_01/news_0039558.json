The deal resolved a three-day shutdown in Washington.\nKeeping some of the enthusiasm in check, U.S. President Donald Trump late Monday slapped steep import tariffs on washing machines and solar panels. That put a cloud over global trade.\nIn U.S. stocks, Netflix was up 10.6 percent and hit a record high after the video-streaming pioneer beat Wall Street targets for new subscribers in the fourth quarter. The majority of results so far this earnings season have been stronger than expected.\n“Generally, we like the trend of earnings, we think they will continue to be good and our forecasts for the rest of the year look good,” said Mike Baele, managing director at U.S. Bank Private Client Wealth Management in Portland, Oregon.\n“It is not surprising the market is taking comfort in these good numbers.”\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 5.14 points, or 0.02 percent, to 26,209.46, the S&P 500 gained 5.9 points, or 0.21 percent, to 2,838.87 and the Nasdaq Composite added 48.51 points, or 0.65 percent, to 7,456.54.\nThe pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index rose 0.12 percent and MSCI’s gauge of stocks across the globe gained 0.47 percent.\nData showed euro zone consumer confidence jumped much more than expected in January, underlining the strong momentum in the euro zone economy.\nThat pushed the dollar index to a three-year low.\nThe dollar index fell 0.29 percent, with the euro up 0.24 percent to $1.229.\nSome investors speculate that the recent bearish move in the dollar may be coming to a close amid brewing concerns over the U.S. stance on global trade.\nAlso in the foreign exchange market, Britain’s pound topped $1.40 for the first time since voters there chose in 2016 to leave the European Union.\nSterling was last trading at $1.3995, up 0.07 percent on the day.\nBrent crude inched above $70 a barrel for the first time in a week before settling just below that level. Healthy world economic growth prospects boosted oil.\nBrent crude futures gained 93 cents to settle at $69.96, and rose above $70 during the session. U.S. crude futures rose 90 cents to settle at $64.47.\nU.S. Treasury debt yields slid, in line with declines in Japanese government bond yields, after the Bank of Japan kept interest rate targets unchanged and its top official quashed speculation of a move away from an easy monetary policy.\nBenchmark 10-year notes last rose 11/32 in price to yield 2.6242 percent, from 2.663 percent late on Monday.\nAdditional reporting by Marc Jones and Saikat Chatterjee in London, Chuck Mikolajczak, Saqib Iqbal Ahmed, David Gaffen and Gertrude Chavez-Dreyfuss in New York; Editing by Bernadette Baum and Nick Zieminski\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-01-24T04:37:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-24T15:46:29.008+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
