Its network expansion this year includes adding flights to Indian cities Ahmedabad, Kochi, and Mumbai.\nThe airline intends to cut its cost per passenger to 55 euros by the end of 2019, down from 90 euros per passenger today, and 100 euros per passenger in 2016.\nRamachandran said Jazeera Airways was increasingly focusing on improving ancillary revenue, including through food and beverage and baggage charges.\nJazeera Airways will release its 2017 financial results in the coming weeks, Ramachandran said.
