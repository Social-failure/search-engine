A MobileIron spokesperson told CNBC that the store will likely launch in the second half of 2018, and will initially target phone companies like AT&T and Deutsche Telecom, which sell cloud services to their customers. \nThe partnership builds on Google's acquisition of Orbitera , a platform for cloud marketplaces, in late 2016. \nThe new store could make Google's cloud offerings more competitive with Amazon Web Services, which introduced a cloud software store in 2012. Google's cloud business, run by CEO Diane Greene, is currently a distant third behind Amazon and Microsoft Azure. \nMobileIron, which has a market value of below $500 million, is flat over the past year, while shares of Google parent Alphabet have jumped 44 percent.
