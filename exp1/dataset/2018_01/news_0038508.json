REUTERS/Mike Segar/Files \nFinancial markets have brushed off the shutdown. \nStill, the shutdown stopped federal discretionary spending that represents about 38 percent of non-debt related outlays and includes most day-to-day government operations, according to Moody‘s. \nIt is unclear when the shutdown will end as Republican and Democratic lawmakers have been unable to reach a funding agreement, even a temporary one. \nEven with the current impasse on government funding, Moody’s expected Congress will raise the debt ceiling before the government is expected to run out of cash in late February or early March after extraordinary measures by the Treasury Department are exhausted.
