Rutta beat Hellebuyck with a sharp-angled wrist shot from the bottom of the right circle for his fifth tally of the season.\nAnthony Duclair, who was acquired on Wednesday from the Arizona Coyotes and skated on a line with Kampf and Rutta, collected an assist in his Blackhawks debut.\nPatrick Laine replied for the Jets late in the third period, his 20th goal of the season, but the visitors couldn’t find the equalizer.\nPrior to Laine’s goal, the closest Winnipeg came to scoring was when the hosts came within inches of an own goal, but Chicago’s Gustav Forsling chased down the puck from the offensive zone just before the a teammate’s errant pass went into his own net on a delayed Winnipeg penalty.\nHellebuyck stopped 25 shots for the Jets, who went into the game riding a three-game winning streak and unbeaten in regulation in seven outings.\nChicago will play host to the Detroit Red Wings on Sunday before enjoying its bye week, while the Jets will face the Minnesota Wild on Saturday before having a break.\n--Field Level Media\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-01-13T12:40:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-13T14:34:29.045+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
