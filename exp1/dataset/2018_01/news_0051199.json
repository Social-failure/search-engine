Foti, Jr., Esq., a partner at the law firm of Kahn Swick & Foti, LLC (\"KSF\"), announces that KSF has commenced an investigation into MetLife Inc. (NYSE: MET).\nOn January 29, 2018, the Company disclosed \"a material weakness in internal controls over financial reporting\" that caused reserves to be reduced incorrectly in relation to outstanding payouts for annuity and pension recipients. As a result, the Company had postponed the release of its Q4 earnings report and expected to increase reserves by $525 million and $575 million, decreasing its Q4 earnings by $135 million to $165 million and 2017 profits by $165 million to $195 million. MetLife also revealed an ongoing SEC investigation into the issues surrounding the outstanding pension payments.\nOn this news, the price of MetLife's shares plummeted.\nKSF's investigation is focusing on whether MetLife and/or its officers and directors violated state or federal securities laws.\nIf you are a MetLife shareholder and have suffered losses, you may, without obligation or cost to you, contact KSF Managing Partner Lewis Kahn toll-free at 1-877-515-1850 or via email ( lewis.kahn@ksfcounsel.com ), or visit http://ksfcounsel.com/cases/nyse-met/ to learn more.\nAbout Kahn Swick & Foti, LLC\nKSF, whose partners include the former Louisiana Attorney General Charles C.
