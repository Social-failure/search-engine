Representative Elise Stefanik, a Republican, also signed the letter.\nTrump signed the defense bill in December. He has vowed to withdraw the United States from the Paris climate accord but said this week that the administration \"could conceivably go back in\" to the agreement.\nU.S. military leaders have long been concerned about climate change. In written testimony to the Senate Armed Services Committee after his confirmation hearing last year, Secretary of Defense Jim Mattis wrote that \"climate change can be a driver of instability\" and \"a challenge that requires a broader, whole-of-government response.\" The testimony was first published by ProPublica.\nRetired top U.S. military officers and former national security officials have said storms, droughts and floods made more intense by climate change can be a burden on the Pentagon by fueling unrest in unstable countries and boosting the need for humanitarian missions.\nThe U.S. military also faces risks from climate a few hours' drive from the White House. The main road to the U.S. Naval Station in Norfolk, Virginia, the world's largest naval base, experiences chronic flooding, and electric and water utilities supporting it are threatened during frequent flooding.\nOther Republicans signing the letter included Representatives Carlos Curbelo, Ryan Costello and Brian Fitzpatrick.\nThe White House did not immediately return a request for comment on the letter.\n(Reporting by Timothy Gardner; Editing by Matthew Lewis)", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-12T20:37:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-13T09:46:38.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
