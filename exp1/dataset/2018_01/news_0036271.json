BRT pushed for tax reform that will allow U.S. businesses to compete and win, benefiting American workers,” said Jessica Boulanger, a senior vice president with the Business Roundtable in a statement.\nThe Business Roundtable is led by Jamie Dimon, chairman and CEO of JPMorgan Chase & Co. Other members include the CEOs of Northrop Grumman Corp, Johnson & Johnson and General Motors Co.\nThe Chamber of Commerce did not respond to a request for comment.\nLobbyists played an outsized role in shaping the tax overhaul.\nRepublican Congressman Kevin Brady, chairman of the tax-writing U.S. House Ways and Means Committee, told Reuters last year that an aggressive corporate lobbying effort derailed a Republican-backed border tax, forcing lawmakers working on tax reform to seek alternatives.\nReporting by Chris Sanders; Editing by Richard Pullin and Jeffrey Benkoe\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-23T05:03:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-23T05:21:35.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
