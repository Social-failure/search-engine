He was banking on cooperation from other parties on the vast majority of issues, he said. \n“Ninety-five percent of decisions will be made without difficult discussions and probably with consensus - we won’t always vote against things,” Boehringer said, adding that the committee had traditionally been relatively cooperative. \nBut the remaining 5 percent of decisions would be controversial, he said, pointing to the AfD’s opposition to taking in migrants granted “subsidiary protection” rather than full refugee status, euro zone rescues and spending by the European Stability Mechanism (ESM) bailout fund. \n“I’ll definitely critically scrutinise that spending because we reject euro zone rescues in principle,” he said but added: “There’s no doubt we’ll be outvoted.” \nWhile Boehringer said he would focus on topics relevant to the AfD, he recognised he had a duty to moderate all topics. \n“It’s not very political - it’s more of a moderating job and that’s why this post is rather overestimated - it’s not as powerful as everyone always makes out,” he said. \nBoehringer said the committee the AfD’s scope for blocking anything would be limited, given that the parties that have a governing majority also have a majority in the committee. \n“We don’t have a majority, not even in the committee, and even having the chair doesn’t help,” he said. \nBoehringer has worked as a corporate consultant and wants all of Germany’s gold repatriated from vaults abroad such as in New York and Paris, arguing that it is too risky to keep the “ultimate reserve” of the central bank outside Germany. But he said this was not a matter for the budget committee. \nThere have been concerns that the AfD will gain credibility by taking positions like the budget committee chair, but the other parties are keen to maintain the informal rules to prevent it from taking on the role of victim by changing those rules [nL8N1PB57B].
