The economy grew 2.0 percent in 2016.\nThe government has previously said it expects growth of 1.5 to 3.5 percent in 2018.\nThe city-state’s growth figures come amid signs Asian economies remained on a solid footing in late 2017.\nJapanese exports accelerated sharply in November, while exports in South Korea climbed for the 14th straight month in December. In China, the manufacturing sector slowed slightly but still expanded in December for the 18th straight month.\nSingapore’s trade-reliant economy had enjoyed a boost in 2017 from an improvement in global demand, particularly for electronics products and components such as semiconductors.\nThe manufacturing sector lost some shine in the fourth quarter, however, contracting 11.5 percent on an annualized basis after jumping 38.0 percent in the third quarter. Compared with a year earlier, manufacturing grew 6.2 percent in the fourth quarter.\nThe construction sector contracted 3.6 percent on an annualized basis, shrinking for the fourth straight quarter.\nThe services sector grew 7.5 percent on an annualized basis, recording the fastest growth since the fourth quarter of 2016.\nReporting by Masayuki Kitano; Editing by Sam Holmes\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-01-02T08:18:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-02T05:16:34.008+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
