Analysts on average had expected $1.23 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.\nThe net loss was $148.1 million, or 40 cents per share, reflecting a $289.5 million one-time charge related to new U.S. tax laws.\nExcluding one-time items, it earned 53 cents per share, edging past analysts' average estimate by 1 cent.\nThe company announced an 80 percent increase to its quarterly dividend and a $2 billion share buyback plan.\nJuniper plans to repatriate about $3 billion as a result of the recent U.S. tax reform.
