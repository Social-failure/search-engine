Yup, that probability has gone up,” Carney said when asked about the chance of sharp falls in asset prices during a World Economic Forum panel discussion. \n“The question is whether the core of the financial system is in a position where it’s going to amplify those movements in an adverse way and there will be a feedback to the real economy,” Carney said. “And on that component of the probability, I would put that as quite low.” \nReforms to the banking system since the global financial crisis meant there had been “a huge shift” in the preparedness of financial companies to cope with future shocks, he said.
