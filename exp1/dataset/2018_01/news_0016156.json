They described Trump’s announcement as a “dangerous violation of international law” which had no legal impact.\nIn recognizing Jerusalem as the Israeli capital, Trump reversed decades of U.S. policy, imperiling Middle East peace efforts and upsetting the Arab world and Western allies alike.\nThe status of Jerusalem - home to sites holy to the Muslim, Jewish and Christian religions - is one of the biggest obstacles to reaching a peace agreement between Israel and the Palestinians.\nReporting by Ali Abdelaty, writing by Amina Ismail; Editing by Gareth Jones\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-10T15:16:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-10T15:21:39.007+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
