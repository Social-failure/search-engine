The company’s video business has been pressured by consumers canceling cable packages in favor of cheaper streaming options from companies like Netflix Inc ( NFLX.O ).\nAnd while it added broadband subscribers, analysts have questioned how much that business can continue to grow. Comcast added 350,000 high-speed internet customers in the quarter, compared with a gain of 385,000 the same period a year earlier.\nComcast Chief Executive Brian Roberts also said on the company’s post-earnings conference call that the company ended 2017 with more than 380,000 customer lines for its mobile service, launched in May.\nAsked about the company’s interest in acquisitions, Roberts said, “We are always looking for ways to create more value for shareholders,” adding that “there’s nothing we feel that we have to acquire.”\nRevenue grew 4.2 percent to $21.92 billion from a year earlier, roughly in line with analyst expectations of $21.82 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.\nNet income attributable to Comcast rose to $15.0 billion, or $3.17 per share, for the quarter, from $2.3 billion, or 48 cents a share. The company was able to book a gain on its deferred tax bill thanks to recently lowered U.S. corporate tax rates.\nRevenue rose 3.4 percent in the cable business, which includes video, internet and voice services.\nNBCUniversal’s revenue rose 3.9 percent in the quarter, helped by the segment’s theme park business.\nReporting by Anjali Athavaley; Editing by Meredith Mazzilli\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-24T14:06:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-24T14:24:27.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
