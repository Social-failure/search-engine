We will take more measures and responsibility to prevent this from happening again,” the organization added.\nThe positive test is a blow for China, which will host the 2022 Winter Olympics.\nShi, 21, won a gold medal for the 500-metre sprint at the Junior Speedskating World Cup in 2016.\nReporting by Josephine Mason and Meng Meng; Editing by Greg Stutchbury\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-07T06:07:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-07T06:24:53.014+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
