Been speaking w(ith) many people about this and considering all options. Thank (yo)u for educating me I am learning all the time too.\" \nBut the black-and-white ad by The World Values Network questioned her decision to cancel the Tel Aviv performance but not one in Russia, with text below the image stating: \"Lorde joined a global anti-Semitic boycott of Israel but will perform in Russia, despite Putin's support for Assad's genocide in Syria.\" \nThe World Values Network states its mission is to disseminate Jewish values to the U.S., and its ad in The Washington Post is likely to have cost thousands of dollars. A full-page color ad in its Sunday edition is listed as costing $13,457 on its advertising rate card, although the cost for a black-and-white version is not listed. \nBoteach, who styles himself on his website as \"America's rabbi,\" has been a guest on \"The Oprah Winfrey Show.\" \nThe World Values Network, Universal Music (the parent company of Lorde's record label Republic Records) and the New Zealand government had not responded to CNBC's requests for comment at the time of publication.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-02T14:16:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-02T14:19:08.038+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
