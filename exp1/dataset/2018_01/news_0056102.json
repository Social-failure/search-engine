I know 100 percent that they’re not guilty of anything.”\nThe IOC last week released a list of 17 factors that were used to determine which Russians would be invited to the Games.\nIt said the selection panel had used information from an IOC probe into anti-doping violations at the Sochi Games to make its list, among other sources.\nRussian President Vladimir Putin (2nd L) poses for a selfie during a meeting with Russian athletes and team members, who will take part in the upcoming 2018 Pyeongchang Winter Olympic Games, at the Novo-Ogaryovo state residence outside Moscow, Russia January 31, 2018.

It’s not right.”\nSlideshow (7 Images) Addressing dozens of “Olympic Athletes from Russia” wearing their neutral grey and red uniforms, Putin said the country would do everything to support the athletes left out of the Games.\n“We will have a substantive discussion with our colleagues from international (sports) organizations,” Putin said. “We can figure all of this out.”\nIn an e-mail to Reuters, the IOC, which says it does not comment on individual cases, said panel members had gone “into detailed consideration of each individual athlete” in its selection of Russian competitors.\nSome athletes said the absence of team mates will provide additional motivation.\n“It’s a very difficult situation for the athletes who cannot go,” said Pavel Datsyuk, the captain of the country’s hockey team. “We will fight for them too.”\nReporting by Gabrielle Tétrault-Farber; Editing by Christian Radnedge\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-01-31T23:38:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-31T17:45:01.011+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
