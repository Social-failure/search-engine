I‘m confident that we as a team will achieve this.” \nWeimer’s comments are the first to staff after the former head of UniCredit’s business in Germany took the helm on Monday. \nHe succeeded Carsten Kengeter, who resigned last year amid an investigation into alleged insider trading that had its roots in the failed merger with the London Stock Exchange. Kengeter denied any wrongdoing. \n“We have everything that we need: a one-of-a-kind business model, technology that is valued by others, and a motivated and superbly educated team - to the extent I’ve been able to experience it so far,” Weimer wrote in the memo seen by Reuters. \nThe changing of the guard comes at an important moment for Deutsche Boerse. It hopes to profit from Britain’s decision to leave the European Union by capturing a portion of the lucrative euro clearing market that is currently centered in London. \nWeimer said he would hold a town hall meeting with staff in January. “It’s clear to me that this office that is being transferred to me requires a blend of leadership and instinct, a mix of giving direction and active listening,” he said.
