REUTERS/Patrick Hamilton \nSvitolina, ranked sixth in the world, fired 10 aces and never faced a break point on the way to a 10th career tour title. \nShe raced to a 3-0 lead before 23-year-old Belarusian Sasnovich found her range with some lethal backhands and briefly threatened to make it a contest. \nSvitolina, however, unleashed a series of powerful groundstrokes to break again and clinch the first set, before running away with the second to claim the title in just over an hour.

It was a good week for me.” \nSvitolina, having landed her first silverware of the season, heads to the Australian Open with her eyes fixed firmly on a maiden grand slam trophy. The tournament begins on Jan. 15 at Melbourne Park.
