That will be the easiest way to work together in the future,” Solberg told Reuters on the sidelines of a business conference.\n“If not we are prepared to negotiate in all of the areas. We feel we have a good cooperation both with Britain and the EU,” she added.\nNorway is western Europe’s top producer of oil and gas, and has an intricate network of pipes for transporting its natural gas to Britain, Germany and other European nations, but Brexit was unlikely to affect energy exports, Solberg said.\n“I don’t think it affects the energy sector for the cooperation in the our gas trade,” she added.\nReporting by Lefteris Karagiannopoulos; editing by Jeremy Gaunt\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-01-09T20:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-09T14:52:16.058+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
