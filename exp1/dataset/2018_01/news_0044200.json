He worked with Southampton boss Mauricio Pellegrino during their time at Argentina’s Estudiantes in 2015. \n“I am someone that will give my all, try my hardest and do whatever is asked of me by the manager,” Carrillo added. “I will show what I am about, I think we have good players and I think we can improve things.” \nSouthampton are winless in their last 11 league games, losing five times in that period. \n“Southampton have had a lot of games in a short space of time and if you look at the table, six points separates seven or eight teams in the table,” Carrillo said. “Hopefully we can win two or three games in a row and keep going that way.” Reporting by Shrivathsa Sridhar in Bengaluru; Editing by Peter Rutherford", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-26T04:41:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-26T08:21:17.014+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
