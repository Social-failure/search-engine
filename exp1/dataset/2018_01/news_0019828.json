REUTERS/Rebecca Cook \nIn a separate exchange with reporters, Reuss said GM intended to use its North American factories, including those in Mexico. \nBarra, who met in November with Vice President Mike Pence along with other U.S. auto executives, said GM has been working to educate the Trump administration about the complexities of the auto industry and its supply base. \n“We’re going to continue to work constructively to get a modernized NAFTA agreement,” she said. \nBarra said she was optimistic that NAFTA would survive. President Donald Trump has threatened to walk away from the 1994 accord unless major changes are made in negotiations with Mexico and Canada. \nOther GM executives defended the company’s North American manufacturing strategy, saying 80 percent of the trucks sold in the United States are made in U.S. factories. \nGM North America President Alan Batey said GM’s Mexican truck plant supports U.S. jobs. \n“The truck we build in Mexico, the engines come from the U.S. Everything is interlinked,” Batey told reporters after showing off the new Silverado. [nL1N1P80GX] \nAsked what GM would do if the United States pulls out of NAFTA, Batey said GM would “have to worry about that when we get there.” Reporting by David Shepardson; Editing by Will Dunham", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-01-14T10:13:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-14T05:32:33.006+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
