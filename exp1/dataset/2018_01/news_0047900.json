He said Russia had not put pressure on the delegation to attend.\nInternational concern has been rising over the fate of eastern Ghouta, where the United Nations says acute food and medicine shortages have contributed to the worst malnutrition seen in the Syrian civil war.\nThe enclave is home to almost 400,000 people and is in an agreed “de-escalation zone” under Russian-led truce deals for rebel-held territory, but the fighting there has continued.\nReporting By Angus McDowall Mark Potter\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-27T10:40:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-27T11:30:00.010+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
