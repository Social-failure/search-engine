You have to get in line and take it on,” Amla told SuperSport after Thursday’s play.\n“If you are not in line with the ball you might glove it. There is a lot in it for the seamers, you almost feel like you can get out any ball.”\nAmla tried to nullify the prodigious seam movement from the Indian bowlers by shuffling across to outside off-stump, an attempt to get in line with the ball to ensure that if he missed it, he could take a blow to the body rather than edge to the slip cordon.\n“Before I went out to bat I had the idea that I would try and get into the channel and play as straight as possible,” Amla said.\n”It’s just about trying to hit it. If you miss it, so be it, but on a wicket like this you have to have a plan and some days those plans work out.\n“AB (De Villiers) joked with me when he walked out (to bat) and said, ”that’s like scoring 150“, but I wish it was! You have to grind it out and get whatever runs you can. The element of fortune is quite big in situations like this.”\nNeither team has managed to top 200 in the test yet, but Amla believes his side could chase down more than that in the fourth innings.\n”I think about 250 ... even if it gets to 270,“ he said when asked what target South Africa could manage. ”You don’t know how the wicket is going to play, it hasn’t got significantly worse over the last two days.\n“If it gets to 250, as a batting unit you always feel like you have a chance.”\nSouth Africa have an unassailable 2-0 lead in the three-match series, but are seeking a first ever clean-sweep over India.\nReporting by Nick Said; Editing by Toby Davis\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-25T18:34:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-25T19:12:36.029+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
