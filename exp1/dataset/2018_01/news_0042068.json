The court also increased his sentence from nine to 12 years in prison for receiving a bribe from an engineering company vying for government contracts during his 2003-2010 presidency.\nReporting by Lisandra Paraguassú; Editing by Lisa Shumaker\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-01-25T03:58:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-25T10:10:55.009+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
