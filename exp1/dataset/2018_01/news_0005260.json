The GOP plan cuts the corporate tax rate to 21 percent.\nAs President Donald Trump's chief economic advisor, Cohn echoed Tepper's argument, saying that the tax stimulus will rev market growth in the coming year, spelling upside for investors.\n\"The stock market is the reflection of what is going on in the global economies, what companies are doing from an earnings perspective,\" said Cohn. \"I'm not sure people really understand the effect of tax reform in the stock market and we have yet to see the capital expenditure that's going to come through for five years of expensing.\"\nCohn's boss has not been shy about touting the gains in the market over his tenure, but this is the first time Cohn, the former No. 2 at Goldman Sachs, has been so blunt about the stock market's actual valuation.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-05T18:01:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-05T18:25:26.030+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
