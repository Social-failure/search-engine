[nL8N1PI1EY] \nNestle, the world’s largest packaged food firm, already announced in September plans to cut 450 out of 550 jobs at its Galderma skincare research center near Nice on the French Riviera. \nNestle has come under pressure to shift gear from activist shareholder Third Point, which in June revealed a $3.5 billion stake. Nestle has satisfied some demands, such as buying back shares and setting a margin target.
