It still kept it outlook for sales of 9-9.6 billion euros, pointing to stronger business in the second half of the year.\nSiemens, which retains a 59 percent in Siemens Gamesa, will report first-quarter results on Jan. 31.\n($1 = 0.8079 euros)\nEditing by Maria Sheahan and Alison Williams\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-01-30T19:54:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-31T16:25:57.033+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
