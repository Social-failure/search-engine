Profits rose about 55 percent and 19 percent, respectively, over the quarter.\nUNIQLO EXPANSION: INDIA NEXT? Famous for HeatTech thermal innerwear and ultra-lightweight down jackets, Uniqlo has grown through decades of deflation and weak consumption in Japan and is expanding steadily abroad.\nIn China, the retailer is moving into second- and third-tier cities with a target of hitting 1,000 stores in the Greater China region by 2021 from under 600 at end-2017.\nThe retailer would like to enter India in the near future, Okazaki said, as it tries to fulfil founder Tadashi Yanai’s ambition to overtake H&M and Zara parent Inditex as the world’s top apparel retailer.\nIt is already Asia’s biggest.\nIn Japan, the number of Uniqlo stores is likely to remain steady this year, as the retailer looks to improve profits by overhauling its distribution network and driving online traffic.\n7-ELEVEN SALES SLOW DOWN AT HOME But Japanese retailers could be running out of room to grow at home as indicated by lacklustre sales at 7-Eleven.\nSame-store sales at 7-Eleven in Japan fell year-on-year in October and November after 62 months of growth, while quarterly operating profit fell around 6 percent.\nIn addition to its nearly 20,000 local convenience stores, Seven & i has expanded to hold 8,500 convenience stores in the United States as it looks for growth avenues outside Japan.\nIt was strong sales abroad that helped Seven & i post a 9.5 percent rise in operating profit to 101.33 billion yen in the third quarter ended November.\n$1 = 111.6800 yen Reporting by Sam Nussey, Ritsuko Ando and Taiga Uranaka; Editing by Himani Sarkar\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-01-11T14:40:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-12T18:27:24.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
