REUTERS/Paco Chuquiure China’s financial deleveraging has pushed up money market rates, bond yields and corporate funding costs as broad M2 money supply growth hit a record low of 8.2 percent last year -- well below the official target of around 12 percent.\nThe weighted average lending rate for non-financial firms, a key indicator of corporate funding costs in China, rose by 49 basis points in the first nine months of 2017 to 5.76 percent, according to central bank data.\nZhu pointed to a 12 percent annual rise in total social financing -- a broad measure of credit and liquidity in the economy -- as evidence that the real economy was receiving adequate credit support.\nHe said China would continue to reform its financial sector and gradually open its capital account in coming years.\nBeijing will assess the possible impacts from U.S. President Donald Trump’s trade policy before deciding how to respond, Zhu said.\n“Trump’s trade policy against China is very unreasonable. China will continue to support the globalisation and the free trade flow,” he said, adding that a trade war with the United States would be “no good for anyone”.\nTrump said last week the United States was considering imposing a big “fine” as part of a probe into China’s alleged theft of intellectual property, the clearest indication that his administration would take retaliatory trade action.\nReporting by Kirsten Donovan in DAVOS, Divya Chowdhury in MUMBAI; Writing by Kevin Yao; Editing by Mark Bendeich\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-01-23T22:07:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-23T20:43:22.028+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
