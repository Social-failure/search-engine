Local residents will also be consulted on three options for the new runway and what the terminal infrastructure should be.\nHeathrow has pledged to keep costs down during the expansion, and said it had identified options to deliver the airport for 2.5 billion pounds less than previous plans thanks to engagement over the last year.\nWillie Walsh, chief executive of British Airways owner IAG , said Heathrow had to become cheaper for its expansion to succeed, in an article in the Financial Times earlier this week.\nAirlines UK, an industry association which represents UK-registered carriers, said that airlines might renege on their support for expansion if costs were not kept down.\n“Airlines have been consistent in their support for expansion at Heathrow and will be making the case for a new runway,” said Tim Alderslade, Chief Executive of Airlines UK.\n“However... this backing remains conditional upon costs being kept under control and passenger charges not increasing in real terms, and they will reserve the right to withdraw their support if this is not achievable.”\nReporting by Alistair Smout; editing by Stephen Addison\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-17T02:01:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-17T02:40:59.020+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
