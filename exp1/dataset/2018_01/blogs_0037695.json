That business was eventually acquired by Walgreens, and later shuttered.\n\"The specialist indicated that Amazon's decision to enter pharmacy has been in the works for some time,\" the report reads.\nAs CNBC has reported, Amazon has been busy in the last year meeting with folks across the industry, including generic drug makers, to figure out how it can break into the space.\nThe consumables team, led by Eric French, initially kicked off the research process. That team also includes the company's groceries product. In May, the company started interviewing for a pharmacy general manager to lead the team, and it has been looking to recruit health experts for months -- most recently, a health privacy lead. Amazon held exploratory talks in November with generic-drug makers like Sandoz and Mylan.\nAmazon's latest high-profile health care hire is Martin Levine , a doctor who specializes in new models of patient care.\nMatching prices, not beating them\nSome have speculated that Amazon could be a key player in bringing down drug prices.\nBut Leerink's analysts said the former member of Bezos' senior executive team suggested that Amazon will aim to match the lowest prices on the market, rather than beating them.\nThe note also says that Amazon will probably sell drugs directly to consumers, and build a platform open to all suppliers, similar to its Marketplace model. That could further spur price competition among drug makers.\nOverall, Amazon's move into the pharmacy business may seem like a foregone conclusion, but don't expect it to happen tomorrow. Some drug supply chain experts say that Amazon has lower-hanging fruit to explore first in the health care space, like selling cash-pay generic drugs and medical supplies.\n\"Its first and best opportunity remains in the cash-pay market for generic prescriptions,\" said Adam Fein, president of Pembroke Consulting.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-24T19:53:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-24T20:11:14.028+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
