Revenue grew 4 percent to $506 million, Israel’s largest technology company said on Wednesday.\nIt was forecast to earn $1.50 a share on revenue of $508.6 million, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.\nCheck Point’s shares were down 2 percent at $102.27 in early Nasdaq trading. The United States is Check Point’s biggest market, accounting for 40 percent of revenue.\n“We made a lot of changes in our sales organization in the U.S. and U.S. results are not where we want them to be,” Chief Executive Officer Gil Shwed told a news conference.\n“We have more work to do and it will take a few quarters until we see the results from the U.S. organizational changes.”\nOn a conference call with analysts he said he did not believe the weakness was due to increased competition from rival companies such as Palo Alto Networks ( PANW.N ).\nSome of the changes were made to help the company market its new product, Infinity Total Protection, a unified platform for network, cloud and mobile security.\n“Our industry is at an inflection point where cyber attacks are becoming increasingly more sophisticated and security infrastructure needs to significantly advance to effectively combat these threats,” Shwed said.\nInfinity is sold on an annual subscription basis rather than as a product. Check Point has been gradually moving more of its revenue to subscriptions, which now account for 70 percent of revenue, but these subscriptions boost deferred revenue at the expense of current revenue.\nCheck Point forecast 2018 earnings per share (EPS) excluding one-time items of $5.50-$5.90 on revenue of $1.9-$2.0 billion. Analysts on average were estimating EPS of $5.72 on revenue of $1.97 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.\nThe company attributed the wide range to uncertainty regarding how many clients would move over to Infinity.\nFor the first quarter Check Point forecast revenue of $440-$460 million and adjusted EPS of $1.25-$1.30. Analysts estimate revenue of $462 million and adjusted EPS of $1.32.\nAdditional reporting by Steven Scheer; Editing by Keith Weir\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-01-31T23:11:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-31T17:50:34.002+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
