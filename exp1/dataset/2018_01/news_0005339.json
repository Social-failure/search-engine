At the September meeting, for instance, he cited conversations with private equity investors that suggested to him the U.S. economy was still on good long-term footing.\nPowell said it was telling that, despite the ongoing crisis in Europe, private equity investors appeared eager to snap up U.S. companies.\nTheyre seeing something. They really are, he said, according to the transcript.\n(Reporting by Ann Saphir in San Francisco and Lindsay Dunsmuir and Jason Lange in Washington; Editing by Andrea Ricci)", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-05T19:19:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-07T03:42:12.030+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
