Eight of its 10 main sectors were higher, while consumer staples and discretionary groups weighed. \n* The materials group, which includes precious and base metals miners and fertilizer companies, added 1.0 percent. \n* Among the index’s most influential gainers were its biggest gold miners and marijuana producers, with Goldcorp Inc rising 4.5 percent to C$18.70, and Canopy Growth Corp jumping 9.6 percent to C$35.46. \n* The price of gold hit a four-month high as the U.S. dollar slumped, while cannabis companies were bouncing back after heavy falls late last week. \n* Cannabis companies have broadly jumped in recent months as Canada moves towards legalizing recreational use, but investors booked some profits last week after the U.S. federal government rescinded an order that had eased enforcement of federal law in states where the drug has been made legal. \n* Aurora Cannabis rose 7.6 percent to $11.10 and Aphria Inc surged 12.1 percent to C$20.20. \n* The energy group climbed 0.3 percent, while financials gained 0.2 percent, with Royal Bank of Canada up 0.5 percent to C$105.68.
