The U.S. airline index .DJUSAR was up 2.5 percent. \nAmerican Airlines said it now expects its total revenue per available seat mile for the quarter to rise about 5-6 percent, compared with its prior guidance of 2.5-4.5 percent. The company also raised its pre-tax margin forecast to 6.5-7.0 percent, from 4.5-6.5 percent. \n“The improvement in pre-tax margin is due to better than expected unit revenue in 4Q17,” Becker said. \nUnited, the No.3 U.S. airline, said on Tuesday it now expects fourth-quarter passenger unit revenue to be about flat, compared with its previous guidance of down 2 percent to flat. \n“We believe that many buysiders were already modeling for something in the -1 percent to flat neighborhood,” J.P. Morgan analyst Jamie Baker said. \n“The beat was driven by a combination of stronger overall yields as well as better than expected close-in demand, ordinarily a proxy for business travel. Frankly, we’re not surprised,” Baker said in a note. \nUnited, whose parent is United Continental Holdings ( UAL.N ), moved up its pre-tax margin guidance to 6-7 percent, from 3-4 percent. \nShares of Delta Air Lines ( DAL.N ) were up 2.4 percent. The company is scheduled to report fourth-quarter earnings on Thursday.
