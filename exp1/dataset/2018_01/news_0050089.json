(the “Company”), the parent of Chain Bridge Bank, N.A. (the “Bank”) (collectively, “Chain Bridge”), today reported that it earned $2.593 million, or $127.41 per share, in 2017, versus $2.995 million, or $147.36 per share, in 2016. The Company’s return on equity was 7.04% in 2017 versus 8.32% in 2016.\nThe reduction in the corporate income tax rates at year-end 2017 required the Company to take a one-time charge of $694 thousand for the re-measurement of its deferred tax asset. Excluding this one-time charge, 2017 net income was $3.287 million, or $161.51 per share, and return on equity was 8.92%.\nBook value per share was $1,872.34 at year-end 2017, versus $1,695.27 at year-end 2016. Excluding the unrealized loss on securities, book value per share was $1,942.35 at year-end 2017 versus $1,778.45 at year-end 2016.\nChain Bridge reported zero non-performing assets at December 31, 2017, the sixth consecutive year-end with zero non-performing assets.\nCapital Raise\nThe Company’s assets grew $120.0 million or 24.8% and stood at $603.6 million at year-end 2017. To support this growth, the Company sold 3,000 shares at $2,200 per share, almost entirely to existing shareholders. The sale of additional shares added $6.6 million to the Company’s capitalization. The Company’s Tier 1 risk- based capital ratio was 17.14% at year-end 2017.\nDeclaration of Dividend\nOn January 16, 2018 the Board of Directors declared a cash dividend of $15.00 per share, up from $14.75 per share in 2017 and $11.00 per share in 2016. The dividend is payable on February 15, 2018 to shareholders of record as of January 31, 2018. Future dividends will be contingent on the Company retaining sufficient capital to support anticipated business growth, fund strategic initiatives and provide continued support for depositors.\nChain Bridge Bank, N.A. is a national banking association organized under the laws of the United States and is the sole subsidiary of Chain Bridge Bancorp, Inc., a bank holding company registered with the Federal Reserve.
