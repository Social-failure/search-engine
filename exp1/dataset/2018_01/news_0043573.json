REUTERS/Alexander Nemenov/Pool \nUnder Putin, who has dominated the political landscape for the last 18 years, Russia has significantly increased defence spending and used military force in Georgia, Ukraine and Syria. \nExisting versions of the TU-160 have flown from bases in Russia to Syria where they have bombed forces opposed to President Bashar al-Assad, one of Moscow’s closest Middle East allies. \nTupolev, the plane’s manufacturer, says the modernised version will be 60 percent more effective than the older version with significant improvements to its weaponry, navigation and avionics. \nRinat Khamatov, the plant’s chief welder, said Russia needed a modernised version of the bomber. \n“The TU-160...is a weapon of deterrence and it is great that Russia is able to start making it again,” he told Reuters. \nRussia also aims to produce a modernised version of its Il-78 refuelling tanker, codenamed Midas by NATO, which can refuel the TU-160 mid-air, enabling it to reach any point on the planet.
