They say they didn’t like our broadcast,” Shaveddinov quipped on social media, sharing a photograph of himself from the airport in which two policemen were clearly visible. \nPolice took the pair to a Moscow police station and told them they would be kept in overnight until a court hearing, Shaveddinov wrote on Twitter. \nNavalny himself was detained for several hours on Sunday before being released without charge, his lawyer Olga Mikhailova told Reuters at the time, but would face court at a later date.
