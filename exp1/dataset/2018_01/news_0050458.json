(NASDAQ:AVIR) today issued the following statement in response to a report by Institutional Shareholder Services (“ISS”) regarding the Company’s proposed merger with Vaxart, Inc.:\n“ISS’s report contains numerous factual errors and we strongly believe that ISS has reached the wrong conclusion in failing to recommend that Aviragen stockholders vote FOR our proposed merger with Vaxart.\nISS’s recommendation relies on “the hope that the board finds another transaction that adequately compensates shareholders for Aviragen's assets (cash, a public listing, and a royalty stream).” i However, ISS itself notes that voting against the transaction carries significant risk “as the board appears to have already run an extensive process before selecting Vaxart as a merger candidate.” i\nSince the announcement on April 4, 2017, Aviragen conducted a public seven-month review of strategic alternatives; having considered 167 parties for strategic transactions, Aviragen sent non-confidential materials to 65 parties and received indications of interest from 16 parties, including numerous unsolicited inbound inquiries. No other parties have expressed interest in a transaction with Aviragen since the proposed merger with Vaxart was announced three months ago. Given the public nature of this review, Aviragen does not understand how ISS can conclude that a more attractive candidate than Vaxart may emerge. Should Aviragen stockholders vote against the transaction, it is unlikely that another strategic option will emerge.\nAviragen notes that after the merger closes, there will only be $5 million of debt outstanding. In its analysis, ISS incorrectly states that following the merger, the combined company may have to address its high leverage based on Vaxart’s $33.1 million in net debt. In fact, nearly all of Vaxart’s debt will convert to equity as part of the transaction – and it will convert at $1.44 per share, a substantial premium over the current share price of $0.60.\nISS asserts that stockholders would benefit from preserving their liquidation option, but in its analysis fails to indicate that the liquidation value of $22.4 million in the proxy was calculated as of October 31, 2017. Given the passage of time and the costs of the Company’s ongoing clinical trial and the pending proxy contest with the group led by Digirad, the Company expects to spend approximately $8 million between last October and June 30, 2018, at which point the Company expects to obtain topline data from the ongoing trial. Given the timing of topline data, Aviragen notes that June 30, 2018 is the earliest it could consider liquidating the Company.\nBy voting down the proposed merger with Vaxart, stockholders leave open the possibility that the group led by Digirad – with no alternative plans for growing the Company, a proposed Board slate with no experience in the biotechnology industry to evaluate the Company’s assets, and a chairman found to have violated securities law – could still take control of the Board.\nISS has understated the chance of success for Vaxart’s products. Vaxart has recently completed a successful Phase 2 clinical trial in which its influenza tablet vaccine performed very well against the market-leading injectable flu vaccine, proving that its oral tablet vaccine delivery technology works in humans. Vaxart’s second program, a novel oral vaccine for norovirus, has already demonstrated robust immune responses in human clinical trials. The proposed merger with Vaxart will create a leading vaccine company with multiple opportunities for value creation. Importantly, the combined company will be well-financed with little debt and a cash runway through the second quarter of 2019. The combined company will be led by an experienced biotechnology management and directorial team, maximizing the likelihood of success.\nAviragen’s Board and management team continue to believe approving the proposed merger with Vaxart represents the best path forward for Aviragen and its stockholders. Accordingly, Aviragen strongly recommends stockholders vote FOR the proposed merger with Vaxart.”\nEACH VOTE IS IMPORTANT – PLEASE VOTE FOR THE PROPOSED MERGER WITH VAXART TODAY - EACH VOTE IS IMPORTANT\nThe Aviragen Board unanimously recommends that stockholders vote FOR the proposed merger. Each vote is extremely important, no matter how many or how few shares are owned. The affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the shares of Aviragen common stock properly cast at the Aviragen Special Meeting, presuming a quorum is present, is required to approve the proposed merger.
