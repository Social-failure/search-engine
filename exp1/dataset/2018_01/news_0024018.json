Still, Qatar’s economy has generally weathered the dispute and banks should gain support in 2018 as the government moderately ramps up spending.\nMasraf Al Rayan said its board was recommending a dividend for 2017 of 2 riyals per share, the same level as the previous year.\nIn a deal that would create Qatar’s second-largest bank, Masraf Al Rayan is in initial merger talks with Barwa Bank and International Bank of Qatar.\nFor the full-year of 2017, the sharia-compliant bank posted net profit of 2.03 billion riyals, lower than the 2.08 billion riyals it reported the previous year.
