The other two co-owners have announced plans to divest their shares of the brand as well and make them available to employees until the company is 100% employee-owned. \nBritta Leijonflycht, one of the women mentioned in the lawsuit against Tooker, says the move to keep the company’s name represents the owners backtracking on promises.
