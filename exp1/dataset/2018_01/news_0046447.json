(\"Bank\") and its insurance, investments and equipment financing subsidiaries, today announced financial results and year ended December 31, 2017. Univest reported net income of $10.3 million, or $0.37 diluted earnings per share for the three months ended December 31, 2017, compared to net income of $6.9 million, or $0.26 diluted earnings per share, for the three months ended December 31, 2016. Net income for the year ended December 31, 2017 was $44.1 million, or $1.64 diluted earnings per share, compared to net income of $19.5 million, or $0.84 diluted earnings per share for the year ended December 31, 2016.\nThe financial results for the quarter and year ended December 31, 2017 included a revaluation of the Corporation’s net deferred tax asset associated with the passage of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (“TCJA”). The revaluation, which is recorded as additional income tax expense, was $1.1 million, or $0.04, of diluted earnings per share for each period. The financial results for the year ended December 31, 2017 also included a tax-free bank owned life insurance (\"BOLI\") death benefit of $889 thousand recognized in the second quarter of 2017, which represents $0.03 diluted earnings per share for the year ended December 31, 2017.\nThe financial results and year ended December 31, 2016 included acquisition and integration costs related to the acquisition of Fox Chase Bancorp (\"Fox Chase\") plus restructuring costs related to facility closures and staffing rationalization of $1.2 million and $11.8 million, net of tax, or $0.05 and $0.51, of diluted earnings per share, respectively. There were no acquisition, integration costs or restructuring costs during the year ended December 31, 2017. The results and year ended December 31, 2016 also included $1.2 million, net of tax, or $0.05 and $0.05, of diluted earnings per share, respectively, related to the Corporation’s agreement to settle its future obligations related to its acquisition of Girard Partners, Inc.\nAdditionally, on December 6, 2017, the Corporation completed its public offering of 2,645,000 shares of common stock at a price of $28.25 per share which resulted in an increase in shareholders' equity of $70.5 million.\nLoans\nGross loans and leases increased $334.2 million, or 10.2%, from December 31, 2016 and $132.9 million, or 15.2% (annualized), from September 30, 2017. The growth in loans in the fourth quarter and year ended 2017 was primarily in commercial real estate, commercial business and residential real estate loans.\nDeposits\nTotal deposits increased $297.4 million, or 9.1%, from December 31, 2016 and increased $36.3 million, or 4.1% (annualized), from September 30, 2017. Noninterest bearing deposits increased $121.7 million, or 13.3%, from December 31, 2016. The growth in deposits in 2017 was primarily due to increases in commercial and public funds deposits partially offset by a decrease in consumer deposits.\nShareholders’ Equity\nShareholders’ equity increased $98.2 million from December 31, 2016 primarily due to the previously mentioned public offering which raised $70.5 million and net income of $44.1 million, partially offset by dividends declared to shareholders of $21.8 million. Tangible book value per share, as defined in the attached exhibits, increased to $14.44 per share at December 31, 2017 from $12.13 at December 31, 2016.\nNet Interest Income and Margin\nNet interest income of $143.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 increased $29.0 million, or 25.3%, from the prior year. Net interest income of $36.7 million of 2017 decreased $181 thousand, or 0.5%, from the third quarter of 2017 and increased $2.5 million, or 7.4%, from the fourth quarter of 2016. Net interest margin, on a tax-equivalent basis, was 3.76% of 2017, compared to 3.80% for the third quarter of 2017 and 3.81% of 2016. The favorable impact of purchase accounting accretion was 4 basis points ($449 thousand) for the quarter ended December 31, 2017 compared to 11 basis points ($1.1 million) for the quarter ended September 30, 2017 and 20 basis points ($1.8 million) for the quarter ended December 31, 2016. Excluding the impact of purchase accounting accretion, the net interest margin, on a tax-equivalent basis, was 3.72% for the quarter ended December 31, 2017 compared to 3.69% for the quarter ended September 30, 2017 and 3.61% for the quarter ended December 31, 2016.\nNoninterest Income\nNoninterest income for the year ended December 31, 2017 was $59.2 million, an increase of $3.3 million, or 5.9%, from the prior year. Noninterest income for the quarter ended December 31, 2017 was $14.2 million, a decrease of $158 thousand, or 1.1%, from the fourth quarter of 2016. Trust fee income increased $314 thousand, or 4.1%, for the year ended December 31, 2017 primarily due to an increase in trust assets under management during 2017. Service charges on deposits increased $791 thousand, or 16.9%, for the year ended December 31, 2017 primarily due to fees on deposit accounts acquired from Fox Chase. Investment advisory commission and fee income increased $2.0 million, or 17.8%, for the year ended December 31, 2017 primarily due to new customer relationships and favorable market performance during 2017. Insurance commission and fee income increased $185 thousand, or 1.3%, for the year ended December 31, 2017. Insurance contingent commission income was $1.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, a decrease of $363 thousand from the year ended December 31, 2016. Excluding the decrease in contingent commission income, insurance commission and fee income increased $548 thousand or 4.2%. BOLI income increased $1.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, primarily due to proceeds from BOLI death benefits of $889 thousand recognized in the second quarter of 2017 and policies acquired from Fox Chase. BOLI death benefits of $450 thousand were recognized in the fourth quarter of 2016. Other income increased $1.4 million, or 17.1%, for the year ended December 31, 2017, mainly due to an increase in service fee income of $820 thousand, an increase in swap fee income of $308 thousand and an increase in net gains on sales of other real estate owned of $524 thousand partially offset by the loss on the sale of a closed Fox Chase branch of $309 thousand.\nThese increases in noninterest income were partially offset by a decrease in the net gain on sale of securities of $470 thousand for the year ended December 31, 2017. In addition, the net gain on mortgage banking decreased $2.0 million, or 33.3%, for the year ended December 31, 2017 primarily due to a decrease in mortgage refinance volume and a shortage of housing supply.\nNoninterest Expense\nNoninterest expense for the year ended December 31, 2017 was $130.7 million, a decrease of $11.3 million, or 7.9%, from the prior year. Noninterest expense for the quarter ended December 31, 2017 was $33.4 million, a decrease of $5.0 million, or 13.0%, compared to the fourth quarter of 2016. Included in the fourth quarter 2017 other expense is $279 thousand of expense associated with an unauthorized mortgage loan disbursement.\nAcquisition and integration costs related to the Fox Chase acquisition and restructuring costs were $17.7 million for the year and $2.2 million for the quarter ended December 31, 2016. There were no acquisition, integration costs or restructuring costs during the year ended December 31, 2017. In addition, intangible expense decreased $2.2 million for the quarter and $2.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 primarily as a result of the settlement of the Girard Partners Inc. acquisition earn-out in the fourth quarter of 2016 and the conclusion of the earn-out period for the Sterner Insurance Associates acquisition, which resulted in a reversal of a prior accrual of $303 thousand during the second quarter of 2017.\nThese decreases were partially offset by the following increases in non-interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2017. Salaries, benefits and commissions increased $5.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, primarily attributable to higher staffing levels resulting from the Fox Chase acquisition, additional staff hired to support revenue generation across all business lines and the expansion into Lancaster County. Premises and equipment expenses increased $1.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, primarily due to higher premises expense related to Fox Chase locations and expansion into Philadelphia, Lancaster County and the Lehigh Valley. Data processing expense increased $1.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 due to increased investments in customer relationship management software and outsourced data processing solutions as well as the addition of Fox Chase processing expense. Other expense increased $1.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 primarily due to an increase of $1.1 million related to Bank shares tax as a result of a statutory rate increase in 2017 and the Bank’s growth following the Fox Chase acquisition.\nAsset Quality and Provision for Loan and Lease Losses\nNon-accrual loans and leases, including non-accrual troubled debt restructured loans, were $14.5 million at December 31, 2017, compared to $15.9 million at September 30, 2017 and $17.9 million at December 31, 2016. Nonperforming assets were $28.6 million at December 31, 2017, compared to $30.8 million at September 30, 2017 and $27.1 million at December 31, 2016. Net loan and lease charge-offs were $980 thousand during the fourth quarter of 2017 and $5.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. The provision for loan and lease losses was $2.0 million of 2017 and $9.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2017.\nThe allowance for loan and lease losses as a percentage of loans and leases held for investment, excluding covered loans acquired in the Fox Chase and Valley Green Bank acquisitions, which were recorded at fair value as of the acquisition date, was 0.70% at December 31, 2017, compared to 0.71% at September 30, 2017 and 0.73% at December 31, 2016.\nTax Provision\nThe effective income tax rate was 28.7% for the year and 33.5% for the quarter ended December 31, 2017, respectively. The effective income tax rate was impacted by the previously discussed revaluation adjustment of the deferred tax asset of $1.1 million in the fourth quarter, the BOLI death benefit of $889 thousand in the second quarter and by the adoption of ASU 2016-9. Excluding these items, the effective tax rate was 28.5% for the year ended December 31, 2017.\nDividend\nOn December 4, 2017, Univest declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.20 per share, payable on January 2, 2018. This represented a 2.87% annualized yield based on the closing price of Univest’s stock on the date the dividend was paid.\nConference Call\nUnivest will host a conference call to discuss fourth quarter and year end 2017 results on Thursday, January 25, 2018 at 9:00 a.m. EST.
