In some cases, eateries can also be a way to make the most out of large, city-centre store sites as customers increasingly shop online.\nThe Gucci restaurant is sited behind the walls of the 14-century Palazzo della Mercanzia building, overlooking the city’s most famous square, Piazza della Signoria. Visitors can treat themselves to the likes of Parmigiano Reggiano tortellini, Peruvian-inspired tostadas, pork belly buns and mushroom risotto for 20-30 euros per dish.\nFew strategies come without an element of risk, however.\nBernstein analyst Mario Ortelli said that if luxury companies did not provide a gastronomic experience that matched their other goods, it could dilute their brands. “The experience has to be luxurious and recognizable,” he said.\nWhile labels are looking to these investments for marketing rather than profits, a presence in food could offer some financial returns in the long run.\nWith a global luxury market estimated to be worth 1.2 trillion euros in 2017, sales of luxury wines and spirits and food, together worth just under 120 billions, last year grew 6 percent, more than personal luxury goods such as bags, shoes and clothing, according to Bain & Co’s yearly report on the sector.\n“Food is luxury as much as fashion,” said Stefano Cantino, strategic marketing director at Prada, which owns exclusive Milan patisserie Marchesi.\n“Barriers have been broken.”\nThe Gucci Osteria restaurant is part of “Gucci Garden”, which includes an exhibition area, a bazaar-like boutique and a cinema room. “Haute couture and haute cuisine are a recipe made in heaven,” Bottura told reporters.\n(This version of the story has been refiled to fix typo in ‘branch’ in fourth paragraph)\nReporting by Giulia Segreti; Editing by Pravin Char\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-09T18:04:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-09T18:28:33.010+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
