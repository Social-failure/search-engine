A Mass he has planned to hold on Tuesday in a Santiago park is expected to attract more than 500,000 people.\nProtests on issues ranging from indigenous rights to the Church’s ongoing sexual abuse scandal are expected.\nFrancis will also visit the south-central city of Temuco and Iquique, which is farther north, before heading to Peru, where he will stop in Lima, Puerto Maldonado and Trujillo.\nReporting by Antonio De la Jara; Writing by Dave Sherwood; Editing by Lisa Von Ahn\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-12T14:54:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-12T15:14:09.020+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
