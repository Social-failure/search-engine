Having route approval in Nebraska and the necessary commercial support for KXL brings us closer to a final investment decision,” TransCanada spokesman Terry Cunha said in an email.\nWhen completed, the Keystone XL will run about 1,180 miles (1,899 km) from Hardisty, Alberta, to Steele City, Nebraska, linking crude from the oil-rich but landlocked Canadian province with U.S. refineries.\nPrimary construction is expected to begin in 2019, TransCanada said.\nLast year, the Donald Trump administration granted the company a federal permit, reversing a decision by former President Barack Obama to reject the project on environmental grounds.\nThe project cleared its final hurdle in November when Nebraska approved a path for the project through the state.\n“Interest in the project remains strong and TransCanada will look to continue to secure additional long-term contracted volumes,” the company said in a statement.\nToronto-listed shares of the company were trading down 0.3 percent at C$59.63.
