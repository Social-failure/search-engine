Christian Dior ( DIOR.PA ) and Kering ( PRTP.PA ) were up 4.2 and 2.6 percent respectively. \nSwiss banking software group Temenos ( TEMN.S ) ended down 3.3 percent but was the biggest gainer in Europe before it denied being approached for a takeover. \nThe Swiss software firm, which is subject to regular takeover speculation, jumped as much as 18 percent on Thursday. \nKepler Cheuvreux raised its price target on Temenos on Friday, pointing to positive comments by Nordic bank Nordea regarding the integration of a Temenos banking platform. \nAmong other gainers were Telia ( TELIA.ST ), up 3.8 percent, after the telecom operator lifted its dividend, while shares in Michelin ( MICP.PA ) and Thales ( TCFP.PA ) were buoyed by upbeat broker comments. \nA disappointing update however sent Norwegian insurer Gjensidige ( GJFS.OL ) down 6.6 percent. The company posted below-forecast profits for the fourth quarter and proposed a lower-than-expected full-year dividend. \nSpeciality baker Aryzta ( ARYN.S ) fell 8.8percent as some brokers downgraded the stock following a profit warning that wiped out one fifth of its market value on Thursday. \nAccording to Thomson Reuters data 80 percent of the MSCI Europe companies that have reported so far have beaten fourth-quarter earning expectations and 12 percent have missed them.
