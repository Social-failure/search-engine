The second, about 15 minutes later, inflicted a large number of casualties among people who had gathered at the scene. Slideshow (6 Images) \nSenior security officials were among the casualties. \nThe toll was one of the highest from a single attack since Libya slid into turmoil after the uprising that toppled Muammar Gaddafi in 2011. \nBenghazi is controlled by the Libyan National Army (LNA), which is led by powerful eastern-based commander Khalifa Haftar and was battling Islamists and other opponents in the port city until late last year.
