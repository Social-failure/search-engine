REUTERS/Brendan McDermid/File Photo McMahon also emphasized the importance of players showing character, noting that if a player had a DUI on his record he would be ineligible to play.\nThe NFL has come under fire in recent years for its handling of players accused of crimes including domestic violence.\nMcMahon’s announcement gained traction on Twitter with #XFL2020 becoming the top trending hashtag in the United States.\n“Well well well, how are you doing over there @VinceMcMahon and @alphaentllc? I see you may be looking for some athletes,” former New York Giants quarterback Jared Lorenzen wrote on Twitter. “I got ya. May be I do have 1 more comeback left me.”\nHeisman Trophy winner and former Cleveland Browns quarterback Johnny Manziel (@Jmanziel2) tweeted: “#XFL2020 @VinceMcMahon.”\nMcMahon said the cities for the eight teams would be determined later. He said the league, not individual franchises, will own the teams.\nThe focus for now would be improving the play on the field, he said, admitting that it had not been good enough to attract fans the first time around.\n“Quite frankly we only had a very short time in the past to put everything together,” McMahon said. “Now we have two years to get it right.”\nReporting by Rory Carroll in Los Angeles; Additional reporting by Amy Tennery in New York; Editing by Lisa Shumaker and Daniel Wallis\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-25T23:58:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-26T00:09:21.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
