It’s definitely special, including being here in Australia,” the Florida-based Korda said after his 7-6(6) 6-4 win. “My sister won her first title here, as well. My dad won his only grand slam title here, so it’s very special.” \nKorda’s sister Jessica is a golfer and won her first professional title, the Women’s Australian Open, in Melbourne in 2012. \nWhile his dad was back home watching on television rather than in Melbourne, Korda said his victory made up for missing his 50th birthday last week. \n“The main goal was try to get this tournament for my dad on his 50th birthday,” he said. \nKorda, who is also a two handicap golfer, admitted his dad’s victory is regular viewing at home. \n“I’ve seen his match on YouTube a lot. I watch it at least maybe once a month. A little bit of motivation,” he said.
