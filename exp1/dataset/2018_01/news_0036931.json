Tariffs are scheduled to be eliminated by 2019 under the free trade deal.\nAustralia’s quarter-share of the Chinese wine market is still only a little more than half that of France‘s.\nBut the cracking pace of China sales is benefiting major exporters such as Australia’s Treasury Wine Estates, the world’s biggest standalone winemaker, which reported a 55 percent profit rise last August as Asia sales surged.\nTreasury declined to comment on Tuesday ahead of its Feb. 15 earnings announcement.\nIt’s also lured Chinese producers to look at Australian terroir, with the purchase last month of a majority stake in Clare Valley vineyard Kilikanoon by Yantai Changyu Pioneer Wine Co Ltd for $15.5 million, following several smaller deals in recent years.\nSales to the next top export markets behind China, the U.S. and Britain each fell 2 percent. Sales to Canada, where restrictions on foreign sales last week prompted an Australian complaint to the World Trade Organisation, fell 3 percent to A$187 million.\nIn volume terms, total exports grew 8 percent to a record high of 811 million litres for the calendar year, while at the same time, worldwide production hit its lowest since 1961.\nNineteen percent of Australia’s wine by volume was sold in China.\nThe fastest-growing segment of the export market was for expensive wine valued at more than A$200 per bottle.
