Charities and trusts falling within the new thresholds would also be eligible. \nThe FCA set out its proposals in a 64-page consultation paper. Final rules will be published in the summer and come into force on Dec. 1. TOO WEAK \nThe FCA said the proposals go as far as its powers allow without the need for a new law. \nBut the All Party Parliamentary Group (APPG) on fair business banking and finance said the proposals don’t go far enough, and that a specialist transition tribunal could be set up without the need for a new law. \n“We call upon the FCA and the Treasury to work with us to make sure we deliver the right solution as quickly as possible,” said Kevin Hollinrake, APPG vice-chair. \nThe Federation of Small Businesses said many critical reforms were needed that go beyond a simple change in who can complain to the ombudsman. \n“Alongside a much needed expansion of the FOS, we need to give serious consideration to legislating for a separate dispute mechanism,” the federation said. \nRBS and Lloyds set up voluntary compensation schemes after lending and business turnaround scandals involving small companies, but the two schemes have been criticised by firms for being unfair. \nLawmakers published last week a “Just Hit Budget!” sales memo from RBS’s former business restructuring unit, which said “Rope: Sometimes you need to let customers hang themselves.” \n“As long as a complainant is eligible, the ombudsman can consider complaints about any regulated activity; it can also consider complaints about some unregulated activities, such as, lending to companies or the activities of business turnaround units,” the FCA said. \nThe watchdog said its proposals will provide access to the FOS for more than 80 percent of the approximately 200,000 small and medium sized enterprises that are not currently eligible. \nThe FOS can order a bank to pay redress of up to 150,000 pounds, and raising this limit would require legislation.
