I think it’s very difficult to successfully complete deals we cannot do alone.” \nAnalysts say Japan Tobacco would likely be unable to buy Imperial’s entire business and would need to join forces with other buyers to clear antitrust hurdles, given Imperial’s big market presence in United Kingdom and other countries.
