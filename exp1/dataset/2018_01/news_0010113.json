He settled me in and I was able to get into the round and stay patient until I got hot,” he said. \n“I think the experience I got in Mexico is invaluable and I’ll be able to use that tomorrow.” Reporting by Andrew Both in Cary, North Carolina; Editing by John O'Brien", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-14T07:17:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-14T07:37:37.015+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
