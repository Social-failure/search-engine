That complex, located near residential and commercial buildings, likely experienced a large explosion but The Diplomat said it was impossible to determine whether there were casualties.\nThe prospect of nuclear war breaking out on the Korean Peninsula dominated global headlines for the last year, but many analysts believe the risk of a nuclear accident could be an even greater threat amid Pyongyang's lax safety regulations.\nRead The Diplomat's story for more details about the crash. \nWATCH: Bitcoin mining — a new way for North Korea to make money show chapters Bitcoin mining — a new way for North Korea to make money      9:37 AM ET Wed, 13 Sept 2017 | 03:43", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-04T08:36:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-04T08:35:44.040+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
