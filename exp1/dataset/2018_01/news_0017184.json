The index was down 0.92 percent at 91.008, after slipping to a four-month low of 90.954.\nA sharp rise in the British pound also dragged the index lower. Sterling rocketed to its highest level against the dollar since the vote to leave the European Union, after a report that the Netherlands and Spain were open to a deal for Britain to remain as close as possible to the trading bloc.\n\"Anytime you hear Brexit going well it is going to give the pound a little bit of a boost,\" said Trang.\nSterling was up 1.43 percent to $1.3729.\nGiven the strong momentum in the euro and sterling, the dollar failed to capitalise on data which showed underlying U.S. consumer prices recorded their largest increase in 11 months in December, which bolstered expectations that inflation will accelerate this year.\n\"It may be a bit premature to jump on the inflation bandwagon. I would want to see at least a quarter or two of some solid numbers,\" Trang said.\nBitcoin was 3.8 percent higher at $13,749.05 on the Luxembourg-based Bitstamp exchange a day after it skidded over 11 percent after the government of South Korea said it was considering a plan to ban cryptocurrency trading.\n(Reporting by Saqib Iqbal Ahmed, Editing by Rosalba O'Brien)", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-12T22:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-13T06:17:02.017+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
