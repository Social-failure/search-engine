(\"Innovus Pharma\" or the “Company”) (OTCQB Venture Market: INNV), an emerging commercial-stage pharmaceutical company that delivers safe, innovative and effective over-the-counter medicine and consumer care products to improve men’s and women's health and respiratory diseases, today announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) has cleared its UriVarx® Urinary Tract Infection (“UTI”) test strips under the 510(k) filing of its manufacturing partner, ACON Laboratories, Inc. (“ACON”). Innovus Pharma will offer the recently cleared UriVarx® UTI test strips, which provide results in 2-minutes, to its customers who buy its UriVarx® product. The UTI test strips are complementary to the Company’s UriVarx® supplement currently on the market and clinically tested in patients with overactive bladder (“OAB”) and urinary incontinence (“UI”). The UTI test strips will also be offered separately by Innovus Pharma and are manufactured by ACON. Innovus Pharma currently is expected to launch the UTI strips in Q1 2018.\nAccording to WebMD, UTIs are the most common bacterial infections in the United States. According to a study by the National Institutes of Health in 2007 (NIH publication 075512) by Griebling et al., the prevalence of UTI is found to be higher in women. Nearly 20% of UTIs are found in men. Patients with OAB and UI have a higher occurrence of UTI infections and early detection is key in better responses to treatments.\n“We are very pleased that ACON has secured the FDA clearance of the UriVarx® UTI test strips,” stated Dr. Bassam Damaj, President and Chief Executive Officer of Innovus Pharma. “We look forward to launching the UriVarx® strips with our UriVarx® clinical supplement for bladder health to enable our customers to be able to use our FDA cleared UTI test strips to monitor ongoing bladder infections from the convenience of their homes. We expect the addition of the UTI strips to increase our clinical supplement sales and the average life cycle of our monthly product subscriptions,” he continued.\nThe Company recently announced the approval of UriVarx® by Health Canada and the signing of a commercial license agreement with Acerus Pharmaceuticals Corporation in Canada for the product.\nAbout UriVarx® Clinical Supplement\nUriVarx® is clinically published to reduce urinary urgency, accidents and both day and night frequency in OAB and UI patients.\nUriVarx® has undergone two double blind and comparative trials in both male and female OAB and UI patients. The clinical results include:\nReduction of ~56% in Urge Incontinence; Reduction of ~66% in Stress Incontinence; Reduction of ~61% in Urinary Urgency; Reduction of ~33% in Urinary Frequency meaning the total average urinary frequency was in the normal/ideal range after two months of use; and Reduction of ~46% in Nocturia.\nAccording to the U.S. National Association for Continence (“NAFC”), OAB is a medical term that describes various symptoms caused by involuntary bladder spasms, including urinary frequency, especially at night, and urgency with or without involuntary leakage. These symptoms may occur without obvious cause or be secondary to certain diseases of the nervous system. The NAFC estimates that nearly 25 million Americans suffer from some form of OAB or incontinence. The condition, with frequency and urgency only, affects men and women of all ages, although most are under age 65.\nAbout the UriVarx® FDA Cleared UTI Test\nThe UriVarx® UTI test strips are FDA-cleared tests for the detection of leukocytes and nitrites to add in the screening of Urinary Tract Infection for self-testing. The test has undergone clinical trials and the results can be seen in two minutes.\nAccording to a study by Grand View Research (April 2016), the market size for urinalysis tests in 2015 worldwide was $1.37 billion and in North America was $510 million of which UTI testing represented a large percentage of that market.\nAbout Innovus Pharmaceuticals, Inc.\nHeadquartered in San Diego, Innovus Pharma is an emerging OTC consumer goods and specialty pharmaceutical company engaged in the commercialization, licensing and development of safe and effective non-prescription medicine and consumer care products to improve men’s and women’s health and vitality and respiratory diseases.
