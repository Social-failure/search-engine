That team finished eighth, winning just one game and bowing out in the quarter-finals, so the NHL’s snub offered him a second chance to add an Olympic medal to his trophy cabinet.\n“It’s one thing I haven’t been able to accomplish is an Olympic medal, an Olympic gold medal,” Gionta said.\n“At this point, to be able to go out with that would be unbelievable.”\nThe U.S. team, however are long odds to win any medal.\nFILE PHOTO: Mar 5, 2017; Pittsburgh, PA, USA;Ê Buffalo Sabres left wing Tyler Ennis (63) and right wing Brian Gionta (12) celebrate a power play goal by Gionta against the Pittsburgh Penguins during the first period at the PPG PAINTS Arena. Mandatory Credit: Charles LeClaire-USA TODAY Sports/File Photo While there are 15 players with NHL experience, Gionta alone accounts for roughly a third of the total games played between them and the majority of the squad now play professionally in Europe.\nThere are also three from the North American minor league system and four still in college.\nThe majority of the players were involved in last year’s Deutschland Cup in Germany, where they failed to win any of their three games.\nGionta, however, said the time spent together had been valuable for their Olympic preparations.\n“We came together as a group,” Gionta said. “It gave us a nice taste of everyone getting used to each other.”\nTo keep in game shape, Gionta has been doing daily workouts with the Rochester Americans, the Sabres’ minor league affiliate about an hour’s drive from his house. Practicing but not playing can have some advantages, he said.\n“Your body’s not getting worn down from the pounding of the games,” he said.\n“So I feel fresh, especially considering where I’ve been the last few years.”\nClearly, though, Gionta faces a big challenge in helping head coach Tony Granato turn the team into a medal contender, with just a handful of practices in Pyeongchang before their first game against Slovenia on Feb. 14.\nGionta, however, said all the teams are in the same boat, scrambling for alternative talent without the NHL players.\n“You’re pulling from the same talent pool. The NHL guys are taken out of that, and from there, you deal with it,” he said.\n“But I like our chances for sure.”\nEditing by Greg Stutchbury\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-25T15:18:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-25T15:26:49.001+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
