The amount that states pay governors, congressmen and senators varies greatly.\nFor instance, Zippia reports that the governor of Pennsylvania is paid approximately $187,818 a year, and the governor of Maine is paid $70,000. They found that the range is even more pronounced among state representatives. In California, state representatives make close to $100,000 a year while representatives from New Hampshire are paid just $100 a year.\nZippia analyzed data from 50 states in order to calculate how much each state paid politicians. The site considered three factors: cost of living , governor's wage and state representative wages . Since states pay their representatives differently, Zippia calculated their wages by adding their base pay and estimating per diem allowances that would be provided over the length of the average session. Zippia's data is from 2014, and does not include expenses. \n\n\n\n\nHere are the five states that pay their politicians the most:\n5. West Virginia Governor salary: $150,000\nState representative salary: $27,860.\n4. Michigan Governor salary: $159,300\nState representative salary: $71,685\n3. Tennessee Governor salary: $181,980\nState representative salary: $38,704\n2. Ohio Governor salary: $148,886\nState representative salary: $60,584\n1.

Pennsylvania pays their governors more than any other state and pays their representatives more than every state except for California.\nCalifornia actually has the highest paid representatives, but did not crack the top five because of the high cost of living in the golden state. Governors of California are paid the seventh most in the nation, behind states like Virginia, Illinois and Tennessee.\nZippia calculates that New Hampshire has the lowest paid politicians. In New Hampshire, Governors are paid $121,896 but representatives are paid just $200 for every two-year term and they do not receive per diem wages. That means over the course of a year, a congressperson from New Hampshire would earn just $100.\nLike this story?
