The median balance in a 401(k) account was $24,713, according to Vanguard .\nUnlike bonuses, which employees could either save up or blow on shopping , an increase to a retirement plan match is useful for workers' long-term financial planning, said Gregg Levinson, senior retirement consultant at Willis Towers Watson.\nWhether more employers will boost their 401(k) match in response to the tax law remains to be seen.\n\"The downside is that if the economy or the tax rules change, they've made a promise to employees that is going to be hard to scale back,\" said Levinson.\nSmaller firms, which have fewer resources, may raise wages or give a one-time bonus, as opposed to raising their 401(k) plan matches.\n\"It's a one-time benefit,\" Levinson said. \"You get the good will, but you're not on the hook.\"\nâ€” CNBC's Darla Mercado contributed to this report.\nWATCH: Big money lines up to sell GOP tax plan\nshow chapters Big money lines up to sell GOP tax plan in hopes it translates into political victory 7 Hours Ago | 01:48", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-08T18:53:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-08T20:26:57.010+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
