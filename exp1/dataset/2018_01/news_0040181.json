The firm declined to comment on the funding. Katzenberg is chairman of NewTV. \nWhitman, who was reportedly a leading candidate for the chief executive job at ride-hailing firm Uber before it was given to Dara Khosrowshahi, steps down as CEO of Hewlett Packard Enterprise Co ( HPE.N ) on Feb. 1. \nAt HPE, she pulled off one of the biggest corporate breakups in history. She spun off Hewlett Packard Co into HPE and PC-and-printer business HP Inc ( HPQ.N ) in 2015, as part of a plan to turn around the corporation. \nWhitman previously served on the board of DreamWorks Animation, which Katzenberg co-founded.
