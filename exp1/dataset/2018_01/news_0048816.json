Those investors were promised up to 12 percent annual interest if Wanda Commercial failed to relist in Shanghai within two years.\nThe company was delisted in 2016 when Wanda Group took it private with a $4.4 billion fund while planning to relist in Shanghai in the hope of achieving better share price performance.\nWanda Commercial needs to make a $510 million payment on a syndicated loan by the end of March. It has a further $1 billion to repay by the end of May and has $600 million in offshore notes due in November, ratings agencies have said.\nWanda Group said earlier on Monday that it will receive HK$10.32 billion ($1.3 billion) from the disposal of London, Sydney and Gold Coast developments.\nIn a statement on Monday evening, Wanda Group said that, after the introduction of the new strategic investors, Wanda Commercial will be renamed Wanda Commercial Management Group and will aim to complete previously earmarked asset sales in the next one to two years.\n“Going forward, it will stop engaging in property development and will transform into a company solely focused on commercial management,” Wanda Group said.\nLast year Wanda sold a portfolio of domestic hotels and tourism assets, including 13 theme parks, for $9 billion to Sunac and Guangzhou R&F Properties. Wanda Commercial operated 235 Wanda Plazas in China as of the end of last year.\nIn a separate statement, Suning said it will contribute 9.5 billion yuan for a 3.91 percent stake in Wanda Commercial.\n($1 = 6.3300 Chinese yuan renminbi)\nReporting by Clare Jim; Editing by David Goodman\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-29T16:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-29T16:42:41.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
