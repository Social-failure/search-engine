The Shockers won their sixth straight game and extended the nation’s longest road winning streak at 10.\nLandry Shamet also had 11 points and a career-high 11 assists for Wichita State, which shot 59 percent from the field (38-of-64).\nB.J. Tyson led East Carolina (7-9, 1-4) with 16 points while Kentrell Barkley added 14 and Dimitri Spasojevic had 10.\nThe Pirates have dropped four of their last five.\nThe Wichita State lead soared to 54-27 early in the second half when Darral Willis Jr. dropped in a short turnaround jumper.\nEast Carolina had to call timeout when it fell behind 61-29 with 15:30 left in regulation. McDuffie was the lone Wichita State player in double figures with 10 points at that juncture as the Shockers led by a whopping 32 points.\nThe Pirates were essentially defeated in every way possible the rest of the game.\nEast Carolina surprisingly pulled out to an early 14-9 lead. From there, it was all Wichita State, which responded with a 15-0 run to pull back ahead 24-14. McDuffie and Nurger each contributed conventional three-point plays during the spurt.\nThe Shockers continued with a full-court press that led to some easy baskets. Zach Brown stole the ball and dribbled in from midcourt for a dunk and a commanding 39-23 lead with 2:13 remaining in the first half.\nTen different Wichita State players scored in the first half as it rolled to a 45-23 lead heading into the locker room. Amazingly, the Shockers built this huge advantage despite shooting just 4-of-15 from 3-point territory.\nWichita State’s defense was stellar and East Carolina managed to shoot only 9-of-28 in the first half.\n--Field Level Media\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-01-12T12:24:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-12T18:44:11.011+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
