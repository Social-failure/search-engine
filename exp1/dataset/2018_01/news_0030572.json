The bank operates branches in New York, Illinois and California.\nNew York state authorities in 2016 slapped Mega International Commercial Bank with a $180 million fine for violations that included lax attention to risk exposure in Panama, the first time in a decade that a Taiwan-based financial institution had been penalized by U.S. authorities.\nReporting by Michelle Price; Editing by Sandra Maler\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-18T00:54:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-18T01:55:14.001+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
