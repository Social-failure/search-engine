That might have affected valuations,” one of the sources said.\nMemorial Health Group, which opened its first hospital in 2000, operates 10 hospitals and two medical centres across Turkey, according to the company website.\nMedical Park, Turkey’s largest private hospital chain, has priced its initial public offering at up to 28.8 lira a share, it said in a filing, valuing the floatation at up to 1.82 billion lira ($488 million).\n$1 = 3.7786 liras Writing by Ezgi Erkoyun; Editing by Ece Toksabay and Dominic Evans\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-01-29T22:53:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-30T18:57:37.002+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
