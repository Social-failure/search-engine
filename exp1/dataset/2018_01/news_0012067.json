Early works activities at Wahgnion are underway in the lead-up to closing a project debt facility and the commencement of mill construction both anticipated to occur in the second quarter of 2018.\n\"Our operational focus on generating free cash flow at Sabodala is paying off,” said Richard Young, President and Chief Executive Officer. “With record mill throughput and positive reconciliation to ore reserve estimates, Sabodala achieved record gold production for the second consecutive year and exceeded 2017 production guidance. Our five-year profile for Sabodala estimates free cash flow of $230 million between 2018 and 2022, including approximately $90 million in free cash flow over the next two years (1) (2) .”\nAll 2017 numbers are preliminary and unaudited and subject to final adjustment.\n2018 Production Outlook\nThe Company is forecasting gold production at Sabodala of between 210,000 and 225,000 ounces of gold in 2018 (3) . This compares favourably to the 2018 production estimate of 213,000 ounces outlined in the 2017 Sabodala 43-101 technical report filed on August 30, 2017.\nAdded Mr. Young, \"We are excited about 2018. Our expectations are for another year of strong production and cash flow at Sabodala as well as continued organic growth. Our top priority is to close the financing and proceed with construction of Wahgnion. In addition, we are aggressively advancing exploration programs at both Golden Hill in Burkina Faso and Afema in Côte d’Ivoire. With a long-life mine that provides solid annual gold production and free cash flow, a second mine in development and a pipeline of quality organic growth assets, we are well-positioned to deliver on our vision of becoming the next multi-asset mid-tier gold producer in West Africa.”\n2017 Fourth Quarter and Year-End Financial and Operational Results\nTeranga expects to release its financial and operational results for the fourth quarter and year ended December 31, 2017 before markets open on Friday, February 23, 2018. Management will discuss the results during a conference call later that morning at 8:30 a.m. (ET). A webcast of the conference call will be available through Teranga’s website – www.terangagold.com .\nThe conference call can be accessed by dialling (877) 291-4570 (North America toll-free) or (647) 788-4919 (international).

Specific forward-looking statements in this presentation include forecasting gold production of between 210,000 and 225,000 ounces of gold in 2018. Although the forward-looking information contained in this press release reflect management's current beliefs based upon information currently available to management and based upon what management believes to be reasonable assumptions, Teranga cannot be certain that actual results will be consistent with such forward-looking information. Such forward-looking statements are based upon assumptions, opinions and analysis made by management in light of its experience, current conditions and its expectations of future developments that management believe to be reasonable and relevant but that may prove to be incorrect.
