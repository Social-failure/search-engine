An air attack also wrecked a medical centre serving at least 10,000 people in Aleppo governorate on the same day. \n“The loss of the provision of these medical services, including surgical and reproductive health services, will have a staggering effect on vulnerable communities affected by this conflict,” he said in a statement. \nIn 2017, there were 112 verified attacks on health facilities in Syria, and there had been at least 13 so far this year, according to Moumtzis. \nA separate U.N. report said 272,345 people had been displaced between Dec. 15 and Jan. 24 in Idlib governorate, and health organisations there were being stretched to the limit. \nIt described heavy fighting between rebels and Syrian government forces in the eastern part of the governorate, mainly around the town of Abul Thohur and its air base, with numerous civilian casualties and “high levels of psychosocial distress among girls, boys, women and men”. \nSaraqib’s town council has declared a disaster zone and called on the international community to intervene, the U.N. report said.
