Slideshow (2 Images) \nThe 2009 men’s champion Rafa Nadal, who was beaten in a classic five-set final by long-time rival Roger Federer last year, headlines the evening session at Rod Laver Arena with a first round match against Dominican journeyman Victor Estrella Burgos. \nNadal, bidding for a 17th grand slam title, has had very limited preparation since a knee injury forced him to pull out of the season-ending ATP Tour finals but declared himself “more or less” happy with his game on Saturday. \nDanger lurks for a couple of last year’s grand slam champions in the women’s draw, with French Open winner and seventh seed Jelena Ostapenko taking on the seasoned Francesca Schiavone, also a winner at Roland Garros, in the opening match at Rod Laver Arena. \nU.S. Open champion Sloane Stephens, seeded 13th, faces a test against China’s Zhang Shuai in the early match on Margaret Court Arena, the second showcourt. \nFans hoping for a shakeup of the men’s game will keenly watch the progress of third seed Grigor Dimitrov, who plays Austrian qualifier Dennis Novak, on Rod Laver Arena. \nLocal hope Nick Kyrgios, seeded 17th, is certain to generate a raucous atmosphere at his favorite Hisense Arena when he takes on Brazil’s Rogerio Dutra Silva in the late match.
