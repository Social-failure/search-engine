I think success should be rewarded, which it is, but I think everyone has a huge push to make tennis as attractive as possible. \n“Now if you are top 100 you are making a good living. I think we want to push that to the (top) 150, 200,” added Anderson, who was beaten in the first round on Monday. \nPrize money in the slams has increased drastically in recent years. \nWimbledon’s total prize money has nearly doubled in the last five years, rising from 16.06 million pounds to 31.6 million pounds ($43.59 million) in 2017, although the percentage rises have been greatest for early-round losers. \nThe Australian Open prize money increased by 10 percent this year to A$55 million ($43.82 million) with the winners of the men’s and women’s singles titles pocketing A$4 million. \nPrize money on the ATP Tour, which is owned jointly by the tournaments and the players, has risen by 113 percent in the last 10 years.
