(Nasdaq:USAP) today reported net sales for the fourth quarter of 2017 of $50.3 million, an increase of 47.2% from $34.2 million in the fourth quarter of 2016, and slightly below $50.9 million in the 2017 third quarter. All end markets made substantial contributions to the year-over-year quarterly sales growth, including aerospace, the Company's largest end market, where sales grew 70.1% from the fourth quarter of 2016.\nSales of premium alloys remained at record levels in the fourth quarter of 2017 at $7.3 million, or 14.6% of sales, compared with $7.4 million, or 14.5% of sales reached in the third quarter of 2017, and versus $3.1 million, or 9.1% of sales, in the fourth quarter of 2016.\nFor full year 2017, sales increased to $202.6 million, up 31.2% from $154.4 million in 2016. Sales of premium alloys in 2017 increased 90.1% to $27.3 million, or 13.5% of sales, from $14.4 million, or 9.3% of sales, in 2016.\nThe Company’s gross margin for the fourth quarter of 2017 was $6.2 million, or 12.3% of sales, compared with $5.5 million, or 10.7% of sales, in the third quarter of 2017, and $3.1 million, or 9.1% of sales, in the fourth quarter of 2016.\nFor the fourth quarter of 2017, selling, general and administrative expenses were $5.1 million, or 10.2% of sales, compared with $4.4 million, or 8.7% of sales, in the 2017 third quarter, and $4.5 million, or 13.3% of sales, in the fourth quarter of 2016. The fourth quarter increase is primarily due to increased legal expenses and adjustments to the bonus program accruals.\nNet income for the fourth quarter of 2017 was $7.9 million, or $1.06 per diluted share, including a net tax benefit of $1.06 per diluted share primarily attributable to the new federal tax legislation. In the third quarter of 2017, the Company incurred a net loss of $0.3 million, or $0.04 per diluted share, including unusual charges related to the facility fires totaling $0.03 per diluted share, and $0.03 per diluted share of discrete tax expense items mainly related to the new stock compensation accounting guidance in 2017. In the fourth quarter of 2016, the Company's net loss was $1.6 million, or $0.22 per diluted share.\nFor full year 2017, net income was $7.6 million, or $1.03 per diluted share, (including $1.03 per diluted share of net tax benefit) compared with a net loss of $5.3 million, or $0.74 per diluted share, in full year 2016.\nThe Company’s EBITDA for the fourth quarter of 2017 was $5.8 million, an increase of 2.3% from the 2017 third quarter and an increase of 82.4% from the prior year fourth quarter.\nFor full year 2017, the Company’s EBITDA was $22.9 million, an increase of $9.5 million, or 71.6%, compared with full year 2016.\nBacklog (before surcharges) at December 31, 2017 was $77.7 million, an increase of 17.3% from September 30, 2017, and 77.3% higher than at the end of the 2016 fourth quarter. The December 31, 2017 backlog is the largest backlog since the second quarter of 2012.\nThe Company’s fourth quarter debt was $79.7 million compared with $77.1 in the third quarter of 2017, with the increase for higher working capital driven by strong bookings and backlog growth.\nCapital expenditures for the fourth quarter of 2017 increased to $3.3 million from $1.6 million in the third quarter of 2017 and $1.3 million in the fourth quarter of 2016 and included down payments on capital projects scheduled for 2018 in Dunkirk and Bridgeville.\nChairman, President and CEO Dennis Oates commented: “We continue to see positive customer sentiment and increasing market momentum. Our bookings in the fourth quarter were the highest level reached since the first quarter of 2012. Our top line continued to grow, including a record level of premium alloy sales, despite the normal seasonal slow-down as customers address their year-end inventory targets and extreme weather conditions.\n“We made modest progress in improving our gross margin during the fourth quarter, although there was some spill-over effect from the September fire-related issues as we sold through third quarter production and worked to keep orders flowing according to schedule. These challenges are now largely behind us and our focus is on expanding gross margins, driving efficiencies and seizing opportunities in the current strong market.”\nWebcast\nThe Company has scheduled a conference call for today, January 24, 2018, at 10:00 a.m. (Eastern) to discuss fourth quarter 2017 results.

Forward-looking statements involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties that may cause the Company's actual results in future periods to differ materially from forecasted results. Those risks include, among others, the concentrated nature of the Company’s customer base to date and the Company’s dependence on its significant customers; the receipt, pricing and timing of future customer orders; changes in product mix; the limited number of raw material and energy suppliers and significant fluctuations that may occur in raw material and energy prices; risks related to property, plant and equipment, including the Company’s reliance on the continuing operation of critical manufacturing equipment; risks associated with labor matters; the Company’s ongoing requirement for continued compliance with laws and regulations, including applicable safety and environmental regulations; the ultimate outcome of the Company’s current and future litigation and matters; risks related to acquisitions that the Company may make; and the impact of various economic, credit and market risk uncertainties. Many of these factors are not within the Company’s control and involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties that may cause the Company’s actual results in future periods to be materially different from any future performance suggested herein. Any unfavorable change in the foregoing or other factors could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business, financial condition and results of operations. Further, the Company operates in an industry sector where securities values may be volatile and may be influenced by economic and other factors beyond the Company’s control. Certain of these risks and other risks are described in the Company's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) over the last 12 months, copies of which are available from the SEC or may be obtained upon request from the Company .\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nThis press release includes discussions of financial measures that have not been determined in accordance with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP). These measures include earnings (loss) before interest, income taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) and Adjusted EBITDA. We include these measurements to enhance the understanding of our operating performance. We believe that EBITDA, considered along with net earnings (loss), is a relevant indicator of trends relating to cash generating activity of our operations. Adjusted EBITDA excludes the effect of share-based compensation expense and other non-cash generating activity such as impairments and the write-off of deferred financing costs. We believe excluding these costs provides a consistent comparison of the cash generating activity of our operations. We believe that EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are useful to investors as they facilitate a comparison of our operating performance to other companies who also use EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA as supplemental operating measures. These non-GAAP financial measures supplement our GAAP disclosures and should not be considered an alternative to the GAAP measures. These non-GAAP measures may not be entirely comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies due to potential differences among calculations methodologies. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to their most directly comparable financial measure prepared in accordance with GAAP is included in the tables that follow.\nCONTACTS:\nDennis M.
