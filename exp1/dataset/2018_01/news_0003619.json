REUTERS/Rick Wilking/File Photo Buffett maintained that most American children will live “far better” than their parents did, but urged the country to focus on closing the gap between the rich and less-rich.\nWhile the wealth of the 400 richest Americans rose to $2.7 trillion last year from $93 billion in 1982, as computed by Forbes magazine Buffett said millions of people were left behind, “stuck on an economic treadmill.”\nHe said this can be fixed.\n“A rich family takes care of all its children, not just those with talents valued by the marketplace,” Buffett wrote.\n“In the years of growth that certainly lie ahead, I have no doubt that America can both deliver riches to many and a decent life to all. We must not settle for less.”\nBuffett ranked third on Forbes’ list on Thursday with an $85.8 billion fortune, trailing only Amazon.com Inc’s ( AMZN.O ) Jeff Bezos and Gates.\nHe might have ranked higher had he not donated roughly $27.6 billion of Berkshire stock to charity since 2006, including $30 million to an unnamed charity on Wednesday.\nReporting by Jonathan Stempel in New York; Editing by David Gregorio\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-04T18:54:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-04T19:13:22.008+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
