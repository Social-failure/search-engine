I had a shot and we found out it had helped but I would need the shot to go closer to the nerve. Then it should be completely fine. \n“Fortunately it has improved already.” \nShe has since improved enough to return to action at the ISU World Cup event in Erfurt at the weekend where she raced in the 1,500m and 3,000m, but said beforehand she was still suffering pain. \n”I didn’t know something could hurt like this,“ she said. ”The pain is sometimes really unbelievable. \n”One moment it is good, one moment not so much. I was just in Italy for three weeks where I trained for everything I should. \n”Sometimes I went through the pain, but sometimes I almost didn’t feel the pain. It depends.

The pain is sometimes really, really unbelievable. It’s a pain that I have to get through. \n“When I go at a sharp tempo, then it is really hard to fight it, but so far it can be done.” \nThe 30-year-old from Nove Mesto Na Morave has won three Olympic gold medals, has held the world record in the 5,000m since 2011 and her rivalry with Dutchwoman Ireen Wust is one of the sport’s most intense. \nWust beat Sablikova to gold in the 3,000 at the Sochi Games four years ago, but the Czech came back strong to win the 5,000 and defend the crown she had claimed for the first time at the Vancouver Games in 2010. \nIn Korea, Sablikova will focus on the 1,000m and 3,000m, although her coach Petr Novak has not ruled her out of taking part in the 1,500m as well. \n“Martina had something blocked in her back, which has loosened, but some small problems have remained. As if you catch a cramp and it holds on you for a month and does not want to relax completely,” he said. \n“We are working on Martina’s back to be at least 99 percent fine at the Games. I stay calm. Even in her current condition she would fight for medals in Kora.” \nNovak added that Nikola Zdrahalova, in the mass start, and Karolina Erbanova in the women’s 500m were both also medal contenders. \n“I believe Martina and Karolina will be fighting for medal positions,” Novak said. \n“Martina on both her distances and Karolina mainly in 500m. In the group race Nikola may be in the game too.” Additional reporting by Jan Lopatka and Jason Hovet in Prague; Editing by Greg Stutchbury", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-22T15:14:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-22T15:31:03.001+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
