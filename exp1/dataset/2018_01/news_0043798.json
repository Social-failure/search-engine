It’s been a good run, but we can’t risk lives over having clean clothes. \nIt followed the circulation of a series of videos of teenagers consuming the brightly coloured detergent sachets and then daring others to do the same “Tide Pod challenge”. \n“We are not discontinuing Tide Pods,” the company said in an emailed statement. “They are used safely by millions of people around the world and we will continue to offer them, in addition to other detergent forms from Tide.” \nOn Tuesday, the company had said it was doing all it could to stop the challenge.
