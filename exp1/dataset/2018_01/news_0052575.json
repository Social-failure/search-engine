The opening had been delayed for a year following injuries O‘Brien suffered on the set. \nThe original “Maze Runner” launched with $32.5 million in 2014 and “Maze Runner: The Scorch Trials” launched with $30.6 million in 2015. “The Death Cure” generated a B+ Cinemascore and drew a 51 percent female audience; 57 percent of the total audience was under 25. \n“Jumanji” finished with $16.4 million at 3,553 sites in its sixth weekend, declining only 16 percent and giving it $338 million domestically since Dec. 20 -- $3 million behind “Zootopia” for the 46th spot on the all-time list. That’s far above anyone’s original forecast and makes it the third-highest performer for Sony of all time. \nThe action comedy, starring Dwayne Johnson and Kevin Hart, also grossed $17.7 million internationally this weekend for an overseas total of $484 million and a worldwide box office of $821.7 million. \nOverall domestic business was solid rather than spectacular with $139 million, down 2.5 percent from the same weekend last year, according to comScore. Thanks largely to “Jumanji,” year-to-date business as of Sunday is up 1.7 percent to $918.9 million. \nChristian Bale’s “Hostiles” led the rest of the pack with $10.2 million at 2,815 venues as Entertainment Studios expanded the historical drama from 119 locations. Fox’s sixth weekend of “The Greatest Showman” came in fourth with $8.9 million at 2,663 screens, declining only 11 percent in a remarkable show of staying power. The Hugh Jackman musical has taken in $126.5, which has proven a solid draw for Fox and should finish the weekend with roughly $126 million. \nSteven Spielberg’s “The Post” followed in fifth with $8.9 million at 2,640 locations in the wake of Oscar nominations for best picture and Meryl Streep as best actress. The Fox release declined only 24 percent and has topped $58 million so far. \nWarner’s second weekend of “12 Strong” finished sixth with $8.6 million at 3,018 sites, edging STXfilms’ second frame of “Den of Thieves” with $8.4 million at 2,432 venues. \nFox Searchlight’s “The Shape of Water,” which led the Oscar nominations with 13, came in eighth with $5.7 million at 1,840 sites as the studio added 1,001 new locations. The fantasy drama has grossed $37.7 million in nine weeks. \nWarner Bros.’ third weekend of “Paddington 2” took ninth with $5.6 million at 2,792 screens. Disney-Lucasfilm’s seventh weekend of “Star Wars: The Last Jedi” followed in 10th place with $4.2 million at 1,745 venues for a 45-day total of $610.7 million. \nFox Searchlight’s “Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri” finished 11th with $3.6 million at 1,457 sites in the wake of receiving seven Oscar nominations, lifting its three-month total to $37 million. \nFocus Features’“Darkest Hour,” which scored six Oscar nominations, pulled in $2.9 million at 1,322 locations, lifting the Winston Churchill war drama past $45 million. Focus’“Phantom Thread,” which also received six Oscar nods, took in $2.9 million at 1,021 sites to push domestic gross to $10.6 million for the Daniel Day-Lewis fashion drama.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-28T19:42:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-28T20:17:22.005+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
