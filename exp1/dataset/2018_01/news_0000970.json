It was projected to raise roughly $30 billion over a decade. \nAfter drawing harsh criticism from both political parties as well as medical industry lobbying groups, the U.S. Congress approved a suspension of the levy in 2015. \nThe suspension expired on New Year’s Day after unsuccessful last-ditch efforts by Republicans. \nRepublicans would have automatically killed the tax if they had succeeded in repealing Obamacare last year. The levy remained in Republican-crafted tax legislation signed by President Donald Trump on Dec. 22. \nSupporters of the tax say it has helped provide health insurance to millions of previously uninsured Americans. \nCritics, who have vowed to keep fighting the levy, say it has stifled the medical industry and slashed jobs. \n“The tax has had a significant negative impact on medical innovation and has resulted in the loss or deferred creation of jobs,” the Advanced Medical Technology Association lobbying group said on its website.
