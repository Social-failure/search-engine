In this role, Mr. Huang will oversee CIFC’s structured products investments business. This appointment is a key strategic move that will further bolster the firm’s investment expertise and market presence in the structured products space. Previously, Mr. Huang served as Managing Director and Global Head of CLO, CDO and Distressed SIV Trading for Citigroup Global Markets, Inc., a business he built to become the top revenue-generating business within the firm’s Structured Credit Division. Mr. Huang will be based in New York and will report to CIFC’s Co-CEOs Oliver Wriedt and Steve Vaccaro.\n“Jay is a highly respected, career-long structured credit investor with a track record of exceptional performance through all market cycles,” said Oliver Wriedt, Co-CEO of CIFC. “His significant structured credit expertise, combined with his experience in applying data science concepts and creating cutting-edge trading technology, will add tremendous value to CIFC’s investment capabilities as we continue to scale and strengthen our product offerings for our global clients.”\n“I am excited to join CIFC, a renowned investor in structured products,” added Mr. Huang. “With a deep bench of seasoned credit professionals and a robust credit analytics infrastructure, CIFC has a powerful platform for LP investors to capitalize on the inefficiencies of the structured products market while simultaneously benefitting from the expertise of a top-tier credit manager. The successes of 2017, a landmark year for CIFC in CLO issuance, are the direct results of the firm’s deep capital markets network and its dedication to structured products, both of which will be instrumental in the further expansion of CIFC’s structured credit investments business.”\nMr. Huang has more than fifteen years of experience trading structured products and building market-leading teams at Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.

Under his leadership as Global Head of Trading, Greenwich Survey and Coalition, the bellwether surveys in the securities market, frequently ranked his CLO and CDO businesses #1 across many major categories, including profitability and market presence.
