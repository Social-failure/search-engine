Neither were “considered material in the context of the group”, it said. \nHowever the company, which said it would continue to cooperate with authorities, said it was too early to predict the outcome of the investigation. \nShares in Chemring, which earlier posted full-year results, fell as low as 167.2 pence before recovering to trade 3.2 percent higher at 183p by 1130 GMT.
