(NYSE:BCRH) (the \"Company\"), a Bermuda holding company that, through its operating subsidiaries, offers collateralized reinsurance in the property catastrophe market and invests in various insurance-linked securities, today reported its financial results for the fourth quarter of 2017.\nThe Company recorded break-even results of $0.0 million ($0.00 per share) for the fourth quarter of 2017 and a net loss of $43.2 million ($4.94 per share) for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017. The Company’s fully converted book value per common share was $14.48 at December 31, 2017, reflecting no change during the current quarter and a 23.6% decrease over the past twelve months, each inclusive of dividends declared in such periods.\nReinsurance premiums written for the current quarter were $6.7 million decreasing by $2.0 million over the same period a year ago while reinsurance premiums written for the full year 2017 were $46.1 million, increasing by $2.9 million over the comparable period. The decrease in the current quarter's reinsurance premium was predominantly driven by the timing of premium recognition.\nThe combined ratios for the current quarter and year-to-date were 102.3% and 201.3% compared to 61.1% and 65.0% in the same periods a year ago. The increase in the current periods' combined ratios was due to significantly higher loss and loss adjustment expense ratios. The current quarter's loss and loss adjustment expenses of $7.3 million reflected fourth quarter losses related to the California wildfires and additional estimated losses related to the third quarter hurricanes. Reinsurance acquisition costs for the current quarter were $1.9 million compared to $2.4 million a year ago, reflecting lower profit commissions driven by the reduced profitability. General and administrative expenses for the current quarter of $0.9 million were modestly lower than a year ago due to lower management and performance fees.\nMichael J. McGuire, Chairman and CEO, commented: \"Our 2017 results were driven by the significant catastrophe losses which included a record setting three Category 4 hurricanes hitting the United States, earthquakes in Mexico and wildfires in California. Collectively, the 2017 events are estimated to have generated insurance industry losses in excess of $100 billion. Our portfolio performed in line with our modeled expectations and our teams are fully engaged in efficiently settling claims for our customers. Looking forward, pricing improvements are expected through 2018, particularly in loss affected areas. At January1 st renewals, pricing reflected the impact of these events as our renewing business experienced an overall price increase of 12% -- a reversal of pricing declines experienced in recent years. We remain well positioned to participate in the improving market for the benefit of our shareholders.\"\nAbout the Company\nBlue Capital Reinsurance Holdings Ltd., through its operating subsidiaries, offers collateralized reinsurance in the property catastrophe market, leveraging underwriting expertise and infrastructure from established resources.

The last major treaty renewal date was January 1, 2018. Our January 1, 2018 estimated net exposures by zone were in compliance with our underwriting guidelines. Namely, our estimated net exposure from any one catastrophe loss event in any individual zone was at or below 50% of our then-projected December 31, 2017 shareholders’ equity. These broadly defined major catastrophe zones are defined as follows:\nNorth America : Europe : Rest of World: U.S. - Northeast Western Central Europe (1) Australia U.S. - Mid-Atlantic Eastern Europe New Zealand U.S. - Florida Southern Europe Japan U.S. - Gulf Northern Europe, Benelux South America U.S. - New Madrid and Scandinavia Middle East U.S. - Midwest U.K. and Ireland U.S. - California U.S. - Hawaii Canada - Eastern Canada - Western (1) Consisting of France, Germany, Switzerland and Austria. Single Event Losses\nFor certain defined natural catastrophe region and peril combinations, the Manager assesses the probability and likely magnitude of losses using a combination of industry third-party models, proprietary models and underwriting judgment. The Manager attempts to model the estimated net impact from a single event, taking into account contributions from property catastrophe reinsurance (including retrocessional business), property pro-rata reinsurance and event-linked derivative securities, offset by the net benefit of any reinsurance or derivative protections we purchase and the benefit of premiums.\nOn January 1, 2018 our estimated single event loss exposures were within our underwriting guidelines. Namely, the estimated net impact from any one catastrophe loss event (excluding earthquake) at the 1 in 100 year return period for any one zone did not exceed 35% of our then-projected December 31, 2017 shareholders’ equity, and the estimated net impact from any one earthquake loss event at the 1 in 250 year return period for any zone did not exceed 35% of our then-projected December 31, 2017 shareholders’ equity.\nUpdated Single Event Loss Projections\nThe table that follows details our estimated net impact from single event losses as of January 1, 2018 for selected zones at specified return periods using industry-recognized third-party vendor models. The values noted take into account the impact of the 2017 loss events on our limits reinsured and shareholders' equity. It is important to note that each catastrophe model we use contains its own assumptions as to the frequency and severity of loss events, and results may vary significantly from model to model.\nNet Impact From Single Event Losses at Specified Return Periods\nNet Impact\n(Millions) Return Period (1) Percentage of December 31, 2017\nShareholders’ Equity U.S. - Florida hurricane $ 34 1 in 100 year 27% U.S. - California earthquake 24 1 in 250 year 19% Japan earthquake 20 1 in 250 year 16% U.S. - Gulf hurricane 19\n1 in 100 year 15% All other zones less than 15% (1) A \"100-year\" return period can also be referred to as the 1.0% occurrence exceedance probability (\"OEP\"), meaning there is an estimated 1.0% chance in any given year that this level will be exceeded. A \"250-year\" return period can also be referred to as the 0.4% OEP, meaning there is an estimated 0.4% chance in any given year that this level will be exceeded.\nOur single event loss estimates represent snapshots as of the time of such estimates. The composition of our in-force portfolio may change materially at any time due to the acceptance of new policies, losses incurred, the expiration of existing policies and changes in our ceded reinsurance and derivative protections.\nSource:Blue Capital Reinsurance Holdings", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-31T00:15:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-31T02:49:11.003+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
