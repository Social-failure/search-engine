Swiss drugmaker Novartis' logo is seen at the company's plant in the northern Swiss town of Stein, Switzerland October 23, 2017. REUTERS/Arnd Wiegmann \nThe drug has received the designation for use in combination with standard immunosuppressive therapy in treating the rare blood disorder in which a patientâ€™s bone marrow fails to produce enough red blood cells, white blood cells and platelets, the Swiss drug maker said on Thursday. \nPromacta is already approved as a second-line therapy in SAA, as well as for adults and children with chronic immune thrombocytopenia. \nBreakthrough status is a designation given to treatments demonstrating substantial improvement over existing therapies in treating a serious or life threatening illness. \nNovartis said it expects regulatory filings in both the United States and the European Union this year.
