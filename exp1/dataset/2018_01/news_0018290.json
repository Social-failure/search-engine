Privately owned Lactalis, one of the world’s biggest dairies, exports its baby food products to 83 countries across Europe, Africa and Asia.\nThe recall involves up to 12 million tins of baby milk.\n“It’s not easy to evaluate the number of items that need to be returned because we don’t know what’s been consumer already,” he said.\nFriday’s recall was the third in a month and Lactalis has come under fire for its botched response. Besnier also told the French weekly that the company had acted as quickly and efficiently as possible and denied slowing the process to curb losses.\nBesnier has also been criticised for failing to speak out publicly during the salmonella scare.\nWhile his family are France’s 11th wealthiest, according to a 2017 ranking by Challenges magazine, the dairy tycoon has long shunned the public limelight and schmoozing with politicians.\nHis workers nickname him the “invisible man.”\n“We’re a discreet business. In this region there is a mentality of ‘work first, speak later,” he said. But he acknowledged lessons had been learned during the past few weeks.\nLactalis has become an industry giant, with annual sales of 17 billion euros ($20.73 billion) and 18,900 employees across some 40 countries.\nHe said the Craon plant was likely to remain closed for several months.\nThe recall risks damaging Lactalis in China, a fast-growing market for baby food and dairy products where scares after melamine-tainted baby milk led to the deaths of six children in 2008.\nThat scandal caused distrust in locally produced infant formula and benefited foreign suppliers such as Nestle, Danone and Lactalis.
