REUTERS/Alvin Baez Wildfires caused $14 billion of insurance losses in 2017 – the highest on record for the peril, Aon said.\nCalifornia faced wildfires in the northern part of the state that resulted in losses to those insured of more than $9 billion in October. Later in December, a sprawling Southern California wildfire become the largest on record in the state.\nOther notable weather events in the year included earthquakes in Mexico, floods and Typhoon Hato in China and drought in Southern Europe.\n“The insurance industry was well-positioned to handle the cost of the 2017 disasters. Global reinsurer capital was a record $600 billion at the end of third quarter 2017,” Aon said.\nAs a result, some reinsurers had been expecting double-digit price rises across the board when the Jan. 1 renewals came around after all of last year’s losses.\nIn the end, however, global property reinsurance prices rose less than expected, with strong competition limiting increases to single-digit percentages.\nGerman reinsurer Munich Re, said this month that insurers will have to pay claims of around $135 billion for 2017, the most ever, following the spate of hurricanes, earthquakes and fires in North America.\nReporting by Noor Zainab Hussain in Bengaluru; Additional reporting by Carolyn Cohn in London; Editing by Hugh Lawson\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-24T16:36:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-24T16:53:38.018+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
