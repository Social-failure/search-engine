It will be distributed to that state’s Victims Compensation Fund and Department of Health and Human Services. \n“For many years Rite Aid has had in place robust and extensive internal controls designed to ensure full compliance with the Combat Methamphetamine Epidemic Act,” a law from 2005, Rite Aid said in a statement. “Rite Aid is fully committed to its ongoing partnership with law enforcement and government in combating drug abuse.” \nThe Camp Hill, Pennsylvania-based company is in the process of selling 1,932 stores to larger rival Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc, after the chains were unable last year to win approval from antitrust regulators to merge.
