That alone would have wiped out the dividend GE Capital was to have paid GE in the second-half of 2017.\nFlannery late last year outlined steps to turn the biggest U.S. industrial conglomerate into a smaller, more focused company.\nGE, the worst performer on the Dow in 2017, has already cut its planned annual dividend for 2018 to 48 cents from 96 cents a year earlier, only the third cut in the company's 125-year history.\nThe company said the Kansas Insurance Department, NALH's primary regulator, had approved a phased statutory contribution of about $3 billion in the current quarter and about $2 billion annually from 2019 through 2024.\nUp to Friday's close, GE's stock had fallen 40.2 percent in the past 12 months, compared with a 29.8 percent increase in the Dow Jones Industrial Average.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-16T13:39:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-16T13:46:10.002+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
