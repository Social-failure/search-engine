The report did not specify a date, but appeared to mean the incidents happened on Monday.\n“Bahraini radars have tracked the Qatari military planes while intercepting the Emirati civilian aircraft,” WAM Quote: d civil aviation director Saif al-Suwaidi as saying.\n“The incident could also be seen by the naked eye by both the crew and passengers, which constitutes a clear threat to the lives of innocent civilians,” he added.\nThe UAE condemned the Qatari action as “a serious and renewed breach of international conventions and the safety of civil aircraft traffic”.\nThe UAE Civil Aviation Authority did not say which airlines were involved, but Bahrain’s state news agency BNA said the first flight was from Emirates [EMIRA.UL]. The airline is owned by the government of Dubai, one of seven emirates in the UAE federation. It gave no details of the second flight.\nQatar’s foreign ministry said the UAE allegation followed incidents on Dec. 21 and Jan. 3 in which UAE military aircraft had violated its airspace.\nMinistry spokeswoman Lulwa Rashed al-Khater said Qatar planned to take legal action against the UAE over the incidents.\n“It seems that the Civil Aviation Authority in the UAE, by publishing false claims, is trying to pre-empt events and cover over news of the Emirati plane penetration of Qatari airspace,” Khater said in the statement, posted on the ministry’s website.\nOn Friday, Qatar said it had filed a complaint with the United Nations about the alleged violation of its airspace on Dec. 21. The UAE denied the allegation.\nReporting by Noah Browning, Aziz el Yaakoubi, Mohamed el Sherif and Mostafa Hashem; editing by Andrew Roche\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-15T11:56:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-15T12:07:04.031+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
