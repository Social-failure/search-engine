The report did not say where that happened. \n“Clarifying the ultimate results of the deciphering process takes time and it could take months,” Haqshenas said, according to ISNA. \nThe Sanchi, run by Iran’s top oil shipping operator, collided with the CF Crystal about 160 nautical miles off the coast of China near Shanghai and the mouth of the Yangtze River Delta on Jan. 6. \nThe Panama-registered tanker was sailing from Iran to South Korea, carrying 136,000 tonnes of condensate, an ultra light crude, equivalent to just under 1 million barrels, worth about $60 million. \nThe Sanchi sank on Jan. 14 after burning for several days. The entire crew of 30 Iranians and two Bangladeshis, are presumed dead.
