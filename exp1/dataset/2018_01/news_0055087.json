The Fighting Illini followed up Wednesday’s 73-71 win over Indiana by shooting a season-best 56.9 percent.\nNichols and Frazier were a combined 13 of 21 from the floor.

The Illini took a five-point lead on a 3-pointer by Alstork on their next possession and didn’t score for another 4:38 when a layup by Te‘Jon Lucas sparked a 13-0 run.\nAfter Rutgers broke a scoring drought of nearly three minutes, Frazier hit consecutive 3-pointers for a 32-14 lead with 5:56 left and Illinois carried a 41-22 lead into halftime.\nIllinois took its first 30-point lead less than five minutes into the second half on a jumper by Black.
