The Vatican has not said why.\nHis avoidance of Argentina is unusual: John Paul II frequented Poland, and Benedict XVI started his papacy in his native Germany.\nResidents of Peru’s Buenos Aires hope the visit from the pope will spur local authorities to speed up reconstruction work in the area.\nReporting by Reuters TV, additional reporting by Marco Aquino in Lima; Writing by Caroline Stauffer; Editing by Lisa Von Ahn\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-01-21T02:34:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-21T03:28:38.001+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
