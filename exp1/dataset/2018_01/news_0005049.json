That prompted 2,000 lawyers to march in protest against what they said was the most blatant interference in the city’s judicial independence.\nIncoming Justice Secretary Teresa Cheng, 59, said her “prime mission” would be to uphold the rule of law and that she would pursue criminal prosecutions “without any interference”.\nReporting by Venus Wu and Wyman Ma; Editing by James Pomfret, Greg Torode and Nick Macfie\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-05T07:53:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-05T08:11:16.001+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
