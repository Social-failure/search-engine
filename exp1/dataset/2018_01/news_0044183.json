It has not yet released the figure for 2017.\nFDJ is 72 percent state-owned and sources have said it is likely to be among the first companies to kick off a wave of French privatisations.\nBNP Paribas bank and law firm Weil, Gotshal & Manges LLP, mandated by France’s state holding company APE to prepare the privatisation of FDJ, will hand in a report on the operation by mid-February, two sources familiar with the situation told Reuters.\n“It is clear that the state is the shareholder and will thus decide on the matter. We are expecting the state to take decisions within its own timetable,” Pallez added.\nThe French finance ministry has announced plans to sell 10 billion euros ($12.48 billion) worth of stakes in state-owned companies to raise money for a new fund to finance innovation, an election pledge of President Emmanuel Macron.
