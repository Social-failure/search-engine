Participants were not identified. \nThe winner of the Hollandse Kust Zuid auction will be announced in mid-March. The auction is the third in a series of five Dutch tenders to build offshore wind farms with a total capacity of 3,500 MW by 2022. \nSo far, only Swedish energy company Vattenfall and Norway’s Statoil have publicly disclosed their participation in Hollandse Kust Zuid auction.
