The companies were unable to garner the approval of the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, which reviews acquisitions by foreign entities for possible national security risks. \nIBM – IBM was upgraded to \"outperform\" from \"sector perform\" at RBC Capital Markets, which also raised its price target on the stock to $180 from $160. RBC sees both cyclical and secular drivers that could improve IBM's performance, among them: a new cycle of mainframe purchases, as well as currency tailwinds that haven't been seen for a number of years. \nAmerican Express – Deutsche Bank began coverage on the financial services giant with a \"buy\" rating, noting benefits from tax reform and a cutback in federal regulation. The bank cites similar reasons in issuing a \"buy\" rating on Discover Financial Services . \nAlexion Pharmaceuticals – Alexion will work with activist investor Elliott Management on filling a board seat. Elliott has built a stake in the drugmaker and has been pushing for changes. \nAmerican Airlines Group , Southwest Airlines – The airlines both announced that they would give employees a $1,000 bonus due to the new tax law and a lower corporate tax rate. Southwest also announced an increased fleet investment with jetmaker Boeing , as well as a $5 million charitable donation. \nValeant Pharmaceuticals – Valeant and investor Bill Ackman have been asked to appear in court January 16 to discuss a proposed settlement in an insider trading lawsuit involving trading in Allergan shares. The court said it has questions about whether a proposed $290 settlement is reasonable and fair. \nApartment Investment & Management Co. – The apartment REIT had its lawsuit against Airbnb dismissed by a U.S. district court. Aimco had claimed that Airbnb – which specializes in short-term rentals – allowed tenants to break leases through unauthorized sublets. \nNovartis – The drugmaker received a \"breakthrough therapy\" designation for its breast cancer treatment Kisqali. The designation grants priority review to drugs with promising results in clinical trials. \nCharter Communications – Guggenheim upgraded the cable operator to \"buy\" from \"neutral,\" saying Charter not only has an attractive customer footprint but also will benefit from tax perform and lighter regulation. \nGeneral Mills – Piper Jaffray upgraded the food company's stock to \"neutral\" from \"underweight,\" pointing to higher quality brand launches and benefits from corporate tax reform. \nOracle – Morgan Stanley upgraded the stock to \"overweight\" from \"equal-weight,\" saying the stock is undervalued after some disappointing cloud-related results in recent quarters.
