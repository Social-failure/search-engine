There have been isolated incidents in Afghanistan in which the fighters of both appear to have cooperated. \nThere are currently about 14,000 U.S. troops in Afghanistan and under President Donald Trump’s South Asia strategy, U.S. troops are allowed to accompany Afghan forces at the battalion level, potentially putting them at greater risk. \nReporting by Idrees Ali; Editing by Chizu Nomiyama and Tom Brown\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-02T18:37:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-02T18:50:30.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
