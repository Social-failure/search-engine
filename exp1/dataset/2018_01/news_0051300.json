There was no immediate claim of responsibility for the attack. \n“The provisional toll is 14 dead, 17 wounded and two enemies killed. The search is still on for those missing,” one of the sources said. \nThe second source said “around 15” soldiers had been killed. \n“The soldiers abandoned their position. The enemy carried away material,” he said. \nBoth sources asked not to be named as they were not authorized to speak to the media. \nIslamist fighters seized control of Mali’s northern desert regions in 2012 before being driven back by a French-led intervention a year later. \nBut despite the presence of a U.N. peacekeeping mission and troops operating under a regional French anti-militant mission, violence is again on the rise and attacks are spreading further south toward the capital, Bamako. \n“These barbaric attacks will not scare us. On the contrary, they reinforce our determination to fight against the terrorists,” President Keita said, speaking in the central Mali village of Boni where 26 people were killed on Thursday. \nThose victims were traveling from neighboring Burkina Faso in a civilian passenger vehicle when it struck a landmine. \nIn a separate incident on the same day in the nearby town of Youwarou, the Malian military said its forces repelled an attack by suspected Islamist fighters. \nMali and its western neighbor Senegal plan to deploy 1,000 troops soon in an operation to pacify central Mali and contain jihadists who had previously been confined to its Saharan expanses in the north. \nBut analysts doubt they will be able to do so purely through military means. The Islamists exploit the grievances of Fulani cattle herders and their disputes with local farmers over access to grazing lands. \nThe government’s periodic crackdowns on suspected jihadists have therefore tended to target the Fulani, driving some of them into the arms of the armed groups.
