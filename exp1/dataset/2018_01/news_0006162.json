Luftverkehrs KG,” the statement said. \nAlso, passengers who booked tickets for Niki flights entered a contract with the parent, Air Berlin, it said. \nThe higher court, Berlin’s regional court, will rule on the matter shortly, the statement said, without being more specific. \nIAG declined to comment on the matter. \nReporting by Maria Sheahan; Additional reporting by Alistair Smout; Editing by Christoph Steitz and Mark Potter\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-04T13:25:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-04T13:38:08.031+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
