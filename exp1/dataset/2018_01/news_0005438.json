Smart cars are a key part of the project.\nThe NDRC said it wanted to build a national team with officials from the State Council to guide smart car innovation and planned to encourage the launch of preferential policies for related businesses which could include tax cuts.\nThe NDRC also said it hoped that China would gain a global reputation for quality smart cars by 2035.\nReporting by SHANGHAI Newsroom and Brenda Goh; Editing by Gopakumar Warrier\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-01-05T18:08:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-05T22:31:09.025+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
