However, it faces growing competition from monitoring apps that work directly on smartphones and other personal devices.\nThe company reported revenue of $3.21 billion for the nine months ended Sept. 30, up 69 percent from the same period a year earlier.\nMore than 90 percent of ADT's revenue comes from recurring monthly payments under customer contract terms that are generally three to five years in length, the company said in its IPO filing.\nMorgan Stanley, Goldman Sachs, Barclays, Deutsche Bank Securities and RBC Capital Markets were among top underwriters to the offering.
