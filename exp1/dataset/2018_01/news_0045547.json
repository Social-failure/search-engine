Baird in Milwaukee.\n“But I would lean towards the fact that the market has come so far so fast. If we continue to hit lower today, I think then we have come to a buying exhaustion point.”\nBy 11:56 a.m. ET (1656 GMt), the Dow Jones industrial average was up just 65 points, or 0.25 percent, at 26,275.91, having earlier risen around 0.7 percent on the day.\nThe S&P 500 was down 0.27 points, or 0.00951 percent, at 2,838.86 and the Nasdaq Composite lost 34.16 points, or 0.46 percent, at 7,426.13.
