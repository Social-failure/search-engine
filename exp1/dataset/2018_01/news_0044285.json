He added that the new legislation will affect “current and future” probes. \nHonduras has been roiled by deadly protests following a disputed Nov. 26 election, which the center-left opposition has accused Hernandez of stealing. The OAS comments reveal the many hurdles to overcome for the poor, graft-riddled country with one of the world’s highest murder rates. \nMACCIH has been involved in helping the Honduran prosecutor’s office investigate a 2011-2015 embezzlement scheme that diverted 1.3 billion lempiras ($55 million) destined for social funds, allegedly with the help of more than 60 lawmakers and high-ranking officials. \nJimenez said allies of the president in Congress are among the suspects, adding that the new law would paralyze investigations for three years while the government’s financial authorities trace the diverted funds. \nIn response, the Congress said in a statement that Jimenez’s comments were “malicious,” adding that the law sought to encourage transparency. \nThe president’s office did not immediately respond to MACCIH’s comments. \n($1 = 23.5760 lempiras)", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-24T22:14:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-24T22:24:24.007+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
