Diluted earnings per share were $.39 per share and $1.28 per share for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2017 compared to $.30 per share and $1.26 per share for the same periods in 2016. Return on average assets was 1.03% and .86% for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2017 compared to .73% and .76% for the same periods in 2016. Return on average equity was 9.04% and 7.78% for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2017 compared to 7.38% and 7.77% for the same periods in 2016.\n“We are pleased to report an increase in earnings year-to-year. Our net interest margin increased by 11 basis points to 3.32% and we significantly improved our asset quality. The recently signed tax bill has provided an immediate benefit to the bank and will provide a benefit going forward,” said Thomas M. Carr, President and CEO. He continued, “The repurchase in December of all our preferred shares at $9.4 million will, in future periods, reduce our preferred dividends and increase our earnings to common shareholders.”\nNet Income\nNet income totaled $4,851,000 for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017, an increase of $514,000 or 12% from the $4,337,000 of net income recorded for the same period in 2016. This increase was the net result of a decrease in income tax expense of $1.6 million and an increase in net interest income of $28,000, offset by decrease in noninterest income of $463,000, an increase in the provision for loan losses of $408,000, and an increase in noninterest expense of $282,000.\nNet income totaled $1,449,000 for the three months ended December 31, 2017, an increase of $407,000 or 39% from the $1,042,000 recorded for the same period in 2016. This increase was the net result of a decrease in income tax expense of $1.6 million, offset by a decrease in noninterest income of $197,000, an increase in noninterest expense of $627,000, a decrease in net interest income of $13,000, and an increase in the provision for loan losses of $405,000.\nThe enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (“the Act”) on December 22, 2017 reduces the federal corporate tax rate starting in 2018 from 34% to 21%. As a result of the enactment of the Act, the Bank was required under Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (“GAAP”) to adjust its net deferred tax liability in 2017 for the tax rate change. This adjustment resulted in a $1.2 million reduction in income tax expense for both the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2017.\nBasic and diluted earnings per share for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017 were $1.28 per share for both compared to $1.26 per share and $1.25 per share for the same period in 2016. Basic and diluted earnings per share for the three months ended December 31, 2017 were both $.39 per share compared to $.30 per share for both for the same period in 2016.\nNet Interest Margin\nThe net interest margin for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017 was 3.32% compared to 3.21% for the same period in 2016. The yield on average earning assets was 4.12% for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017 compared to 4.05% for the same period in 2016. The average cost of interest-bearing liabilities was .94% for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017 compared to 1.00% for the same period in 2016.\nThe net interest margin for the three months ended December 31, 2017 was 3.31% compared to 3.23% for the same period in 2016. The average yield on earning assets was 4.10% for the three months ended December 31, 2017 compared to 4.04% for the same period in 2016. The average cost of interest-bearing liabilities was 0.95% for both the three months ended December 31, 2017 and 2016.\nAssets\nTotal assets decreased $18.9 million or 3.3% to $554.6 million at December 31, 2017 compared to $573.5 million at December 31, 2016. Cash and cash equivalents decreased by $16.4 million or 67.5% to $7.9 million at December 31, 2017 compared to $24.3 million at December 31, 2016. Loans, including loans held for sale, increased 0.2% to $460.6 million at December 31, 2017 compared to December 31, 2016. The available-for-sale investment portfolio decreased $8.5 million from December 31, 2016 to December 31, 2017.\nNonperforming Loans\nOur nonperforming loans to total loans ratio has decreased to 0.64% at December 31, 2017 from 1.11% at December 31, 2016. Net loan charge-offs to average loans for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017 of 0.16% increased from 0.08% for the twelve months ended December 31, 2016. The allowance for loan losses was 0.97% of total loans at December 31, 2017 and 0.94% of total loans at December 31, 2016.\nLiabilities\nDeposits total $456.8 million at December 31, 2017, a decrease of $12.8 million or 2.7%. The $12.8 million decrease consists of a $13.7 million decrease in time deposits, a $3.5 million decrease in money market accounts, and a $282,000 decrease in savings accounts, partially offset by a $1.0 million increase in interest bearing transaction accounts and a $3.7 million increase in noninterest bearing accounts. Borrowed funds decreased by $7.0 million or 16.7%.\nShareholders’ Equity\nShareholders’ equity increased $1.0 million to $56.7 million at December 31, 2017 compared to December 31, 2016. The increase in shareholders’ equity includes the impact of the gross $9.5 million received from the private placement of 548,430 common shares in April 2017, as well as the repurchase of all 10,000 outstanding preferred shares for $9.4 million in December 2017. The preferred shares had been paying a quarterly dividend at an annual rate of 8.998%, which amounted to $900,000 in dividends paid out annually on preferred shares. The current level of shareholders’ equity equates to a book value per share of $17.07 at December 31, 2017, compared to $16.74 at December 31, 2016. Dividends paid to common shareholders were $0.23 and $0.93 for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2017 and were $0.23 and $0.92 for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2016.\nElmira Savings Bank, with $554.6 million in total assets, is insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) and is a state-chartered bank with six offices in Chemung County, NY; three offices in Tompkins County, NY; two offices in Steuben County, NY; one office in Cayuga County, NY; one office in Schuyler County; and a loan center in Broome County, NY.\nExcept for the historical information contained herein, the matters discussed in this news release are forward looking statements that involve the risks and uncertainties, including the timely availability and acceptance of Bank products, the impact of competitive products and pricing, the management of growth, and other risks detailed from time to time in the Bank’s regulatory reports.\nELMIRA SAVINGS BANK CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET (unaudited) (in thousands, except for share and per share data) December 31, December 31, 2017\n2016\n% Change ASSETS Cash and due from banks $ 7,800 $ 24,195 -67.8 % Federal funds sold and other short-term investments 97 99 -2.0 % Total cash and cash equivalents 7,897 24,294 -67.5 % Securities available for sale, at fair value 24,056 32,581 -26.2 % Securities held to maturity -
