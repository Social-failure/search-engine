LULA \nLuiz Inacio Lula da Silva, who has been convicted with corruption, is leading the polls in this year’s presidential election. \nWith a new trial for the former president only days away, \nTemer, who is not running, said he would prefer to see Lula losing in the election than in a court of law. \nTemer was once an ally of Lula’s Workers Party, but they split during the impeachment process that ousted Dilma Rousseff from the presidency. \n“We have to admit that if (Lula) were to be politically defeated, it would be better than being beaten (in a court), because he would be victimized,” Temer said. “Victimization is not good for a country and not good for a former president.” \nLula could lose the right to run if his appeal of the corruption conviction is denied in next week’s trial. He could leave the trial arrested.
