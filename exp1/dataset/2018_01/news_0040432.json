There could be many factors which did not lead to the satisfaction of the panel,” he said.\n“The purpose is to invite clean Russian athletes for which this panel is certain and has not the slightest doubt or suspicion.”\nReporting by Karolos Grohmann, Editing by Ossian Shine and Ken Ferris\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-24T17:01:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-24T17:14:29.024+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
