The investment will go to research projects on oceanic ecological protection and safety issues for sea-borne transportation. \nTo date, only the United States and France have laboratories capable of undertaking tests and inspections required in treating ocean oil spills, the report said. \nThe Iranian oil tanker Sanchi collided with a dry cargo vessel early this month about 160 nautical miles off China’s east coast, in the world’s worst oil tanker disaster for decades.
