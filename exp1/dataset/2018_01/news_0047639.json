While it enjoys good growth in its diabetes and obesity business, which accounts for around 80 percent of sales, the biopharmaceuticals division, which makes up nearly 20 percent of revenue led by haemophilia, is slowing.\nIt stands to lose sales particularly because of new competition from Roche’s haemophilia drug Hemlibra.\nNovo Nordisk logo is seen in Bagsvaerd outside of Copenhagen, Denmark February 1, 2017.
