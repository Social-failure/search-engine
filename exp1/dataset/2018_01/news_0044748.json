(NASDAQ: HFBC) (the “Company”), the holding company for Heritage Bank USA, Inc. (the “Bank”), today reported operating results for the three and twelve month periods ended December 31, 2017. For the three month period ended December 31, 2017, net income was $225,000, or $0.04 per share, compared to $1.1 million, or $0.18 per share, for the three month period ended December 31, 2016. For the twelve month period ended December 31, 2017, net income rose 27.5% to $3.7 million, or $0.60 per share, compared to $2.9 million, or $0.47 per share, for the twelve month period ended December 31, 2016. The results for the three months and year ended December 31, 2017 included a charge of $980,000, or $0.16 per share, related to the write-down of the Company’s deferred tax asset after President Trump signed the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 that reduced future federal corporate tax rates.\nCommenting on the fourth quarter results, John E. Peck, President and Chief Executive Officer, said, “We finished 2017 with a very strong year and reported record balances of loans. Our earnings showed solid progress compared with 2016 and our momentum more than offset the fourth quarter tax charge that arose from the newly enacted tax legislation. The write-down of the deferred tax asset had no effect on our asset quality and financial strength. We anticipate that the Company will recover our write-down of the deferred tax asset in fifteen months through lower future income taxes. We remain confident in our Company’s future earning potential due to our strong asset quality and a vibrant local economy.”\nFinancial Highlights\nIn the three month period ended December 31, 2017, loan growth was $11.7 million, representing an annualized growth rate of 7.4%. For the year ended December 31, 2017, loan growth was $31.5 million, or 5.2%, compared to December 31, 2016. At December 31, 2017, total loans originated and outstanding in the Nashville, Tennessee loan production office were $68.6 million, compared to $42.5 million at December 31, 2016. Non-accrual loans declined from $9.1 million, or 1.49% of total loans, at December 31, 2016 to $1.3 million, or 0.20% of total loans, at December 31, 2017. Loans classified as impaired were $29.3 million at December 31, 2016 and $10.8 million at December 31, 2017. In the three month period ended December 31, 2017, the Company sold foreclosed assets totaling $1.7 million for a net gain of $80,000. At December 31, 2017, the Company’s non-performing asset ratio improved to 0.52%, compared to 1.29% of total assets at December 31, 2016. For the three month period ended December 31, 2017, the Company purchased 50,903 shares of treasury stock at a weighted average cost of $14.23 per share. For the year ended December 31, 2017, the Company purchased 92,224 shares of treasury stock at a weighted average cost of $14.19 per share. At December 31, 2017, the Company held 1,338,360 shares of treasury stock with a weighted average cost of $12.44 per share. The Company may purchase an additional 300,000 shares of treasury stock under our current repurchase program.\nResults of Operations\nIn the three month periods ended December 31, 2017, September 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016, net interest income was $7.0 million, $7.1 million and $6.6 million, respectively. On a linked quarter basis, the reduction in net interest income was the result of lower average balances of loans. For the three month period ended December 31, 2017, the average balance of net loans was $631.5 million, compared to $637.0 million for the three month period ended September 30, 2017 and $589.3 million for the three month period ended December 31, 2016.\nIn the twelve month periods ended December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, net interest income was $27.8 million and $26.4 million, respectively. For the years ended December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, the average balance of loans was $626.7 million and $570.7 million, respectively. To fund loan growth, the Company utilized both deposit growth and cash flows from the securities portfolio. For the year ended December 31, 2017, the Company’s average balance of loans increased by $56.0 million while the Company’s average balance of deposits grew by $26.0 million.\nThe Company’s net interest margin for the three month periods ended December 31, 2017, September 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016 was 3.41%, 3.43% and 3.35%, respectively. On a linked quarter basis, the slight reduction in the net interest margin is largely the result of higher deposit balances and lower average balances of loans outstanding. The Company’s net interest margin for the twelve month periods ended December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016 was 3.38% and 3.35%, respectively.\nFor the three month periods ended December 31, 2017, the Company’s non-interest income was $1.9 million, compared to $2.0 million for the three month periods ended September 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016, respectively. For the three month period ended December 31, 2017, the Company experienced a $9,000 loss on the sale of securities, compared to a gain of $162,000 and $190,000 for three month periods ended September 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016, respectively. For the three month period ended December 31, 2017, service charge income was $801,000, compared to $819,000 and $694,000 for the three month periods ended September 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016, respectively. The increase in service charge income for the three and twelve month periods ended December 31, 2017, was the result of changes made to our consumer transaction accounts that reduced the amount of checking accounts not being assessed a service charge.\nFor the twelve month periods ended December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, non-interest income was $8.0 million and $7.9 million, respectively. The table below outlines the most significant changes in non-interest income for the twelve month period ended December 31, 2017 compared to December 31, 2016:\nDollar Percentage 12/31/17 12/31/16 Change Change (Dollars in Thousands, Except Percentages) Service charge income $ 3,224 $ 2,788 $ 436 15.64 % Mortgage origination income 1,321 1,585 (264 ) -16.66 % Gain on the sale of securities 169 612 (443 ) -72.39 % Income from bank owned life insurance\n483 343 140 40.82 % Financial services income 536 614 (78 ) -12.70 % Other operating income 1,075 769 306 39.79 % On a linked quarter basis, the Company’s non-interest expenses increased by $28,000. The small increase in non-interest expenses was largely the result of a $76,000 increase in professional services and a $125,000 increase in advertising expenses. For the three month period ended December 31, 2017, salaries and benefits expense increased $163,000, or 4.3% and professional services expenses increased $89,000, or 22.5%, compared to the three month period ended December 31, 2016. The increase in salaries and benefits expense includes approximately $40,000 related to health insurance and $80,000 related to employee payroll expenses. The increase in professional services expenses for the three and twelve month periods ended December 31, 2017 is largely the result of legal cost associated with a shareholder lawsuit and shareholder demand letter.\nThis information is preliminary and based on company data available at the time of the presentation\nResults of Operations (continued)\nFor the twelve month periods ended December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, non-interest expenses were $29.3 million and $29.9 million, respectively. The table below outlines the most significant changes in non-interest expenses for the twelve month period ended December 31, 2017 compared to December 31, 2016:\nDollar Percentage 12/31/17 12/31/16 Change Change (Dollars in Thousands, Except Percentages) Salaries and benefits $ 16,049 $ 15,400 $ 649 4.21 % Occupancy 2,920 3,173 (253 ) -7.97 % State deposit tax 770 990 (220 ) -22.22 % Professional services 1,706 1,404 302 21.51 % Foreclosure, net 9 448 (439 ) -97.99 % Other operating expenses 3,592 4,170 (578 ) -13.86 % For the twelve month period ended December 31, 2017, the increase in salary and benefits includes a $305,000 increase in the Company’s health insurance expense and a $344,000 increase in payroll expenses. The increase in professional services is largely the result of litigation tied to both a shareholder lawsuit and shareholder demand letter. In the twelve month period ended December 31, 2017, foreclosure expenses are lower due to a $400,000 reduction in the legal expenses required to take legal possession of properties and a $137,000 increase on gains on the sale of foreclosed assets, compared to the twelve month period ended December 31, 2016.\nBalance Sheet\nAt December 31, 2017, total assets were $917.3 million, compared to $891.5 million at December 31, 2016. During November and December of 2017, the Company experienced significant inflows in both commercial and government deposits. Management anticipates that this inflow of deposits will reverse themselves in the first quarter of 2018 due to the normal economic cycle of agri-business and government tax collections.\nIn 2017, the Company’s loan growth has occurred largely in the non-residential real estate and residential real estate loan portfolios. The Company seeks to further enhance loan growth with additional exposure in the areas of commercial and construction lending. We are actively seeking established lending professionals in our growth markets to enhance our prospects for future success.
