They were re-designated on Dec. 22.\n“The protection of religious freedom is vital to peace, stability, and prosperity,” the department said in a statement. “These designations are aimed at improving the respect for religious freedom in these countries.”\nU.S. President Donald Trump has criticized Pakistan for not doing more to combat terrorism, and his administration has informed members of Congress that it will announce plans to end “security assistance” payments to the country.\nPakistan has said it is already doing a lot to fight militants, and summoned the U.S. ambassador to explain a tweet by Trump that said the United States had been foolish in dispensing aid to Islamabad.\nReporting by Makini Brice; Editing by Tim Ahmann and Susan Thomas\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-04T16:57:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-04T17:03:03.017+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
