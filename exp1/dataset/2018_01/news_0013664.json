Now it’s out there in the open, we know how to deal with it.”\nDIEHARD DEFENDERS Rappler has not shied away from challenging Duterte and its reporters have frequently been threatened by his online army of supporters, often in response to social media postings by pro-Duterte bloggers, some in government.\nJournalists work at the office of Rappler in Pasig, Metro Manila, Philippines January 15, 2018. REUTERS/Dondi Tawatao It has published investigations critical of what its chief executive Maria Ressa said was the administration’s “weaponising” of the internet and creation of “an ecosystem used to cripple journalists”.\nThe administration has rejected that and Duterte has previously said he has no need for anyone to defend him.\nThe Foreign Correspondents Association of the Philippines said the SEC ruling was “tantamount to killing” Rappler, and “sends a chilling effect to media”.\nThe National Union of Journalists of the Philippines called on media to resist intimidation and said the decision was “but one of many threats Duterte has made against media critical of him and his governance”.\nThe move against Rappler comes at a challenging time for press freedom in Southeast Asia. Journalists are still being jailed in Myanmar even though decades of rule by a junta that tightly controlled the media has given way to a government led by Nobel peace laureate Aung San Suu Kyi.\nA crackdown on critics of Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Sen has led to the dissolution of the main opposition party and action against some independent media.\nMedia freedom watchdog Reporters Without Borders last year said the Philippines was fairly free and diverse, but dangerous for the media.\nIn its 2017 annual report, it said the Duterte “has alarmed media freedom defenders with his unveiled encouragement of violence against journalists”.\nDuterte’s spokesman, Harry Roque, said the SEC decision was about complying with the constitution, not infringing on press freedom.\n“No one is above the law,” he said. “Rappler has to comply.”\nThe two U.S.-based organisations that invested in Rappler are Omidyar Network, created by eBay founder and entrepreneur Pierre Omidyar, and North Base Media, which advocates independent media and was founded by three prominent foreign journalists.\nSEC Commissioner Antonieta Ibe told Reuters the decision was carefully reached and was not an attack on the media.\nThe decision could put into question other media groups that have issued PDR, including ABS-CBN and GMA Network, said Luis Teodoro, a former journalism professor at the University of the Philippines. “Do all that issued PDR have foreign ownership? Will the certificate of incorporation of the others also be cancelled?” Teodoro told DZMM radio.\nAdditional reporting by Manolo Serapio Jr in MANILA and John Chalmers in JAKARTA; Writing by Martin Petty; Editing by Robert Birsel\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-15T10:22:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-15T10:44:45.009+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
