Last year, Lenovo Group agreed to buy a majority stake in Fujitsu’s personal computer unit for up to $269 million in a bid to capture a larger share of a market that is battling weak sales as more people switch to mobile devices. \nThe Nikkei added that retaining the mobile division’s staff and factories will likely be a condition of the deal. The company, which wants to focus on its core information technology services business, is also expected to continue operating its Arrows brand under Polaris, Nikkei said. \nFujitsu, which spun off its mobile phone operations into a separate company in 2016, had drawn interest from other investment funds such as Britain’s CVC Capital Partners Ltd and Chinese personal computer maker Lenovo Group Ltd, the Nikkei reported last year.
