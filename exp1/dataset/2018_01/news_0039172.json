But that’s it. It was a good test for me. It was a lot of hours on court. Moments under pressure. \n”A lot of positive things that I managed well. \n“But being honest, too, moments like this helps to be more confident in yourself, in your body.” \nThe victory ensured Nadal, who lost a five-set classic to long-time rival Roger Federer in the final last year, will retain his world number one ranking. \nIt also put the Mallorcan equal second with Stefan Edberg on the number of quarter-final appearances in the Australian grand slam in the professional era. Federer, naturally, leads with 14. \nThe jet-heeled Schwartzman joined the grand slam quarter-final club at the U.S. Open, a milestone moment during an impressive rise up the rankings in 2017. \nNadal had seen off his first three opponents without dropping a set but it was soon clear at Rod Laver Arena that Schwartzman was cut from a different cloth. Tennis - Australian Open - Rod Laver Arena, Melbourne, Australia, January 21, 2018. Rafael Nadal of Spain celebrates winning against Diego Schwartzman of Argentina. REUTERS/Edgar Su TOP SPIN BOMBS \nThe 1.70m (5-ft 7-in) Argentine virtually needed a step-ladder to reach the bounce of Nadal’s top-spin bombs but he was all over the Spaniard’s serve from the get-go. \nHe grudgingly surrendered his own first, though, allowing Nadal to wrap up the first set in 45 minutes. \nFrom there the match went stratospheric in quality, each player landing blows like bare-knuckled prize-fighters. Slideshow (4 Images) \nAfter six breaks of serve and a feast of glorious shot-making, the fireworks continued in a frenzied tiebreak. \nSchwartzman cracked a blazing   lead 2-0, then outpointed the Spaniard with a backhand volley to move within two points of the set. \nThe pressure told as a forehand ballooned off the frame of Nadal’s racquet and another backhand sailed long to put the match on level terms. \nSchwartzman was pumped, but he left the court immediately, his extended break allowing Nadal time to marshal his forces. \nThe lefthander resumed with renewed vigour to break Schwartzman to love and after roaring to 5-2, he claimed the third set with an ace. \nThe momentum was now all with Nadal. He broke again quickly, leaving Schwartzman to curse loudly in Spanish and bicker with the chair umpire at the change of ends. \nThe 25-year-old kept swinging for the fences to the finish and saved a second match point by ripping a backhand winner down the line. \nNadal simply bided his time before pouncing on the third, a second serve dismissed with a sizzling return winner to keep his bid for a 17th grand slam title firmly on track.
