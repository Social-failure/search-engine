Issues with pilot rostering triggered last year’s mass flight cancellations.\nRyanair is negotiating with other unions across Europe, who have demanded to meet collectively with Ryanair, saying that individual talks were unsatisfactory. The airline has so far refused those demands,\n“We now call on these unions to stop wasting time and act quickly to deliver 20 percent pay increases to our pilots in February, and conclude formal recognition agreements, which they are presently sitting on,” Eddie Wilson, chief people officer at Ryanair, said in a statement.\nPilots at all Ryanair’s UK bases have voted to accept Ryanair’s proposed pay increase, with pilots at Stansted approving the package earlier this month. Those votes were separate to negotiations with BALPA.\nBALPA’s Strutton also said that he hoped Ryanair would be able to agree deals with other European unions soon.\n“I am hopeful that this is (the) beginning of a strong and mutually beneficial relationship between BALPA and Ryanair and I urge Ryanair to agree deals with pilot unions in other countries and with cabin crew unions,” Strutton said.\nReporting by Alistair Smout; editing by Kate Holton\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-01-30T16:13:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-31T16:24:30.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
