At Hingham, we take seriously our role as stewards of the shareholders’ capital. Our emphasis on careful capital allocation, defensive underwriting, process improvement, and disciplined cost control continues to serve our owners well. Performance in any one period, especially periods when tailwinds may be with us, should be viewed cautiously. Such periods are historically fraught with peril in our industry. The real test of performance in banking is a company’s record of compounding shareholder capital over time and through all stages of the credit cycle. On this measure, our team strives to set a high bar.”\nHingham Institution for Savings is a Massachusetts-chartered savings bank located in Hingham, Massachusetts.
