Many experts predict an imminent correction or even a full-blown crash, while some well-known market watchers have warned that today's stock market is the most overvalued on record — more so than in 1929, 2000 and 2007. \n\"We just don't know when (a correction) is going to happen,\" he added, \"but it's absolutely clear it is going to happen.\" show chapters ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-24T13:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-24T12:54:08.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
