Kichler Co. (“Kichler Lighting”), a leading developer of decorative residential and light commercial lighting products, ceiling fans and LED lighting systems across both consumer and professional distribution channels.\n“We are excited about the prospects of expanding Masco’s reach into the fragmented $6 billion U.S. residential lighting industry,” said Masco’s President and CEO, Keith Allman. “Kichler Lighting is a strong strategic fit with our focus on building products where brand, innovation and strength of distribution provide a competitive advantage. Kichler’s products share many of the same customers as numerous other Masco brands and will complement our current product offering while strengthening our relationships with these customers,” continued Allman.\nBased in Cleveland, Ohio, Kichler Lighting had revenues of approximately $450 million in 2017 and employs approximately 700 people worldwide. The transaction is expected to close in the first quarter of 2018, subject to customary closing conditions and regulatory review, and will be funded with cash on hand. Masco intends to report the financial results of Kichler Lighting in its Decorative Architectural Products segment.\nAdditionally, Masco announced that it acquired Mercury Plastics, Inc. (“Mercury”) in the fourth quarter of 2017. Mercury is a plastics processor and manufacturer of water handling systems for appliance and faucet applications, as well as other highly engineered plumbing products, tubing, and assemblies. Based in Middlefield, Ohio, Mercury had revenues of approximately $45 million in 2017 and employs approximately 300 people. Masco intends to report the financial results of Mercury in its Plumbing Products segment.\n“We are extremely pleased to welcome the Kichler Lighting and Mercury teams to the Masco family,” said Allman. “We believe that, because of our rigorous acquisition process and patience, these acquisitions will be accretive to our earnings in 2018 and will demonstrate Masco’s ability to deliver on our strategic initiatives to create significant shareholder value. We expect to provide a more in-depth update on these transactions on our fourth quarter earnings conference call on February 8, 2018,” concluded Allman.\nAbout Masco\nHeadquartered in Livonia, Michigan, Masco Corporation is a global leader in the design, manufacture and distribution of branded home improvement and building products.
