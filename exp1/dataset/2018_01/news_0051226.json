Less than 5 percent of 600,000 people are affected, the company has said.\nThe New York insurer said it expects to increase reserves in total between $525 million and $575 million on a pre-tax basis.\nThat would result in a hit to fourth-quarter earnings of between $135 million and $165 million, the company said.\nLast month, the company said it failed to pay pensions to potentially tens of thousands of people and will have to strengthen its reserves because of the costs of finding and repaying them.
