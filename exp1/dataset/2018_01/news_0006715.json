Tennis - Wimbledon - London, Britain - July 10, 2017 Germany’s Angelique Kerber in action during her fourth round match against Spain’s Garbine Muguruza REUTERS/Andrew Couldridge \nFormer world number one Kerber made short work of Gavrilova, beating the Australian 6-1 6-2 to give Germany the upper hand. \nAustralia levelled the tie after Thanasi Kokkinakis upset world number four Zverev 5-7 7-6(4) 6-4, leaving Germany facing a must-win mixed doubles match to progress to the final. \nKokkinakis helped Australia to win the first set of the doubles but Kerber maintained her fiery dominance to steer Germany to a 1-4 4-1 4-3(3) victory. \n“Angie played unbelievable in both of her matches — she’s the reason we’re in the final,” Zverev said. “I‘m going to give all the credit to her. I didn’t play my best today — luckily I have an unbelievable partner.” \nEarlier, Belgium whitewashed Canada 3-0 and were on course to reach the final as group winners before Germany’s victory led them to the top. \nElise Mertens beat Canada’s Eugenie Bouchard 6-4 6-4 to hand Belgium the advantage and David Goffin sealed the tie for the European side with a 6-2 6-4 win over Vasek Pospisil. \nGermany last won the Hopman Cup in 1995 and in Saturday’s final they will face an all-conquering Swiss team with Roger Federer and Belinda Bencic yet to lose a match in the tournament.
