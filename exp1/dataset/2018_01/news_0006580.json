The bank had warned that the fourth quarter could be rough and confirmed that view on Friday.\nRevenue at Deutsche Bank's cash-generating bond-trading division were expected to drop 22 percent from a year ago, the bank said.\nDeutsche Bank's shares extended losses after the announcement and were down 4.4 percent by 1557 GMT. Before the announcement, shares were down about 2 percent.\nThe bank is due to report fourth-quarter and full-year earnings on Feb. 2.\nCorrection: Reuters updated this story to correct the time frame of the loss.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-05T17:41:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-05T18:08:39.009+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
