Beyond that area, Ocean Infinity will receive $70 million, Liow said. \nOcean Infinity’s priority is to locate the wreckage or the black box recorders - flight and cockpit recorders - or both, and present credible evidence to confirm their location, Liow added. \nLast week, Ocean Infinity said it had moved the vessel closer to a possible search area. The vessel left Durban, South Africa, on Jan. 2 and was headed to Perth, Australia, Reuters shipping data showed. \nThe MH370 debris could furnish clues to events on board before the aircraft crashed. There have been competing theories that it suffered mechanical failure or was intentionally flown off course. \nInvestigators believe someone may have deliberately switched off the plane’s transponder before diverting it thousands of miles out over the Indian Ocean. \nAt least three pieces of aircraft debris collected from sites on Indian Ocean islands and along Africa’s east coast have been confirmed as being from the missing plane.
