Passengers were advised not to get off and walk to the station, about a kilometre away, for safety reasons, he said. \nHeavy snowfall - more than 10 times the average in some areas - has snarled transportation across northern and western Japan. \nThe train was stuck in Sanjo city, about 300 km (190 miles) northwest of Tokyo. Sanjo was expecting as much as 20 cm (8 inches) of snow in a six-hour period on Friday.
