They're shithole countries ... We should have more people from Norway.\"\nIn one of several Twitter posts on Friday, Trump defended his stance on a bipartisan Senate immigration deal, but denied using the vulgar language ascribed to him.\n\"The language used by me at the DACA (Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals) meeting was tough, but this was not the language used,\" he said. He also later denied using derogatory language about Haitians.\n\"On behalf of Norway: Thanks, but no thanks,\" tweeted Torbjoern Saetre, a politician representing Norway's Conservative Party in a municipality near Oslo.\nOthers condemned the U.S. president's comments as inappropriate or racist.\n\"We are not coming.
