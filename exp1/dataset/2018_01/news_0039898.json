The accident caused disruption to rail traffic and some trains had to be re-routed.

REUTERS/Stringer \nRFI said it had detected some structural collapse in the track but that it was still unclear whether this was a cause or a consequence of the accident. \n“The rail track collapse was detected 2.3 kilometres before the spot of the accident, just before the Pioltello platform... but it is premature to establish the dynamics of the accident,” RFI regional director Vincenzo Macello told reporters. Slideshow (3 Images) \nMacello added that maintenance work was regularly carried out on the track and that it was constantly monitored. \nA spokesperson for Trenord said the train had been travelling at a normal speed as it approached the station. Trenord is a joint venture between railway operator FNM and Trenitalia, an FS unit. \n“There are precedents... but our (rail) system is among the safest in Europe. What worries us is maintenance, often carried out by subcontractors and not railway staff,” union secretary Adriano Coscia said on SKY TG24 television. \nMilan Mayor Beppe Sala called for more investment in Italy’s infrastructure to improve transport safety.
