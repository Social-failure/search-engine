REUTERS/Daniel Becerril Such funds are conditional on the federal government’s budgetary room for maneuver and were ultimately not paid to Chihuahua, or to a number of other states, Messmacher said.\n“But they’re not funds they have a right to,” he said.\nJavier Corral Jurado, Governor of the state of Chihuahua, speaks during a news conference in Mexico City, Mexico January 8, 2018. REUTERS/Daniel Becerril The dispute risks keeping attention focused on alleged PRI graft in the run-up to a presidential election in July. Tackling corruption promises to be a key campaign issue, and the PRI faces an uphill struggle to hold on to power.\nAfter noticing the holdup in federal transfers, Corral said, he and aides held a meeting with top ministry officials in Mexico City on the evening of Jan. 4 to discuss the impasse.\nThere, Corral added, the Chihuahua delegation was told that his state’s investigation into alleged corruption had called “into question the mechanism of how funds are transferred,” for which reason the ministry decided to withhold the money.\nProsecutors in Chihuahua accuse Gutierrez of participating in a scheme to divert public funds worth 250 million pesos into PRI coffers during the 2016 election season, in which Cesar Duarte’s successor was chosen. Gutierrez has denied the charge.\nA Mexican judge issued an arrest warrant for Duarte last March. Corral says his predecessor is in the United States.\nReporting by Dave Graham and Ana Isabel Martinez; Additional reporting by Lizbeth Diaz; Editing by Matthew Lewis and Leslie Adler\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-09T07:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-09T09:41:03.829+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
