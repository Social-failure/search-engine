In 1987 he launched the Bocuse d‘Or, pitting 24 chefs from across the world against each other in what continues to be the world’s most prestigious cooking competition.\nInternational chef Daniel Boulud, one of those who worked under Bocuse, told the Wall Street Journal in 2011: “After over 40 years of cooking, I am as impressed by him today as I was when I first met him as a 14-year-old apprentice trailing after him in the markets of Lyon. I have been continually inspired by his mission to support French cuisine.”\nBocuse was widely credited as a founder of French “nouvelle cuisine” - a more delicate style of cooking that relied less on heavy sauces. But he himself shunned the label, maintaining that above all meals should be “an uninhibited pleasure” and not encumbered by concerns about good health or weight loss.\nThe legendary black truffle soup he made for Giscard D‘Estaing, still served at his restaurants, is enduring testimony to recipes far richer than those with which the ‘nouvelle’ label came to be equated.\nFILE PHOTO: French chef Paul Bocuse's portrait is seen during a press visit for the opening of the new restaurant-school of the Institut Paul Bocuse in Lyon, November 7, 2013.

He had a son, Jerome, who now works for the American side of the Bocuse business, with his first mistress, Raymone, in 1969. And he launched a Bocuse-brand products business in the 1970s with his second mistress Patricia.\nIn a book published in 2006 shortly after yet another heart operation, Bocuse was Quote: d as summing up: “I have three stars.
