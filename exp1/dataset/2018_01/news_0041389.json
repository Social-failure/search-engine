The major consumer of polyurethanes and nylon 66 is the automotive sector. The advantage of nylon 66 is that it reduces the load-carrying capacity and stiffness in automotive vehicles. Polyurethane is an elastomer used in flexible foam seating, foam insulation panels, elastomeric wheels and tires, and hard plastic parts. It is tough, flexible, and resistant to weather, ozone, and radiation in nature. Adipic acid, derived from nitric acid, is used as a raw material to manufacture both polyurethanes and nylon 66.\nAccording to a senior analyst at Technavio for specialty chemicals research, “Countries such as China, India, and Brazil are establishing increasing demand for agrochemical, which is driving the growth rate of ammonium nitrate in the fertilizers segment. However, demand for calcium ammonium nitrate and urea ammonium nitrate is growing at a faster rate. The global agrochemical industry will propel the demand for concentrated nitric acid due to the rising demand for crop protection products and nitrogen fertilizers.”\nLooking for more information on this market?
