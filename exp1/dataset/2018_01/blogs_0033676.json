The 30-year-old Hollywood screenwriter graduated from Barnard College in May 2009 and found early success as a writer's assistant on the 2011 Primetime Emmy Awards and a member of the Fox Writers Initiative. \nYet Suh says she spent the better part of her 20s being a perfectionist, avoiding risks and listening to \"self-sabotaging, patriarchal\" thoughts that kept her from reaching her full potential. \"DIY Rules for a WTF World\" is the culmination of advice Suh gave herself and to friends over a decade to \"be productive and happy.\" A post shared by Krista Suh (@kristasuh) on Jan 7, 2018 at 8:05am PST \n\"My hope is that women and women's rights supporters can read this book and have the confidence to pursue whatever ambitious idea they have in their heart. It doesn't have to be a craftivist project like the Pussyhat Project, but my goal is to empower the next wave of activists and leaders,\" Suh says. \nBased on her new book and an interview with CNBC Make It, here are three of Suh's career tips for success. 1. It's okay to be a beginner \nWhen Suh first got the idea to knit the pussy hat, knitting had barely just become an obsession for her. As she made plans to visit Washington D.C. for the Women's March, she figured she would need a hat to keep her warm. \nAs a beginner knitter, Suh thought to herself, \"If I can knit this hat, anyone can.\" She envisioned an ocean of pink hat-wearers and turned her DIY-hat into a community art project. A post shared by Krista Suh (@kristasuh) on Dec 10, 2016 at 10:28am PST \n\"If I hadn't shifted my focus away from being perfect at the very beginning of something new, I would never have done the Pussyhat Project,\" Suh writes in her book. \"I would have allowed perfectionism to get in my own way.\" \nAhead of the 2017 march, the pussy hat knitting pattern had been downloaded over 60,000 times from her website and hundreds of sellers on Etsy and Amazon sold the hats ready to wear. \n\"Oftentimes, leaders are afraid to be beginners and find 'training wheels' — like taking a class or hiring a teacher to learn new skills — too babyish,\" Suh says. \"But I would argue that the people who succeed the most are the ones who aren't afraid of looking foolish and practicing on training wheels.\" 2. Focus your goals \nThe idea for a Women's March surfaced immediately after Trump's election on November 8, 2016, as marginalized communities across the country felt unsettled, Terry Stein reported in the Washington Post in 2017. \nBy the time Suh and Zweiman came up with the idea of sharing the pussy hat with other women's rights supporters, plans to follow through with the march were in full effect. So they decided to focus their efforts on an area that seemingly no one else had yet covered: creating a way for anyone, anywhere to participate in the march.

Still able to knit, Zweiman focused on her craft and contributed to the iconic tide of pink hats. \n\"While we welcomed people to make hats for their local marches, we all put efforts into getting hats to the Washington D.C. march,\" Suh says. \n\"I focused just on the hats for the march, not the organization of the whole march or the route,\" Suh adds. \"Focusing on one great detail can help you create the biggest impact and it frees up time for you to up your self-care and to have fun.\" 3. Figure out when you do your best work \nUnderstanding the rhythms of your body and mind are crucial to knowing when you are most likely to be more or less productive, Suh says. She calls this process \"inhaling\" and \"exhaling.\" \nWhen you inhale, you are taking in new experiences, saying yes to opportunities and exploring your interests. When you exhale, you enter a time of intense focus, digest what you have learned and making your vision a reality. \nFor Suh, the summer of 2016 was an inhaling period when she explored knitting. \n\"At the time, a lot of my relatives judged me because it appeared that I wasn't working or doing anything significant and fruitful,\" she writes. \"Had I not spent that time inhaling, I would not have been able to exhale the Pussyhat Project in the fall.\" \nThe key to leveraging your natural rhythm, she says, is recognizing you don't have control over which stage you are in, but you can learn how to make the most of each one. \n\"A lot of times, our discomfort in life comes from either needlessly questioning the stage of life were are in or staying in a stage too long out of fear of change,\" Suh writes. \"If I simply noted and accepted I was in an inhale stage rather than beating myself up over being so unfocused, I might have made progress and met my goals more quickly.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-20T16:31:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-20T17:30:45.012+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
