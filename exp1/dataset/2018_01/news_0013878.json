Japanese markets were closed on Monday for a national holiday.\nFast Retailing Co rose 2.3 percent after the clothing company said on Friday that its same-store sales at its Uniqlo clothing outlets in Japan rose 18.1 percent in December on the year. Fast Retailing contributed a hefty 25 positive points to the Nikkei index, the biggest contributor.\nChip making equipment manufacturers and electronic components makers outperformed, with Tokyo Electron rising 1.7 percent and TDK Corp adding 1.2 percent.\nElsewhere, paper stocks lost ground, with Oji Holdings shedding 1.4 percent and Nippon Paper Industries skidding 0.2 percent.\nThe broader Topix was 0.2 percent higher at 1,884.15 after touching 1,895.26, a level not seen since June 1991.\nEditing by Sam Holmes\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-01-09T10:31:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-09T15:05:05.003+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
