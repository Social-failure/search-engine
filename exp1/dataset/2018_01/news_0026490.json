China is next best with 30 followed by Canada with 28. \nOf the 26 Winter Games gold medals won by South Korean athletes, short track speed skaters have claimed 21 and data company Gracenote has tipped the hosts to add to their golden haul in both the men and women’s 1,000m and 1,500m events at the Feb. 9-25 Games. \nShim Suk-hee, a gold, silver and bronze medal winner in Sochi, is back eager to add to her resume while Choi Min-jeong is a gold medal threat in every race. After being shut out in Sochi, Korea’s men are also fired up to make amends on home ice. \n“I’ve been preparing to be in top form at the Olympics,” Choi told reporters earlier this month during a conference call from the South Korean National Training Center. “I‘m doing well, I think. If there is a possibility (for four gold), it will be better for me to get as much as I can.” Editing by Peter Rutherford", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-18T15:16:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-18T15:34:05.012+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
