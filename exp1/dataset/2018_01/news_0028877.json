European and other seed makers say the process does not involve the transfer of genes between species as in GMOs and is a valuable tool to boost yields.\nMichal Bobek, whose advice as advocate general is not binding but usually followed by European Court of Justice (ECJ) judges, said European Union rules on GMOs exempted mutagenesis and did not differentiate between old and new techniques.\n“The advocate general does not see any grounds deriving from the general duty to update legislation ... which could affect the validity of the mutagenesis exemption,” Bobek said in a statement, adding EU states, such as France, could draw up their own rules provided they conformed with EU law.\nA group of French agricultural associations had appealed to the ECJ, saying plant varieties obtained via mutagenesis should not be exempt from GMO rules under French law.\nThe ECJ will rule on the issue in coming months.\nGenetically modified (GM) crops are subject to scientific scrutiny and their approval often held up because the European Union’s 28 members fail to agree, even though they can individually opt out of any approval.\nThe EU allows the import of more than 50 GM crops and, while approval covers human consumption, they are exclusively used as animal feed. Only one GM crop, a variety of maize, is grown in Europe.
