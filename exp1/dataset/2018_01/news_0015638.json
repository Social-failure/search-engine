The quake was measured at a depth of 4 kilometers, the ministry noted. \nThe ministry of the Central American country said the earthquakeâ€™s epicenter was in San Marcos, a municipality a few miles south of the capital. \nThe U.S. Geological Survey did not report any earthquake occurring in El Salvador on Thursday, but did show a 5-magnitude quake in Costa Rica earlier in the day. \nThere were no immediate reports of casualties or damage, local emergency services said. \nOn Tuesday, a 7.6-magnitude quake struck in the Caribbean near remote islands belonging to Honduras. Although the quake could be felt across northern Central America, there have been no reports of deaths or major damage.
