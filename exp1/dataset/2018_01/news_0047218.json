(OTCQX:WBBW), the holding company (the “Company”) for Westbury Bank (the “Bank”), today announced net income of $314,000, or $0.09 per common share for the three months ended December 31, 2017 compared to net income of $747,000, or $0.20 per common share for the three months ended December 31, 2016.\nKirk Emerich, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, said, \"We are pleased that we are able to report net income for the quarter, even after the negative impact of the one-time adjustment to our deferred tax asset due to the passage of Federal tax reform in December 2017 which reduced the Federal corporate tax rate to 21% as of January 1, 2018. The adjustment to the deferred tax asset resulted in $923,000 of additional income tax expense, or $0.26 per common share and $0.25 per diluted common share, which directly impacted net income for the quarter. However, the reduced tax rate will result in reduced Federal income tax expense for the Company for fiscal 2018 and beyond.\"\nEmerich continued, \"During the quarter, we continued our stock repurchase program. For the three months ended December 31, 2017, we purchased 175,195 shares. As of December 31, 2017, there were 3,836,957 shares of common stock outstanding.\"\nAbout Westbury Bancorp, Inc.\nWestbury Bancorp, Inc. is the holding company for Westbury Bank.
