He declined to comment on whether prosecutors would seek to have him extradited.\nProsecutors said that between 2009 and 2014, Najera assisted in large-scale trafficking of cocaine from Colombia and elsewhere through Honduras, which U.S. authorities have long identified as a major transshipment point for drugs being smuggled into the United States.\nNajera helped arrange clandestine landing strips, protected by heavily armed gunmen, for aircraft ferrying cocaine into Honduras, the prosecutors said. They said the cocaine was then sold to Mexico’s Sinaloa Cartel and ultimately imported into the United States.\nNajera was also charged with taking part in a cocaine trafficking operation that involved payment of a $50,000 bribe to Fabio Lobo, the son of former Honduran President Porfirio Lobo.\nProsecutors said in Thursday’s indictment that drug traffickers paid bribes to Honduran officials, including members of the national congress, to ensure safe passage of drugs through the country.\nFabio Lobo was arrested in a DEA sting in 2015, pleaded guilty to conspiring to import cocaine into the United States and was sentenced to 24 years in prison in September.\nU.S. prosecutors have charged several other prominent Hondurans with involvement in drug trafficking.\nYankel Rosenthal, who served as minister of investment under current President Juan Orlando Hernandez, was sentenced to two years and five months in prison on Friday after he pleaded guilty to attempting to launder drug proceeds on behalf of a Honduran lawyer.\nRosenthal’s cousin, Yani Rosenthal, was previously sentenced to three years, and his father, former Honduran vice president Jaime Rosenthal, was charged but remains at large.\nReporting By Brendan Pierson in New York; Additional reporting by Gustavo Palencia in Tegucigalpa; Editing by Tom Brown\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-20T01:14:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-20T01:28:14.021+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
