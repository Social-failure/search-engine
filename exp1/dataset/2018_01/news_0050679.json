We are seeing the systematic looting of countries,” said Christensen. “The sums involved are enormous.” \nOther countries that were ranked among the most significant secretive centers included the Cayman Islands, Luxembourg and Germany. Hong Kong and Singapore were also among the top 10. \nThe study adds to a wider debate about the use of such centers after the publication of the Panama Papers, which showed that some companies set up in tax havens may have been used for money laundering, arms and drug deals as well as tax evasion. \nThat embarrassed leaders worldwide who had interests tied to secretive business concerns. \nSwitzerland, the world’s largest center for overseas wealth, will gradually dismantle bank secrecy this year when it begins sending information about its customers’ accounts to foreign tax agencies. \nThe Alpine country’s multi-trillion-dollar financial industry has, however, sought safeguards to protect against misuse of this information, a step critics said was a back-door attempt to continue with secrecy. \nThe Swiss government is now considering how wide such protection should be as it further rolls back bank secrecy. \nPressure on Switzerland built after a U.S.-led crackdown starting in 2008 publicized practices used by its bankers to keep money hidden from tax authorities, from smuggling diamonds in toothpaste tubes to hiding documents in the pages of Sports Illustrated. \nThe United States Treasury did not respond immediately to a request for comment.
