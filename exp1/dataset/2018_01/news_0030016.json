He denied having any such intention.\nArmenian presidents will now be elected by a three-quarters majority of parliament, rather than voters, and serve only one seven-year term under the constitutional amendments. The opposition has yet to announce its candidate for the March vote.\nThe Republican Party (RPA) won parliamentary elections in April last year with 49 percent of the vote while the opposition Tsarukyan Alliance took 27 percent.\nSarksyan, 62, leader of the RPA and president since 2008, has repeatedly denied the constitutional changes were engineered to allow him to retain domination over Armenian politics.\nMany Armenians accuse the government of corruption and of mishandling the troubled economy. Armenia depends heavily for aid and investment on Russia.\nReporting by Hasmik Mkrtchyan; writing by Vladimir Soldatkin; editing by Mark Heinrich\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-19T17:11:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-19T17:45:45.001+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
