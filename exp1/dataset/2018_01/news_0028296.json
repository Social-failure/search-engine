It is the first such decision in Slovenia and one of the first in the European Union,” the lawyer, Robert Preininger, told Reuters. \n“The main reason for such a decision is that banks were aware of high risks and of a possibility of depreciation of the Swiss franc but did not inform consumers of those risks while they expected to profit on that account. That was a very immoral business practice,” he said. \nPreininger declined to give details about the loan or borrower. \nAccording to the court decision the borrower must repay the Slovenian unit of Austrian bank Sparkasse only the amount of loan received without any interest, Preininger said. \nHe said this meant the total repayment will be at least 60 percent lower than it would have been if the loan was not cancelled. \nSparkasse told Reuters it has not yet received the decision and gave no further comment. The court - the appellate High Court in Ljubljana - gave no immediate comment. \nThe Bank of Slovenia told Reuters later on Friday that the total outstanding amount of loans in Swiss francs fell to 461 million euros in November, down from 524 million euros in May 2017. They represented 7.2 percent of all real-estate loans but only 0.2 percent of all loans to companies. \nThe central bank gave no comment on the ruling. \nAccording to local media a total of about 20,000 loans denominated in Swiss francs were given to individuals and companies by Slovenian banks.
