It was not required to carry a black box flight data recorder because it had fewer than 19 passengers.\nTen U.S. citizens and two Costa Rican pilots, both of whom were experienced fliers, died in the incident, Cubillo said.\nThe U.S. victims included a family of five from New York.\nCosta Rica’s accident investigation team has begun examining the remains of the Cessna 208B Grand Caravan, which crashed and ignited in a woodland roughly 1,310 feet (400 meters) from its departure point.\nRemains of the plane’s turbine will be sent to producer Pratt & Whitney in Canada for mechanical evaluations.\nA video obtained from the civil aviation agency showed twisted and charred chunks of metal that are being examined by investigators, including pieces of the turbine, tail rudder and wings.\nThe plane had passed a safety inspection about a month ago and was authorized to fly, Cubillo has previously said. Although strong winds in the morning had forced the pilots to alter their itinerary, they had flown safely to Punta Islita to pick up passengers headed to San Jose.\nCubillo added on Thursday that strong winds at the time of the crash should not have impacted the flight.\n“There were winds of some 20, 25 knots ... a speed that isn’t ideal, but that should be perfectly withstood by an aircraft of this wingspan,” he said.\nWriting by Daina Beth Solomon; Editing by Lisa Shumaker\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-05T01:53:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-05T02:19:15.034+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
