I went to all his practice sessions with a new ball. He signed it every day. I don’t know if he remembers.” \nTsonga needed five sets to see off another young gun in Denis Shapovalov in round two on Tuesday and Kyrgios thinks the crowd are going to be in for another entertaining contest. \n“I’ve seen him play a lot,” he said. “I know what he’s going to bring. He knows what I‘m going to bring. It’s going to be a lot of fun.” \nKyrgios played his first two matches on his more favoured Hisense Arena but said he was ready to move on to Rod Laver Arena after a string of distractions in his match against Troicki. \n“Rod Laver is one of the best stadiums in the world ... I think I’ll be fine on it,” he said. \nThree-times Australian Open champion Mats Wilander, though, said that Kyrgios might miss the energy of the crowd on Hisense. \n“I think the problem will be when he moves from Hisense Arena which is ground pass holders and a wild crowd to moving to the Rod Laver Arena,” he told Reuters. \n“It’s a different crowd at Rod Laver Arena. They obviously root for him but they’re not as young and as wild, they’re more neutral.” (Reporting by Nick Mulvenney in Sydney,  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-18T16:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-18T16:33:12.003+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
