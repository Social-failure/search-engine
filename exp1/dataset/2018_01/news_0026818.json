Strong winds pushed it away from the Chinese coast, where the incident happened, and into Japan’s exclusive economic zone (EEZ).\nThe ship, which was carrying 136,000 tonnes or almost a million barrels of condensate - an ultra-light, highly flammable crude oil - sank after several explosions weakened the hull.\nOn Tuesday, Japan’s environment ministry said it doesn’t see much chance that the spill will reach its shores.\nReporting by Josephine Mason; editing by Richard Pullin\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-01-17T09:43:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-17T19:47:08.016+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
