It is a challenge for the shipping companies, it makes their operation more difficult,” Minister of Transport and Communications Anne Berner told Reuters.\n“There have been inspections by Russian ports for ships from other countries as well, but in this time range, most of the inspections have been carried out on Finnish ships.”\nThe Russian transportation ministry declined to comment but Berner said that seafaring authorities from the two countries had held discussions, with talks due to continue next week.\n“It seems these inspections will not continue for the time being. We will confirm this on Monday in a call between ministries”, Berner said.\nEU-member Finland shares a 1,340km (833 miles) border and a difficult history with Russia. It has accused Moscow of several airspace violations and propaganda attacks in recent years.\nFinnish media have suggested the increase in Russian port inspections could be in response to an inspection by Finland on a Russian cargo ship in November because of an oil leak.\nBerner described such claims as speculation.\n“There is no evidence of connection (to Finland’s inspection),” the minister said.\nUnder international seafaring law, inspectors can hold a ship back at ports if it lacks certificates or poses some kind of security threat.\nReporting by Jussi Rosendahl and Tuomas Forsell; Additional reporting by Gleb Stolyarov in Moscow; Editing by David Goodman\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-01-12T19:07:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-12T18:29:45.016+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
