They don’t need us arguing and entering conflict,” Sisi said at an inauguration of new projects in the province of Monofeya.\nHe said Egypt would not interfere in other countries’ affairs. Khartoum has in the past accused Cairo of political meddling while Egypt has accused Sudan of harboring Egyptian Islamists.\n“Egypt will not fight its brothers ... I‘m saying this as a message to our brothers in Sudan,” Sisi said.\nKhartoum and Ankara agreed last month that Turkey would rebuild a ruined Ottoman port city on Sudan’s Red Sea coast and construct a dock to maintain civilian and military vessels.\nEgyptian officials reacted with suspicion about what they see as Turkey’s plans to expand its influence in the region.\nSeparately, Ethiopia is building a hydroelectric dam on the Nile which Cairo fears will restrict the waters flowing down from Ethiopia’s highlands and through Sudan to Egypt.\nEthiopia, which wants to become Africa’s biggest power exporter, says it will have no such impact.\nEgypt believes Sudan is leaning toward the Ethiopian position in the dispute.\nThe Ethiopian foreign minister, who held talks with his Sudanese counterpart on Sunday, is expected to visit Cairo later this week for negotiations after multiple delays.\nReporting by Mohamed El Sherif; Writing by Arwa Gaballa; Editing by Peter Graff\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-01-16T00:07:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-16T13:19:59.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
