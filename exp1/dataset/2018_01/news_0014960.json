It takes about 10 minutes to do, and requires one administrator per test taker. The questions range from identifying certain kinds of animals, to repeating back specific sets of words. \nIf you want to take the test, find someone to administer it, and then have them c lick here to read the instructions for administering the MoCa. \nIf you're the test taker, here it is. \nGood luck.
