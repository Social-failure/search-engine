REUTERS/Joshua Roberts/File Photo \nTexas lost the largest number, at 455, and Ohio was a close second, losing 414, according to the data. \nPennsylvania, which gained 96 jobs in 2017, is also expected to go negative soon after Dana Mining announced this month it would close a mine employing about 400 people. \nOverall, the number of U.S. coal jobs is still lingering near historic lows at less than one-third the level in the mid-1980s, according to Bureau of Labor Statistics data, as the industry loses market share to cheaper natural gas. \n(Click here for a graphic: tmsnrt.rs/2DOsZk2 ) \nThe bright spots in the industry in 2017 came amid a big surge in demand for shipments from overseas, said Luke Popovich, a spokesman for the National Mining Association. \n“We have seen production rise this past year by more than six percent and exports rise five-fold over the previous year,” he told Reuters. \n”Honest people can differ over how much credit the president deserves for this revival and how much credit belongs to market forces,“ he added. ”To those of us closest to the coal industry, there is little question that the administration’s regulatory reset ... has made a decisive difference.” Editing by Richard Valdmanis, Marguerita Choy and Andrew Hay", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "http://tmsnrt.rs/2DOsZk2"], "published": "2018-01-19T20:02:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-19T14:12:01.004+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
