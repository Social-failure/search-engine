Some Australian states ruled homosexual acts to be illegal until just 20 years ago. \nBecause a month’s notice is required for the state to recognise a marriage, the Rieberos’ wedding and several other same-sex marriages reported in the local press were among the first to be recognised under the new laws. \nSeveral same-sex couples already wed in December after the notice period was waived for reasons such as one member of the couple falling gravely ill, or to allow a legal wedding to go ahead when a non-binding ceremony was already planned. \nReligious organisations and conservative lawmakers had voiced strong opposition to same-sex marriage and pressed unsuccessfully for broad protections for religious objectors, which would have allowed florists and bankers to refuse service to same-sex couples if the unions were legalised.
