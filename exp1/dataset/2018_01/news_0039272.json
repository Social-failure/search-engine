Doha vehemently denies the charges.\nThe government of Qatar issued its last international bond in 2016, raising $9 billion through the debt sale. There is no clarity on the size of the upcoming, potential bond sale, but banking sources say Qatar will likely raise a similar amount.\nA spokesman for the government did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\nGovernments in the Gulf have been borrowing huge amounts of money internationally over the past few years to refill their coffers, hit by a slump in oil prices.\nQatar’s request for proposal (RFP) comes just after Saudi Arabia’s RFP, sent out to banks last week, for the refinancing of an outstanding $10 billion syndicated loan and for further U.S. dollar-denominated bond sales.\nReporting by Hadeel Al Sayegh and Tom Arnold; Writing by Davide Barbuscia; Editing by Sam Holmes\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-01-23T14:33:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-24T15:29:28.001+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
