Activity has come down as investors are waiting to see the direction,” said Dimantha Mathew, head of research, First Capital Holdings. \nThe bourse hit a near two-month high on Monday as declining interest rates and expectations of higher economic growth boosted investor appetite for risky assets. \nShares in Sri Lanka Telecom Plc ended 2.4 percent weaker while conglomerate John Keells Holdings Plc ended 0.9 percent down. \nAccess Engineering Company Plc, which on Wednesday said its net profit for financial year 2017/18 will see a rise of more than 10 percent, ended 0.9 percent higher. \nTreasury bill rates fell between March and December last year, mainly driven by foreign buying in treasury bonds, resulting in a decline in interest rates. \nThe country’s 2018 economic growth trajectory is likely to help boost market sentiment, analysts said. \nSri Lanka’s economic growth in 2018 is forecast at 5-5.5 percent, against an anticipated four-year low of less than 4 percent last year, central bank governor Indrajit Coomaraswamy said last week.
