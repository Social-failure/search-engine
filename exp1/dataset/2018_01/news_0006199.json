The monitor said there were conflicting accounts, attributing the explosion that shook the Thalatheen district of the city to either a car bomb or a drone attack. \nAmbulances were deployed to the explosion site and rescue teams were continuing efforts to recover bodies and the injured from the rubble of the targeted building and neighboring houses, the monitor added. \nThe majority of the deaths were fighters from the rebel group, in addition to seven civilians, with several people still unaccounted for, it said. \nIdlib province is a stronghold of rebels in Syria and is situated on the border with Turkey, one of the main backers of rebellion against President Bashar al-Assad. \nThe Syrian army and its allies launched an offensive in October to recapture the provinces of Idlib and Hama, and it has since been making swift advances. \nThe main rebel force in Idlib is Tahrir al-Sham, spearheaded by the former al-Qaeda affiliate in Syria previously called Nusra Front. \nThe Syrian army lost Idlib to insurgents when the provincial capital fell in 2015. It became the only province fully under opposition control.
