(It‘s) not about union or not union. Forget about this ... I believe that the tennis improved a lot the last couple of years for the lower ranking players. \n”One sport is bigger not only when the top guys win a lot of money. It’s bigger when a sport creates a lot of jobs. \n”If there is 300 people living from tennis is better than if there is only 100. \n“But that’s my opinion. The real thing is if we can help at some point to the players that needs more help, will be fantastic.” \nTennis has been compared unfavourably with rival sports like soccer, golf and basketball in terms of the number of professionals able to make a living in the game and the overall share of wealth given to players. \nBut the Spaniard, who has earned $94,588,627 in prizemoney from the men’s professional ATP tour, suggested such comparisons were unhelpful. \n“You know what? The market is the market,” said the 31-year-old, who will play Bosnian 28th seed Damir Dzumhur for a place in the fourth round at Melbourne Park. \n”We cannot fight about the market. \n”Probably our sport is more global than football. \n”At the same time the sport is much bigger, football (more) than tennis, in terms of money, in terms of millions of fans. \n”But we cannot compare the sports. \n“We have to fight to make our sport better, bigger, and to have the best show possible for the crowd. Only like this we going to grow in all terms.” (Editing by Amlan Chakraborty)", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-17T12:53:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-17T13:33:43.006+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
