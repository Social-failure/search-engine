The Islamists exploit the grievances of Fulani cattle herders and their disputes with local farmers over access to grazing lands.\nPeriodic crackdowns on suspected jihadists have therefore tended to target the Fulani, driving some of them into the militants’ arms.\nReporting by Tiemoko Diallo; Writing by Tim Cocks; Editing by Mark Heinrich\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-25T16:56:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-25T17:06:55.023+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
