Addis Ababa says it will have no impact. \nSisi said negotiations with its two African neighbors were progressing and said a deadlock over a disputed, ongoing study on the dam’s impact must end. \n“The Nile basin enjoys great resources and capabilities that makes it a source of interconnection, building and development, not a source of conflict,” Sisi told reporters after meeting Ethiopia’s prime minister, Hailemariam Desalegn, in Cairo. \nHailemariam echoed his comments: “We must make sure that this great river never becomes an object of competition, mistrust or conflict.” Reporting by Mohamed El Sherif; Writing by Arwa Gaballa; Editing by John Davison and Alison Williams", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-18T16:39:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-18T16:54:19.016+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
