The new forecast mean 2019 revenues are now expected to be more than 2.2 billion euros, well above analyst expectations of 1.8 billion euros.\nThe Swiss-listed group supplies optical sensors that help adjust the brightness and colors on phone screens and can help with features like facial recognition.\nAMS is also working on environmental sensors which can detect gas particles or pollution levels, as well as health monitors which can be installed on mobile phones.\n“The substantial upward change... driven by a range of revenue pipeline opportunities in smartphone and consumer applications that are clearly coming into view,” AMS said.\nCredit Suisse analysts said they believe these opportunities may include front-end 3D sensing in future iPhone and iPad models as well as at some Chinese smartphone vendors.\nAMS said its revenue for 2017 nearly doubled to a record 1.06 billion euros ($1.32 billion).\n“The numbers and prospects for 2019 are likely to put investors in good mood and give a new momentum to the shares,” Vontobel analyst Michael Foeth said.\nZKB Research analysts upgrade their recommendation on the stock to “outperform” from “market perform”, saying 2019 outlook has been increased “considerably”.\nAMS shares rose 24.6 percent to 95.42 by 0834 GMT, having more than tripled in value last year as the launch of the tenth anniversary iPhone in September lifted expectations for demand.\nShares of its peer Dialog Semiconductor ( DLGS.DE ) jumped 7 percent, while STMicroelectronics ( STM.PA ) rose 3 percent.\n($1 = 0.8057 euros)\nReporting by Thyagaraju Adinarayan with additional reporting by Bartosz Dabrowski in Gdynia; Editing by Gopakumar Warrier and Alexander Smith\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-29T11:44:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-29T12:06:48.040+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
