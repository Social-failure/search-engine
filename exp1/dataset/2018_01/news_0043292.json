It did not discose details of the plan or that some of its bank accounts had been frozen. \nTianjin Tianhai, parent of U.S. technology hardware and services distributor Ingram Micro Inc, said the accounts had been frozen due to a disagreement between controlling shareholder HNA Technology and the Ningbo lender over the due date of a loan. Tianjin Tianhai said it had guaranteed the loan. \nReuters could not immediately reach Ningbo Commerce Bank for comment on Thursday. \nNearly half of Chinese conglomerate HNA’s listed units have suspended trade in their shares, ahead of an anticipated restructuring among group companies. HNA faces rising financing costs after a $50 billion acquisition spree over the past two years. \nOn Wednesday, HNA said it has passed compliance checks by several global banks, a rare bit of good news for the cash-strapped conglomerate. \nTianjin Tianhai, which bought Ingram Micro last year for about $6 billion, this month denied it was selling the subsidiary after media reports about a planned disposal. \nThe firm said it would look to strengthen its communication with its lenders in future to avoid similar situations happening again. \nWith its acquisition completed, Tianjin Tianhai expects its net profit in 2017 to increase by 123-172 percent from 321.51 million yuan ($51 million) from a year earlier due to the inclusion of Ingram Micro’s business, it said late on Thursday. $1 = 6.3196 Chinese yuan renminbi Reporting by Adam Jourdan; Additional reporting by Engen Tham and Matthew Miller; Editing by Edwina Gibbs and Adrian Croft", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-25T14:07:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-25T14:55:50.020+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
