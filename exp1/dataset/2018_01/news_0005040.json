REUTERS/Andres Stapff \nA five-times winner on two wheels, Despres took over at the top of the car classification from earlier starter Qatari Nasser al-Attiyah who had won Saturday’s short first timed stage from Lima. \nDespres ended the day with a 27-second lead over his compatriot, team mate and defending champion Stephane Peterhansel, who is chasing his 14th Dakar title. \nPeugeot finished one-two-three in the stage, with nine-times world rally champion Sebastian Loeb third after losing his brakes on Saturday. \nSouth African Giniel de Villiers was in third place overall for Toyota, however, five minutes 44 seconds behind Despres. \nToyota’s Al-Attiyah had the handicap of opening the 267-km stage, a loop around Pisco, with no motorcycle tracks for guidance this time and his French co-driver Matthieu Baumel feeling unwell in a stage requiring careful navigation.

If we start in a good position, it will be no problem, I think.” \nIn the motorcycle category, Britain’s defending champion Sam Sunderland lost the lead to Honda’s Spanish rider Joan Barreda and fell to fourth overall. \nBarreda leads French Yamaha rider Adrien van Beveren by two-and-a-half minutes. \nMonday’s 296-km third stage is south from Pisco to the coastal town of San Juan de Marcona.
