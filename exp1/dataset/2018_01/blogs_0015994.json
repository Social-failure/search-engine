Assets under management totaled $5.147 trillion at the end of 2016 and $5.98 trillion in the third quarter of last year.\nFull-year adjusted earnings got a 17 percent boost from the recent changes made to the U.S. tax code, the company said. Its net inflows, meanwhile, totaled a record $367 billion for last year.\n\"Our penetration with clients is deeper and broader,\" CEO Larry Fink said Friday on CNBC's \" Squawk Box .\" \"If we can work with clients in outcome investing, not momentary investing, and if we can provide them with a holistic review of all products, we're winning more clients.\"\nBlackRock's exchange-traded fund business saw $54.8 billion in net inflows during the fourth quarter, pushing iShares assets under management up to $1.752 trillion. The lion's share of the iShares net inflows came from equity ETFs, which saw inflows of $44.9 billion.\nThe asset manager also increased its quarterly dividend by 15 percent to $2.88 per share.\nBlackRock shares are off to a solid start for 2018. They are up 4.7 percent for the year thus far. The stock also had a strong performance last year. In 2017, BlackRock rose 35 percent.\nBut J.P. Morgan analyst Kenneth Worthington thinks the stock further upside. Last month, Worthington said he sees the company benefitting from \" higher fee rates and margins, driven by better non-US equity market returns .\" He also called BlackRock his top financials pick heading into 2018.\nDisclaimer", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-12T12:51:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-12T13:26:11.041+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
