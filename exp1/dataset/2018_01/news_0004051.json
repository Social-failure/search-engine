On February 4, 2016, Credit Suisse revealed a massive $633 million write-down from the sale of the bank's distressed debt and CLO positions, which would subsequently increase to nearly $1 billion. Credit Suisse's CEO admitted that traders took outsized illiquid positions in violation of the bank's risk policies because the bank was \"trying to generate revenue at all costs.\"\nCredit Suisse Shareholders Have Legal Options\nConcerned shareholders who would like more information about their rights and potential remedies can contact attorney Leonid Kandinov at (800) 350-6003, LKandinov@robbinsarroyo.com , or via the shareholder information form on the firm's website.\nRobbins Arroyo LLP is a nationally recognized leader in shareholder rights law.
