All the countries in the EU have not only seen a return to positive growth but are showing a marked acceleration in activity,” wrote Michael Carey, chief U.S. economist at Credit Agricole CIB, in a note. \n“The ECB has again signalled that, despite the improved growth prospects, the process of monetary normalisation will be slow, and it has managed to lock market expectations into its timetable.” \nBut for Britain, above-target inflation and a buoyant job market won’t push the Bank of England to tighten policy until at least November as it waits to see how divorce talks with the EU develop. \nThe U.S. economy was predicted to grow at its fastest pace in three years in 2018, fuelled by the biggest tax overhaul since the 1980s, but economists said the expected boost will be short-lived and will keep the Federal Reserve on track with its current guidance of three interest rate increases this year. \nOne conclusion from the latest surveys was inflation expectations, which showed the risk is now skewed more to the upside with last year’s pessimism somewhat tempered. TRADE PROTECTIONISM THREAT LIMITED \nWhile economists previously had repeatedly warned about “deep uncertainty” to the global economy from protectionist policies, particularly on U.S. President Donald Trump’s “America First” trade policies, the latest polls showed that was slowly fading. \nIndeed, over 80 percent of nearly 140 economists who answered a separate question said any significant barriers to global trade in 2018 were unlikely. \n“Global trade barriers are definitely a downside risk to our forecasts this year, but is not our baseline case. No country will benefit from erecting trade barriers, so we see such an outcome as still unlikely,” said Scott Anderson, chief economist at Bank of the West. \nBut the remaining 24 respondents said some barriers were likely to emerge. A few hurdles mentioned were the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) talks, Brexit negotiations and rising risks of a U.S. trade war with China. \nA majority of economists in a separate Reuters poll last week said NAFTA will probably be renegotiated successfully with no significant changes, despite the Trump administration’s saber-rattling. \n“I still suspect that adults will prevail and NAFTA will not be allowed to collapse,” said William Dickens, head of the economics department at Northeastern University in Boston. \nBut concerns over U.S. protectionism and a nationalist presidential candidate have weighed on the peso, stoking fears of faster inflation in Mexico. \nBarring that country, the latest poll showed economists’ confidence in Latin America’s growth prospects strengthening ahead of major elections in the region. \nExpectations of solid economic growth though was not widespread to other emerging market economies, with Turkey, India and China forecast to slow this year.
