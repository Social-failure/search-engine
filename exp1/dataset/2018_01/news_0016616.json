Tobias Harris scored 22 points on 10-for-14 shooting from the field.\n“Definitely a milestone night for me to have those type of numbers,” Drummond told a broadcast crew during his postgame interview. “Just went out there and played hard. That was really it.”\nDwight Buycks scored a career-high 17 points and rookie Luke Kennard and Avery Bradley added 13 points apiece for the Pistons (22-18), who snapped a five-game road losing streak.\n“In the previous games we played on the road, we allowed them to get us first, come out early and set a tone,” Drummond said. “I think we did a good job of really setting the tone early in that first quarter, really establishing ourselves, and kind of just rolling the rest of the way through.”\nAllen Crabbe paced the Nets (15-26) with 20 points. Rondae Hollis-Jefferson tossed in 15 points and Caris LeVert added 12 off the bench for Brooklyn.\nThe Pistons shot 51.6 percent from the field (48 of 93), while the Nets were held to 36.5 percent shooting (27 of 74).\nHarris got Detroit off to a good start with 14 first-quarter points. The Pistons took control for good late in that frame, once Pistons coach Stan Van Gundy went to his bench. A Kennard basket started a 29-7 run to put the Pistons on top 53-31 with 5:19 left in the half. Buycks supplied eight points during the outburst.\nFrom there, the game was never in doubt. Detroit led 63-41 at halftime with Drummond already piling up 18 points and 13 rebounds.\nBradley’s bucket with three minutes remaining in the third quarter pushed the lead to 30, 85-55. It moved to a 40-point spread at 104-64 with 8:20 left on a Kennard steal and dunk.\n--Field Level Media\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-01-11T11:27:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-11T12:33:18.013+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
