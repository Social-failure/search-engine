The United States has backed the YPG in its fight against Islamic State in Syria.\nReporting by Ece Toksabay and Tuvan Gumrukcu; Writing by David Dolan; editing by John Stonestreet\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-01-21T21:37:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-21T17:23:02.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
