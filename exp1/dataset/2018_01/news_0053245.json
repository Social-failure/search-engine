However, it would have to contend with a tough market, which has seen several planned London listings pulled in late 2017.\nCVC hired Rothschild after talking to a series of banks as part of a so-called beauty contest in October, sources said in November, to carry out preliminary work for the deal which included the selection of global coordinators and bookrunners. The sources said the company could be worth as much as $4 billion.\nAvast previously filed to go public on Nasdaq in December 2011 but the listing was pulled in July 2012 due to tough market conditions.\nAvast’s enterprise value has more than tripled in recent years following a series of bolt-on acquisitions including a $1.3 billion swoop on U.S. rival AVG Technologies in 2016 and the purchase of London-based optimization software firm Piriform in July for an undisclosed amount.\nChief Executive Vincent Steckler told Reuters in 2015 that the company was then worth “upwards of $2 billion”.\nEditing by David Evans\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-01-31T20:19:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-31T17:46:07.005+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
