If you have a strong belief you can do something, you can get there.”\nThe 22-year-old ended up winning at Hobart last year for her first WTA title and finished the season in the top 40.\nShe will face either fourth seed Elina Svitolina from Ukraine or Czech qualifier Denisa Allertova in the quarter-finals.\nReporting by Hardik Vyas in Bengaluru; editing by Sudipto Ganguly\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-21T11:06:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-21T11:22:03.010+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
