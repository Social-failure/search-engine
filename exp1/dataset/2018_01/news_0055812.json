He sped by defenseman Rasmus Ristolainen, zoomed from through the low slot and lifted a backhander by Lehner 5:49 into the second.\nIt was the Buffalo native’s 14th goal.\nThe Devils completed a pretty passing play to get a 2-0 lead on Hall’s team-leading 18th goal 5:31 into the third.\nJesper Bratt took a pass from Nico Hischier near the neutral zone and set it up with a no-look pass to Hall. Hall finished the play by driving an uncontested shot from the left faceoff circle that deflected off Lehner’s glove and into the net.\nIt also was Hall’s sixth goal in his last eight games, though he missed the last three games before the All-Star break with an injury.\nBuffalo halved the deficit on McCabe’s shot through traffic from the left faceoff circle, but Kinkaid made key stops on Ristolainen and Ryan O‘Reilly in the final minute when Buffalo pulled Lehner for the extra attacker.\nPalmieri finished it off when he stripped defenseman Marco Scandella and fired into the empty net with 5.9 seconds left.\n--Field Level Media\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-01-31T11:06:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-31T16:20:42.003+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
