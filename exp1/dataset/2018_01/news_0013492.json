I‘m trying to do my best on court and win as many matches before going to Melbourne. \n“It’s just the beginning of the year. I‘m trying to play my game again, enjoy every minute on court. I‘m trying to be aggressive and play like I did the year before last.” \nThe other semi-final in Sydney will be an all-Australian affair between Ashleigh Barty and Daria Gavrilova. \nBarty completed a confident 6-3 6-2 victory over Czech Barbora Strycova, while Gavrilova advanced after her last-eight opponent Garbine Muguruza withdrew due to a leg injury. \n“I think it’s amazing for Sydney and for Australian tennis – we’re gonna have an Aussie in the final, which is awesome,” Barty said after her win at the Ken Rosewall Arena. \n“Dash and I know each other very well so hopefully we can play some good tennis.” Reporting by Sudipto Ganguly in Mumbai; editing by Pritha Sarkar", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-11T14:18:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-11T14:32:02.004+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
