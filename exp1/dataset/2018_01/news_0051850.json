The integration brings tremendous growth opportunities for the dedicated workforce who make up the DNA of the success of both of our companies.”\n“By bringing StateServ and Hospicelink together, we are building on the strengths of each company to create a single, leading DME company that leverages best practices to support complex solutions for end of life care,” said Jeremy Kogler, Principal at Blue Wolf . “Both companies have created market-leading technology solutions for hospice care; the new combined company will rise to meet the growing demand of our aging population.”\n“The StateServ and Hospicelink integration builds upon the recent investment by Blue Wolf– both companies have valuable, long-standing relationships with their customers who rely on their innovative, quality service to ensure the well-being of their patients,” added Adam Blumenthal, Managing Partner of Blue Wolf . “The strategic combination creates an undisputed market leader for DME and benefit management platforms available today.

For more information, please visit www.stateserv.com .\nAbout Hospicelink\nHospicelink was founded in 2011 by a team of DME, hospice, and technology veterans who believed there were better ways to manage DME spend while enhancing patient care. Hospicelink has created a nationally recognized, award winning technology and service organization specifically designed to enhance and foster the unique relationship between hospice companies and DME providers. Historically, DME ordering and management was characterized by a lack of transparency and accountability between hospices and DME providers – orders were faxed or called into the DME, invoices were inaccurate and late, costs were unmanaged and difficult to control, and larger hospices were having to manage multiple DME providers across the nation. As a result, Hospicelink has the unique ability to serve as an advocate for both hospice and DME clients. Hospicelink enables a healthy, symbiotic relationship between hospices and DME providers to ensure the highest quality patient care at the best possible price.
