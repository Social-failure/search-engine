This is our internal competence guaranteed by EU law,” he said. \nKaczynski, who holds no official government post, became the country’s de-facto leader after PiS won elections in late 2015. \nPoland’s new prime minister, Mateusz Morawiecki, said earlier this month the country’s dispute with the European Commission was just a “misunderstanding” and that dialogue was needed. \nThe invocation of article 7 is a major political embarrassment for Poland, but the EU is unlikely to impose the ultimate sanction of suspending Poland’s voting rights because its ally Hungary has vowed to veto any such move.
