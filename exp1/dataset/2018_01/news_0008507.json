While Phuc singled out the South China Sea, he made no mention of China. \n“To protect the country in the new situation, the Communist Party has set a high priority on protection of the State in cyberspace,” the website quoted Phuc as saying at the foundation ceremony for the new unit. \nIn December, Vietnam revealed it had a cyber warfare unit of 10,000 staff, named Force 47, to counter what it said were ‘wrong’ views on the Internet, local media reported. \nThe government has also called for closer watch over social media networks and sought the removal of content that it deemed offensive, but there has been little sign of it silencing criticism aired on global platforms. \nIn August, Vietnam’s president said the country needed to pay greater attention to controlling “news sites and blogs with bad and dangerous content”, amid a crackdown on critics of the one-party state.
