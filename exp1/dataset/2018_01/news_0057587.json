REUTERS/Jonathan Ernst McKinsey & Company researchers say that $150 billion a year will be required between now and 2030, or about $1.8 trillion in total, to fix all the country’s infrastructure needs.\nThe American Society of Civil Engineers, a lobbying group with an interest in infrastructure spending, puts it at $2 trillion over 10 years.\nTrump said any infrastructure bill needed to cut the regulation and approval process that he said delayed the building of bridges, highways and other infrastructure. He wants the approval process reduced to two years, “and perhaps even one.”\nCutting regulation is a top priority of business lobbying groups with a stake in building projects and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce.\nReporting by Damon Darlin; Editing by Peter Cooney\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-31T05:32:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-31T05:42:07.007+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
