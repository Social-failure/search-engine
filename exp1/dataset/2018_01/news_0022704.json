The World Bank’s figures are 3.0 percent and 3.2 percent, respectively.\nThe IMF, EU and other international lenders froze aid for Bosnia last year after agreed economic reforms were interrupted by internal political bickering and ethnic tensions.\nSenad Softic, Governor of the Bosnia and Herzegovina Central Bank, poses for a photo after the interview for Reuters in his office in Sarajevo, Bosnia and Herzegovina December 20, 2016. REUTERS/Dado Ruvic In December, parliament passed a long-delayed law on raising road tolls and excise taxes on biofuel, paving the way for unlocking about 1 billion euros ($1.23 billion) of international loans intended primarily for infrastructure projects.\nSoftic said he expected direct foreign investment to have reached 700 million Bosnian marka ($435 million) in 2017, up about 45 percent from the previous year.\nDevelopments this year would however depend on how the reform program fared, the pace of economic recovery in the euro zone - Bosnia’s key trade partner - and trends on global markets.\n“It is essential to direct resources in the economic development of the country, the process of European integration and reforms,” said Softic. “But this is an election year and the focus may rather be on political than on economic issues.”\nPolitical campaigning has already started for parliamentary and presidential elections that will be held in October.\nSoftic said Bosnia’s banking sector was stable and liquid, with a 6.6 percent annual rise of new loans up to October 2017, while the rate of bad loans was down to 10.8 percent in the third quarter of 2017 from 12.1 percent in 2016.\nReporting by Daria Sito-Sucic; Editing by John Stonestreet, William Maclean\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-01-16T00:29:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-16T13:29:03.007+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
