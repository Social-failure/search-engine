REUTERS/Rory Carroll While delighted at that team’s performances in Japan and South Korea, that was also something he left in the past.\n“It’s not like I dwell on that experience either,” he said. “But that’s an experience I’ll never forget, and I’ll never forget this one either.”\nDefender Walker Zimmerman also added there was no need to completely overhaul the national team and its systems, as some fans have suggested as they build towards Qatar.\n“I don’t think we’re blowing anything up,” he said.\n”There’s a lot of motivation to make sure that this doesn’t happen again.\n“We can become a team that sticks together and we approach 2022 from this day right here.”\n(The story was refiled to correct place in the second paragraph)\nEditing by Greg Stutchbury\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-12T03:29:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-12T03:39:38.036+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
