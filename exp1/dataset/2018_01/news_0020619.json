May last year accused Moscow of military aggression and in December, Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson said there was abundant evidence of Russia meddling in foreign elections. \nThe Kremlin, which under Vladimir Putin has clawed back some of the global influence lost when the Soviet Union collapsed, has denied meddling in elections in the West. It says anti-Russian hysteria is sweeping through the United States and Europe. \n“We will take the necessary actions to counter Russian activity,” May said in a speech at the Guildhall in London’s financial district on Nov. 13. \nThe Russian embassy said May was speaking about vigilance without dealing with the real threats, which it didn’t specify. \n“This imitation game, in the pattern of PM Theresa May’s speech ... is about showing off vigilance rather than dealing with real threats,” the embassy spokesman said. \nEarlier this month, a British frigate escorted Russian ships near UK territorial waters following a similar deployment over the Christmas period and Britain regularly scrambles fighters to intercept Russian aircraft near its airspace.
