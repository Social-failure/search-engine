In comparison, shares of Diamondback, a pure play on the lucrative Permian, only sank 40 percent.\nNow at 130 a share, Diamondback is trading far above where it was when crude oil prices were at $100, even though they were only at $66.11 as of Friday's close, Cramer noted.\n\"You might think that's patently insane, but the truth is that Diamondback hasn't been sitting still for these past few years,\" the \"Mad Money\" host said.\n\"If you only learn one thing about Diamondback Energy tonight, learn this: with oil prices once again on the rise, this company's earnings are poised to explode higher,\" he added.\nOver the years, Diamondback has taken advantage of oil's boom-and-bust cycle. During the latest bust, the company raised cash via secondary stock offerings, then spent $3.5 billion to buy more acreage in the Permian and acquire Brigham Energy.\n\"Thanks in part to these deals, Diamondback's production is now 18 times greater than when the company came public a little over five years ago,\" Cramer said.\nNow that oil prices are climbing, virtually all of Diamondback's acreage is profitable. As such, the company is ramping up its rig count and boosting production, driving bottom-line growth.\nAnd the company is beloved on Wall Street because it is easy to understand, Cramer said. \"One of the simplest oil and gas exploration plays on earth,\" it only operates in six key areas of one region — the Permian — in stark contrast to its cross-continental, multinational competitors, he said.\nBetter yet, the company has the lowest cash costs and, therefore, the highest cash margins than any other Permian-based operator. Best of all, its stock is still cheap, trading at only 19 times 2018 earnings estimates despite its 63 percent long-term growth rate, Cramer said.\nCompared to Apache and EOG Resources ' 40 times price-to-earnings multiples, Diamondback's stock remains a bargain vis-a-vis its rivals, the \"Mad Money\" host said.\n\"The bottom line? Sometimes the stock market actually makes some sense. Diamondback Energy has caught fire because it makes a killing from higher oil prices, and as long as crude stays in the $60s, this company will be in great shape,\" Cramer concluded. \"It's not for everybody. This is a wild one. But if you want to bet on a strong oil market, there's only one company worth doing it with and that's Diamondback.\"\nWATCH: Cramer's bull case for the market's other FANG show chapters Cramer says the market's other FANG is a great growth play on oil 20 Hours Ago | 09:35 Disclosure: Cramer's charitable trust owns shares of Apache.\nQuestions for Cramer?\nCall Cramer: 1-800-743-CNBC\nWant to take a deep dive into Cramer's world?
