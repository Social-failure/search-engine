When you see that (a share price rise) it does increase the short position, but there is no known reason that we are aware of and it’s business as usual from our point of view,” the firm’s head of investor relations Chris Meadows told Reuters. APPLE ORDERS \nApple uses epi-wafers to power iPhone X features like Face ID and Animoji, and in its AirPod headphones. \nIn December, it made a $390 million investment in Texas-based Finisar, which plans to supply the company with similar materials to IQE. \nA number of Taiwanese companies are also manufacturing epi-wafers, with HLJ Technology’s shares doubling since December, when it was reported by industry publication Digitimes that the company would supply Apple. \n“Seeing more competitors shows it is a market that is expected to grow quite significantly,” Meadows said. “We are pretty confident we have a significant lead technology-wise.” \nHedge funds also point to two joint ventures that IQE runs with universities in Wales and Singapore that make losses but are not recognised on IQE’s own income statement. \nIQE said it expected these ventures to eventually be profitable, and that they formed part of a long-term plan of developing new technologies in partnership with universities. \nThe fund with the largest disclosed short position in IQE is Marshall Wace, which was among those that made hundreds of millions of pounds betting against British construction and outsourcing company Carillion before its collapse. \nIt was also short Imagination Technologies, an Apple supplier whose share price plunged in April after Apple announced it was cutting the company out of its supply chain. \nThe other six funds with disclosed short positions are Coltrane Asset Management, Ennismore Fund Management, Millennium International Management, Quentec Asset Management, Valiant Capital Management and WorldQuant. $1 = 0.7069 pounds Editing by Tom Pfeiffer and Mark Potter", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-30T17:08:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-30T17:34:45.008+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
