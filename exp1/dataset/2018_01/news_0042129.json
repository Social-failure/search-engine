(Nasdaq:LOB) (“Live Oak” or “the Company”) today reported fourth quarter net earnings available to common shareholders of $71.7 million, or $1.74 per diluted share, compared to $5.5 million, or $0.16 per diluted share, of 2016. The fourth quarter of 2017 included a pretax gain of $68.0 million related to an equity method investment in Apiture, LLC (\"Apiture\"), an $18.9 million revaluation of the Company's net deferred tax liability, and several other smaller non-routine costs. Net earnings for the year ended December 31, 2017 totaled $100.5 million, or $2.65 per diluted share, compared to $13.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, or $0.39 per diluted share.\n“2017 was a phenomenal year for Live Oak in many ways. We enjoyed record earnings per share of $2.65 while experiencing terrific growth in recurring revenue sources that exceeded $100 million. We continued our mission to serve small businesses with record setting loan originations in excess of $1.9 billion while steadily expanding the roster of industry sectors we focus on. Specific to the fourth quarter of 2017, we closed our joint venture with First Data Corporation to create Apiture as part of our desire to fundamentally change an industry through open application program technology on next-generation digital banking platforms. We also conducted a highly successful capital raise this past year while recent changes in the tax code further bolstered our capital account, affording us additional opportunities to invest in our growth, our employees, our customers, and our community,” said James S. Mahan, III, Chief Executive Officer of Live Oak.\nYear over Year Highlights\n(Dollars in thousands, except per share data) Increase (Decrease) 2017 2016 Dollars Percent Net interest income and servicing revenues $ 102,622 $ 64,042 $ 38,580 60 % Net income attributable to Live Oak Bancshares, Inc. 100,499 13,773 86,726 630 Diluted earnings per share 2.65 0.39 2.26 579 Non-GAAP net income (1) 47,187 20,148 27,039 134 Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share (1) 1.25 0.57 0.68 119 Loan and lease production: Loans and leases originated $ 1,934,238 $ 1,537,010 $ 397,228 26 % % Fully funded 50.9 % 48.2 % n/a n/a Loan sales: Guaranteed loans sold $ 787,926 $ 761,933 $ 25,993 3 % Net gains on sales of guaranteed loans 79,090 75,326 3,764 5 Average net gain on sale of guaranteed loans, per million sold 100.38 98.86 1.52 2 (1) See accompanying GAAP to Non-GAAP Reconciliation.\nFourth Quarter 2017 Key Measures\n(Dollars in thousands, except per share data) Increase (Decrease) Q4 2017 Q4 2016 Dollars Percent Q3 2017 Net interest income and servicing revenues $ 28,977 $ 18,060 $ 10,917 60 % $ 27,515 Net income attributable to Live Oak Bancshares, Inc. 71,730 5,480 66,250 1,209 12,862 Diluted earnings per share 1.74 0.16 1.58 988 0.33 Non-GAAP net income (1) 16,875 6,076 10,799 178 13,312 Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share (1) 0.41 0.17 0.24 141 0.34 Loan and lease production: Loans and leases originated $ 483,422 $ 514,565 $ (31,143 ) (6 )% $ 395,682 % Fully funded 42.9 % 48.0 % n/a n/a 37.4 % Loan sales: Guaranteed loans sold $ 211,654 $ 260,125 $ (48,471 ) (19 )% $ 163,843 Net gains on sales of guaranteed loans 23,314 22,513 801 4 18,148 Average net gain on sale of guaranteed loans, per million sold 110.15 86.55 23.6 27 110.76 (1) See accompanying GAAP to Non-GAAP Reconciliation.\nLoans and Leases\nAt December 31, 2017, the total loan and lease portfolio of $2.02 billion increased 55.5% above its level of a year ago and 8.7% from September 30, 2017. Net loans and leases held for investment increased $170.9 million, or 14.9%, to $1.32 billion at December 31, 2017, from $1.15 billion at September 30, 2017. Loans held for sale decreased $12.1 million, or 1.8%, to $680.5 million at December 31, 2017, from $692.6 million at September 30, 2017. Loan and lease originations totaled $483.4 million during the fourth quarter of 2017, an increase of $87.7 million, or 22.2%, from the third quarter of 2017. Originations for year ended December 31, 2017 rose by 25.8% to $1.93 billion compared to $1.54 billion for the year ended December 31, 2016. The total loan and lease portfolio at December 31, 2017, and September 30, 2017, of $2.02 billion and $1.86 billion, respectively, were comprised of approximately 61.4% and 60.6% of unguaranteed loans and leases, respectively.\nAverage loans and leases were $1.91 billion during the fourth quarter of 2017 compared to $1.77 billion during the third quarter of 2017.\nNet Interest Income\nNet interest income of 2017 increased to $23.0 million compared to $12.4 million of 2016. The increase was driven by the significant growth in the combined held for sale and held for investment loan and lease portfolios and reflected the Company's initiative to grow recurring revenue sources by increasing the level of loans and leases retained on the balance sheet. The net interest margin of 4.07% of 2017 increased from 3.91% for the third quarter of 2017. The net interest margin has risen by 99 basis points from the fourth quarter of 2016 as the Company has benefited from the repricing characteristics of its loan portfolio in the rising interest rate environment.\nNoninterest Income\nNoninterest income of 2017 totaled $95.4 million, compared to $26.3 million of 2016. The increase was driven by a $68.0 million gain arising from the Company’s equity method investment in Apiture. Excluding this one-time gain, noninterest income totaled $27.4 million of 2017, a $1.1 million increase over the fourth quarter of 2016.\nNet gains on sales of loans increased to $23.3 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 compared to $22.5 million in the fourth quarter of 2016 and $18.1 million for the third quarter of 2017. The volume of guaranteed loans sold in the fourth quarter of 2017 totaled $211.7 million compared to $163.8 million in the third quarter of 2017 and $260.1 million in the fourth quarter of 2016. The decline in the volume of guaranteed loans sold compared to fourth quarter of 2016 was countered by a significant increase in the average net gain on sale at $110.2 thousand per million sold of 2017 compared to $86.6 thousand per million sold of 2016.\nLoan servicing revenues of $6.0 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 increased by $333 thousand from the fourth quarter of 2016. The net loss resulting from the servicing asset revaluation totaled $6.3 million of 2017, an increase of $3.0 million compared to the fourth quarter of 2016.\nThe inclusion of Reltco, Inc. and National Assurance Title, Inc. (collectively referred to as \"Reltco\"), which were acquired in February 2017, contributed $1.8 million in noninterest income to the Company in the fourth quarter of 2017, a decline of $206 thousand compared to the third quarter of 2017.\nNoninterest Expense\nNoninterest expense of 2017 was $41.0 million compared to $32.4 million of 2016 and $35.9 million for the third quarter of 2017. Noninterest expense of 2017 included costs associated with several non-routine events in the quarter. The Company incurred expenses of $1.7 million of merger and acquisition related costs, $3.6 million due to the impairment of intangible assets associated with the acquisition of Reltco, $1.6 million due to contract modification for the continued operation of Reltco, $690 thousand for the impairment of a tax credit investment from the fourth quarter of 2016, and $360 thousand of stock based compensation expense related to restricted stock awards with an effective grant date of May 24, 2016, for key employee retention. The resulting noninterest expense adjusted for these non-routine items totaled $33.0 million in the fourth quarter of 2017, a decline from third quarter of 2017. See the accompanying GAAP to Non-GAAP Reconciliation for further information relative to non-routine items.\nSalaries and employee benefits of 2017 increased to $19.0 million compared to $17.1 million of 2016. Included in these totals, total stock based compensation expense in the fourth quarter of 2017 was $1.8 million compared to $4.4 million of 2016. This decline was offset by the ongoing expansion of the Company’s business platform, workforce and related infrastructure to support its growth strategy along with the addition of Reltco personnel during the first quarter of 2017.\nCompared to the fourth quarter of 2016, there were increases in data processing expense of $1.5 million and equipment expense of $1.9 million of 2017. The increase in data processing arose from the ongoing efforts of the Company to expand its technological competitive advantage and from the contribution of software development resources to Apiture. The latter move transferred the recognition of costs associated with the Company’s technology development from salaries and employee benefits to data processing. The increase in equipment expense reflected the higher levels of depreciation related to aircraft acquired in the first quarter of 2017 and solar panels acquired for the Company’s renewable energy leasing business.\nAsset Quality\nThe unguaranteed exposure of nonperforming loans increased slightly to $3.6 million at December 31, 2017, compared to $3.3 million at September 30, 2017. Total unguaranteed nonperforming loans as a percentage of total loans and leases held for investment declined to 0.27% at December 31, 2017, compared to 0.28% at September 30, 2017. Total nonperforming loans increased slightly to $23.5 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 from $22.4 million at the end of the prior quarter.\nThe unguaranteed exposure of foreclosed assets decreased to $90 thousand at December 31, 2017, from $446 thousand at September 30, 2017. Foreclosed assets decreased $950 thousand to $1.3 million at December 31, 2017, from $2.2 million at September 30, 2017.\nNet charge-offs amounted to $892 thousand in the fourth quarter of 2017 compared to $959 thousand in the third quarter of 2017 and $813 thousand in the fourth quarter of 2016. Net charge-offs as a percentage of average held for investment loans and leases, annualized, for the quarters ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 were 0.28% and 0.39%, respectively. Net charge-offs for the twelve months of 2017 totaled $3.6 million compared to $1.7 million for the twelve months of 2016.\nProvision for Loan and Lease Losses\nThe provision for loan and lease losses of 2017 totaled $4.1 million compared to $2.4 million for the third quarter of 2017 and $3.8 million of 2016. The fourth quarter of 2017 provision exceeded net charge-offs by $3.2 million, thus adding to loan and lease loss reserves in consideration of the continued growth of the loan and lease portfolio.\nThe allowance for loan and lease losses totaled $24.2 million at December 31, 2017, compared to $21.0 million at September 30, 2017. The allowance for loan and lease losses as a percentage of total loans and leases held for investment was 1.80% at December 31, 2017 and September 30, 2017, respectively.\nIncome Tax\nIncome tax expense in the fourth quarter of 2017 totaled $1.6 million compared to a net income tax benefit of $3.0 million in the fourth quarter of 2016 and a benefit of $5.1 million in the third quarter of 2017. For the year ended December 31, 2017, there was a net income tax benefit of $2.2 million. This benefit was primarily driven by the Company’s leasing of renewable energy assets which generated $24.9 million in investment tax credits along with an estimated revaluation of the Company’s net deferred tax liability totaling $18.9 million as a result of the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act in the fourth quarter of 2017.\nDeposits\nTotal deposits increased by $247.4 million, or 12.3%, to $2.26 billion at December 31, 2017, compared to $2.01 billion at September 30, 2017, following successful deposit gathering campaigns. Average total interest-bearing deposits of 2017 increased $65.9 million, or 3.4%, to $2.01 billion, compared to $1.94 billion for the third quarter of 2017. The ratio of average total loans and leases to average interest-bearing deposits was 95.0% of 2017, compared to 91.1% for the third quarter of 2017.\nConference Call\nLive Oak will host a conference call to discuss quarterly results at 9:00 a.m. ET tomorrow morning (January 25, 2018).

measures previously shown. The adjustments to reconcile from the applicable GAAP financial measure to the non-GAAP financial measures are included where applicable in financial results presented in accordance with GAAP. The Company considers these adjustments to be relevant to ongoing operating results. The Company believes that excluding the amounts associated with these adjustments to present the non-GAAP financial measures provides a meaningful base for period-to-period comparisons, which will assist regulators, investors, and analysts in analyzing the operating results or financial position of the Company. The non-GAAP financial measures are used by management to assess the performance of the Company’s business for presentations of Company performance to investors, and for other reasons as may be requested by investors and analysts. The Company further believes that presenting the non-GAAP financial measures will permit investors and analysts to assess the performance of the Company on the same basis as that applied by management. Non-GAAP financial measures have inherent limitations, are not required to be uniformly applied, and are not audited. Although non-GAAP financial measures are frequently used by shareholders to evaluate a company, they have limitations as an analytical tool and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of results reported under GAAP.\nSource:Live Oak Bancshares, Inc.", "external_links": ["https://www.globenewswire.com/NewsRoom/AttachmentNg/b28d92b3-52b9-4c9c-8572-7a0967b32818"], "published": "2018-01-25T00:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-25T01:49:23.010+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
