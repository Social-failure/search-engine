(NYSE: QTM) today announced that its board of directors has appointed Patrick Dennis as president and CEO, effective today. Dennis was most recently president and CEO of Guidance Software and has also held senior executive roles in strategy, operations, sales, services and engineering at EMC. He succeeds Adalio Sanchez, a member of Quantum's board who had served as interim CEO since early November 2017. Sanchez will remain on the board and assist with the transition.\n\"Patrick has been a successful public company CEO and brings a broad range of experience in storage and software, including a proven track record leading business transformations,\" said Raghu Rau, Quantum's chairman. \"The other board members and I look forward to working closely with him to drive growth, cost reductions, and profitability and deliver long-term shareholder value. We also want to thank Adalio for stepping in and leading the company during a critical transition period.\"\n\"During my time as CEO, I've greatly appreciated the commitment to change I've seen from team members across Quantum and will be supporting Patrick in any way I can to build on the important work we started,\" said Sanchez.\nDennis served as president and CEO of Guidance Software, a provider of cyber security software solutions, from May 2015 until its acquisition by OpenText last September.
