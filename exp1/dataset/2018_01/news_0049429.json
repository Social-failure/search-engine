Their average pension funding gap, future obligations versus current investments, has remained wide despite the run-up in stock prices.\nRetirement plans may need to add $16 billion in fixed income and to reduce up to $20 billion in equities for their month-end asset-allocation rebalancing, they wrote in a research note.\nCorporate pensions could pocket some gains from Wall Street’s blistering start to 2018 with the S&P 500 gaining 7 percent in January. They could put the money in less risky Treasuries.\n“The $15-20 billion asset allocation shift is quite sizable in the context of recent experience,” the Wells Fargo strategists wrote. “The size of the January shift is a testament to the large gap in performance between equities and Treasuries at the start of 2018.”\nReporting by Richard Leong; Editing by David Gregorio\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-29T18:16:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-29T18:31:31.021+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
