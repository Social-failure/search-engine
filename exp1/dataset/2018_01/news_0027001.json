REUTERS/Kevin Lamarque \nMany Democrats have said they will not vote for the bill without an immigration deal, and Republicans will need at least some Democratic votes to pass the funding extension in the Senate. \nTrump said he thinks a deal on immigration is still possible. “Time is running out,” he said. \nTrump also said a federal government shutdown “could happen” by the end of the week, insisting that Democrats would be blamed if that happened. Trump did not rule out signing a short-term spending measure by a Friday deadline to prevent a shutdown.
