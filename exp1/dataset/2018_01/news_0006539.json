Criminologists and police officials say the increase in murders in 2015 and 2016 was driven by drug-related violence and a breakdown in police-community relations following the high-profile police shootings of black men. \nBy Zusha Elinson Zolan Kanno-Youngs \nMurders fell in America’s largest cities in 2017, and the two biggest—New York and Los Angeles—are at or near the lowest levels of deadly violence in their modern histories. \nIn New York, murders dropped to 290, a number not seen since 1951, police say, and killings in Los Angeles were at 281, staying below 300 for the eighth consecutive year, according to data from the police and the Federal Bureau of Investigation. Even Chicago, where ragged violence has shocked the nation, saw murders fall to 650 in 2017, down from 771 in 2016, police say. \nSeven of the 10 largest U.S. cities saw declines 2017, according to police; one saw an increase, and two didn’t have final data. There are striking exceptions, with Baltimore and Philadelphia both seeing increases in murder in 2017. \nPolice in New York and Los Angeles say they have brought down murders with a more surgical approach than in the past. Algorithms that map and predict crime are now used to deploy officers to hot spots. Police also zero in on the most violent offenders. At the same time, they also have focused on building relationships with residents. \nThe trend follows a two-year uptick in homicides and a broader nationwide decline in crime from the 1990s to the early 2010s. The causes remain debated, with theories including police tactics, aging populations, the economy, the collapse of the 1990s crack market and incarceration rates in the 1990s.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-05T17:25:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-05T17:34:49.033+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
