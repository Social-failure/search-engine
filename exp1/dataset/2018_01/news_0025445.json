It monitors countriesâ€™ commitments to abide by EU standards on tax matters.\nIf the recommendation were confirmed by EU ministers, the eight jurisdictions will be moved to a so-called gray list which includes those who have committed to change their rules on tax transparency and cooperation. The gray list currently includes 47 jurisdictions.\nThe shrinking of the blacklist is likely to be criticized by tax transparency groups. In December some activists denounced the listing process as a whitewash and had called for the inclusion in the blacklist of some EU countries accused of facilitating tax avoidance, like Luxembourg, Malta, Ireland and the Netherlands.\nThe recommended removal of Panama may cause particular outcry, as it has been at the center of one of the largest disclosures of offshore schemes, the so-called Panama Papers.\nEU officials have said the purpose of the blacklist is to convince jurisdictions to become more transparent. Having fewer on the list means more countries have committed to changes, they say.\nReporting by Francesco Guarascio; Editing by Gabriela Baczynska and Andrew Roche\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-15T17:45:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-15T18:17:56.023+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
