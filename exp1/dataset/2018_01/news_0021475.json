When Hornung said she couldn’t cover up further because it would upset her daughter, she says the owner “started harping about the children and men who can see my indecency” and then asked her and her husband to leave. \nNorth Dakota law allows women to breastfeed freely in both private and public locations. \nHornung recounted the story on her Facebook page. The franchise owner later apologized for how she handled the incident.
