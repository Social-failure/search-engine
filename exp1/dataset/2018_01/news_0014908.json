There is still an opportunity for us to select Petter,” national team chief Vidar Lofshus said in a statement.\nNorthug’s coach, Stig Rune Kveen, does not share that optimism.\n“We feel the Olympics is gone now,” Kveen told reporters, adding that Northug has been advised by his doctors to take it easy for a few more days.\n“I’ve seen that the team management has said he could be added at their discretion, but I don’t think that’s likely,” the coach said.\nOne of Norway’s best-known and most popular athletes, 32-year-old Northug won two golds, a silver and a bronze medal at the Vancouver Olympics in 2010, adding two team bronze medals four years later in Sochi.\nReporting by Philip O'Connor; Editing by David Goodman\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-17T15:47:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-17T16:06:56.015+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
