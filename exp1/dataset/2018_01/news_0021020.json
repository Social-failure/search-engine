Dumba took a slick between-the-legs pass from Marcus Foligno to score his first goal and added the second for some insurance later in the period.\nWild goalie Devan Dubnak earned the victory with 32 saves as Minnesota held a 41-33 edge in shots\nFoligno and Charlie Coyle each added two assists.\nMinnesota controlled play throughout much of the first two periods. The Wild had three power plays in that first period and four in the first two, finding a number of scoring chances.\nGranlund helped with each of the first two goals. He scored the initial goal by redirecting a Ryan Suter shot past goalie Connor Hellebuyck 8:47 into the game.\nGranlund got good position right in front of the goalie and tipped Suter’s shot from near the right point past Hellebuyck for the power-play goal.\nThe Wild took advantage of a fortunate bounce for its second goal. Granlund fired a puck toward the goal from the right side and it went wide. However, the puck bounced off the end boards and came right to Jason Zucker for the easy tap-in and a 2-0 lead 5:40 into the second period.\nThat was the first time Zucker has scored a goal with a goalie in the cage in 17 games, His only other score during that stretch came on an empty-netter.\n-- Field Level Media\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-01-14T11:12:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-14T20:26:26.003+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
