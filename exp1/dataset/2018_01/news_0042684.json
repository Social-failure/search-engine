Therefore, we will try to reduce the damage of users through more strict sanctions,” said KCC chair Lee Hyo-Sung (according to an automated translation of the regulator’s statement). \nAlthough these fines are unlikely to be an existential issue for South Korea’s cryptocurrency exchanges, they do come in the context of wider uncertainty in the country’s virtual coin space. \nRumblings from the government about shuttering exchanges have been responsible for serious drops in the value of bitcoin over recent weeks. \nThe most recent spot of nervousness came from South Korea’s Financial Services Commission (FSC) announcing the deadline beyond which investors will need to use their real names if they want to trade in bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. That date is January 30. \nStill, although this news temporarily knocked bitcoin below $10,000 (it’s back up to $11,150 right now), the move does suggest that cryptocurrency trading has a future in South Korea—as long as exchanges stick to certain rules.
