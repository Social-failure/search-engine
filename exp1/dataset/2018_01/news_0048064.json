Economists polled by Reuters had forecast the economy to expand at a 3 percent rate. \n“The Q4 print showed that domestic demand is strong – really strong – and perhaps beginning to push against the capacity constraints of the economy,” market economists at BNP Paribas wrote in a note. \nAnother set of data showed new orders for key U.S.-made capital goods unexpectedly fell in December. \nMarkets have moved this week on comments from top U.S. officials at the World Economic Forum in Davos. \nU.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin’s endorsement of a weak dollar earlier in the week had triggered a slide in the currency. It recouped some of the losses after President Donald Trump said he ultimately wants the dollar to be strong. \nThe dollar was last down 0.46 percent against a basket of currencies .DXY. \nAt 12:29 p.m. ET (1729 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJI rose 93.42 points, or 0.35 percent, at 26,486.21. The S&P 500 .SPX gained 15.76 points, or 0.56 percent, to 2,855.01. The Nasdaq Composite .IXIC was up 45.65 points, or 0.62 percent, at 7,456.81. \nOf the 133 S&P 500 companies that have reported quarterly earnings so far, 79.7 percent have topped expectations, versus an average of 72 percent over the previous four quarters. \nThe S&P healthcare index .SPXHC was the biggest gainer among the 11 major S&P sectors, up 1.3 percent, led by gains in AbbVie, Pfizer and Gilead. \nPfizer ( PFE.N ) rose 3.6 percent after European regulator recommended granting marketing approval to a diabetes drug developed by the company and Merck ( MRK.N ). \nGilead Sciences ( GILD.O ) jumped 4.4 percent after broker upgraded to “buy”. \nHoneywell International ( HON.N ) rose 1.05 percent after the company raised its forecast for 2018 profit. \nStarbucks ( SBUX.O ) fell 5.8 percent after it warned 2018 global cafe sales growth would be at the low end of its forecast. The stock was the biggest drag on the Nasdaq. \nDeclining issues outnumbered advancers on the NYSE by 1,420 to 1,413. On the Nasdaq, 1,451 issues rose and 1,403 fell.
