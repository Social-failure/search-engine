Proctor also did not immediately provide the cause of death. \n“I can confirm that Mark Salling passed away early this morning,” Proctor said in a statement. \nPolice and the Los Angeles County coroner’s office confirmed that a body had been found in Los Angeles but would not immediately identify it. \nSalling was arrested in 2015 after he showed child pornography on his computer to a girlfriend and she reported it to police, according to the U.S. Department of Justice. \nSalling pleaded guilty on Dec. 18 to a federal charge of possessing child pornography, admitting he had downloaded 25,000 sexual images of children onto his computer from the Internet. \nHe was allowed to remain free as his case was heard, and was scheduled to appear in court on March 7 for sentencing. \nSalling faced a sentence of between four to seven years in prison under the plea agreement he reached with prosecutors, the Justice Department said in December. \nFrom 2009 to 2015, Salling appeared in “Glee,” an award-winning show on Fox. He played Puck, a bully and a football player who showed a softer side when he joined the glee club at his high school. \n“Mark was a gentle and loving person, a person of great creativity, who was doing his best to atone for some serious mistakes and errors of judgment,” Proctor said.
