The bill has yet to be approved by the Senate, where it faces an uncertain future.\n“At the start of the week, it was an outside risk. Now it’s a real risk,” Vassili Serebriakov, currency strategist at Credit Agricole in New York, said of a government shutdown.\nThe greenback held above Wednesday’s lows against a group of major currencies on a trade-weighted basis.\nIt touched the lowest level since December 2014 this week, with investors selling on the view that more central banks will join the Federal Reserve in raising interest rates, after years of ultra-loose policy adopted to combat the 2008 global financial crisis and subsequent recessions.\nAt 11:10 a.m./16:10 GMT, the trade-weighted dollar index was up 0.06 percent at 90.590.\nThe euro was down 0.07 percent at $1.2228, near a three-year high of $1.2323 touched on Wednesday. The common currency was on track to book a fifth straight week of gains in advance of next Thursday’s European Central Bank meeting.\nThe dollar was down 0.42 percent at 110.62 yen, with its rebound from Wednesday’s four-month low of 110.19 yen already fading even as benchmark U.S. 10-year yield rose to the highest level since Sept. 2014.\nA slim reduction in the Bank of Japan’s bond purchases this month spurred speculation about a possible pullback in its policy, even though many market players think any move will be many months away.\n“Markets are increasingly sensitive to the prospect of a less-dovish BOJ, which is putting pressure on dollar/yen,” UBS Wealth Management analysts said in a note. They added that they will be looking to the BOJ’s policy meeting next week to gain more clarity on its stance.\n“For now, we do not think the BOJ has any urgency to shift its yield curve control regime,” they added.\nAnother factor behind the dollar’s weakness has been global investors, including sovereign wealth funds and central banks, favoring other currencies.\nAdditional reporting by Jemima Kelly in New York; Hideyuki Sano in Tokyo; Editing by Mark Heinrich and Susan Thomas\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-01-20T00:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-20T03:02:06.012+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
