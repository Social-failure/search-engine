Xchange Leasing started to unwind over the last few months of 2017.\nFair, founded in 2016, matches customers with cars based on what they are able to pay each month. Customers get approved and pay for their car through Fair, which owns the vehicle, and pick up the car at a dealership.\nReporting by Munsif Vengattil in Bengaluru\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-30T11:03:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-30T11:41:46.017+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
