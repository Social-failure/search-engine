Enbridge Inc fell 2.4 percent to C$47.56 and TransCanada Corp declined 2.6 percent to C$57.72. * The overall energy group fell 1 percent, while U.S. crude oil futures pulled back from an earlier three-year high to settle 0.2 percent lower at $65.51 a barrel. * The materials group, which includes precious and base metals miners and fertilizer companies, lost 1.4 percent. * Gold dropped more than 1 percent, retreating after an early rise as the U.S. dollar strengthened when President Donald Trump talked up a stronger greenback. * NovaGold Resources Inc tumbled 10.8 percent to C$4.80. * The financials group, which accounts for more than one-third of the weight of the TSX, dipped 0.1 percent. * Five of the index's 10 main groups ended lower. * Marijuana stocks added to Wednesday's declines.

The planemaker is expected to lose a hotly contested U.S. trade dispute this week, a Canadian government source told Reuters on Thursday, likely inflaming tensions between the two countries during talks to modernize the North American Free Trade Agreement. * U.S. officials on Thursday probed Canadian proposals for unblocking talks on NAFTA but there were few signs of progress, raising questions about whether any real movement is happening at the latest round of negotiations on the treaty.
