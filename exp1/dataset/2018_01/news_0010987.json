Ukrainian servicemen fire a weapon in the direction of positions of the armed forces of the separatist self-proclaimed Donetsk People's Republic near the settlement of Zaitseve in Donetsk region, Ukraine January 10, 2018.

REUTERS/Maksim Levin \nIn the early hours of Thursday, a Reuters witness in Novoluhanske saw Ukrainian troops firing artillery towards rebel positions in an apparent response to the attack. \n“It’s clear we can’t stand such things from the enemy,” an artillery commander in a pro-Ukrainian militia group called Donbas Battalion told Reuters, calling himself by his nom de guerre Hayduk. \nThe rebel leadership meanwhile accused Ukraine of using artillery to attack the separatists for the first time since the New Year, separatist news website DAN reported. \nUnder the 2015 Minsk peace agreement, all heavy weapons were meant to have been withdrawn, but ceasefire monitors regularly report violations of this and other terms of the deal on both sides of the front line. \nIn an effort to end the deadlock, the international community, including the United States, has called for the deployment of U.N. peacekeepers in the Donbass region. \nBoth Kiev and Moscow back the idea but disagree on whether the troops should be positioned on the rebel-controlled part of the Ukraine-Russia border, and no decision has been made. \nRussia denies accusations from Ukraine and NATO that it supports the rebels with troops and weapons.
