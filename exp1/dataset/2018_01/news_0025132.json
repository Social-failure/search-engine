The IPCA consumer price index for household food products fell 5.1 percent on the quarter from the same period a year ago, and the drop was especially pronounced with Christmas-related food products, GPA said. \nNevertheless, the market reacted positively to GPA’s fourth quarter revenue, and shares in GPA had jumped 1.58 percent to 76.06 reais in morning trading. \nNet sales at GPA stores open for at least 12 months, known as same-store sales, jumped 3.5 percent in the fourth quarter. \nGPA’s Assai format, a type of store offering a wholesale format to final customers which has grown increasingly popular in recent years in Brazil, grew 10.7 percent. Sales at GPA’s more traditional Multivarejo formats fell 0.6 percent, after posting a modest gain last quarter. \nThe company said that among its Multivarejo formats, GPA’s flagship Pao de Acucar stores posted volume gains for the second straight quarter, indicating that consumers are increasingly willing to shop at the format, even as it is slightly more expensive that Assai.
