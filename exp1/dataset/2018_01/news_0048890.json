Slideshow (2 Images) \nCity manager Pep Guardiola was angered by Cardiff’s physical approach and said after Sunday’s game that Sane “will be out for a while, minimum two to three weeks or a month”. \n“I have said many times, all the referees have to do is protect the players - not just the Manchester City players, all players,” added the Spaniard. \nSane has been on top form this season with 11 goals and 14 assists in all competitions as City compete for four trophies.
