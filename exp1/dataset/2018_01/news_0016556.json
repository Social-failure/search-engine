Does that mean that I have to move all the front office people to Germany or not? ... and we are speaking of 2,000 people.”\nShe had added that local supervisors were asking for risk management to be done locally, a demand that would require more jobs to be moved. “It means another 2,000 people,” she had said at the time.\nReporting Arno Schuetze; Editing by Elaine Hardcastle\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-13T08:04:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-13T08:20:57.022+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
