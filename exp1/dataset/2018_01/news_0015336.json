The attacks hammered Kenya Airways by driving away tourists from the East African nation, which boasts palm-fringed beaches and safaris.\nCEO Mikosz said the new route aimed to encourage more business and tourist travel with the United States, which he said was the biggest source of visitors to Kenya.\nIn the first 10 months of 2017, 95,771 tourists traveled to Kenya from the United States, a figure that has been rising 20 percent in each of the past two years, he said.\nKenya also hosts regional hubs for 48 U.S. or U.S.-based, organizations, such as Google ( GOOGL.O ) and IBM ( IBM.N ), he added.\nThursday’s event was held at a five-star hotel to signal the end to recent hard times when gatherings were staged under a tent at the carrier’s training school to save costs.\nThe direct flights would create about 150 new jobs at Kenya Airways, said Mikosz, who was hired from LOT Polish airlines last June to help turn around the carrier.\nKenya Airways shares, which have tripled in value since the November restructuring, jumped 5.9 percent to 17.15 shillings ($0.1666) on Thursday.\nEditing by Edmund Blair\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-11T12:27:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-11T12:36:42.003+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
