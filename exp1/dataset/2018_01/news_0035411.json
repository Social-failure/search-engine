Moderate senators from both parties held talks on Sunday to broker a deal.\nU.S. Treasury debt futures prices fell 0.1 percent, or 2/32 in price, indicating the yield in the cash market was set to rise.\nBenchmark yields had hit a three-year peak on Friday as the government shutdown loomed.\n“The perception is they will come to their senses and do something here,” Tim Ghriskey, chief investment strategist at Inverness Counsel, said in reference to U.S. politicians. Inverness is an investment advisory firm in New York.\nBut “there’s certainly reason to become concerned” if the shutdown lasts for more than a week, Ghriskey said.\nIn the uncertain environment, U.S. bond yields are expected to climb higher, so investors should sell bonds, he said, adding he did not expect the shutdown to cause prices of U.S bonds or stocks to move sharply.
