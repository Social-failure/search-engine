Reuters reporters said most of the delegates they had spoken to had come from Damascus and did not oppose Assad.\nOne group of delegates who had flown in from Turkey and were opposed to Assad refused to leave Sochi airport until Syrian government flags and emblems were refused.\n“We will go back to Turkey,” Ahmad al-Burri, who has taken part in Syrian peace talks in Kazakhstan, told Reuters by phone.\n“Whatever happens we will not enter Sochi. We informed them (the Russians) of our conditions that they should remove all the logos and flags representing the Syrian government.”\nMohammed Adnan, a journalist and member of the Syrian opposition based in Turkey, said there were about 70 people in the group at the airport and that they were waiting for a plane to take them back to Ankara.\nRussian officials have complained of attempts to sabotage the conference, but the Kremlin said on Monday it was unfazed by a Syrian opposition decision to boycott the event.\nAdditional reporting by Maria Tsvetkova in Sochi; Writing by Andrew Osborn; Editing by Christian Lowe\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-01-30T15:53:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-31T16:32:42.006+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
