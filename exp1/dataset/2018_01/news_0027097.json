It will be more serious if there is no treatment or preventative measures. People will die,” said Radman from the capital of Sanaa.\nMalaria - which peaks in the rainy season - is endemic in Yemen, with more than 78 percent of people living in at-risk areas and a quarter of them in high-risk areas, WHO said.\nYemen’s health ministry, along with aid organizations, has distributed protective items such as mosquito nets, but Radman called the deteriorating situation a “serious issue”.\n“A failing sewage system, inadequate healthcare facilities and shortages in health workers and medical supplies, as well as restrictions on imports further compound the healthcare crisis,” said Hodeib of ICRC.\nAid agencies said this week that Yemen “faces a risk of famine” if there is prolonged and significant disruption to imports through its two key Red Sea ports, which also push food and fuel costs higher.\nReporting by Heba Kanso @hebakanso, Editing by Lyndsay Griffiths.; Please credit Thomson Reuters Foundation, the charitable arm of Thomson Reuters, that covers humanitarian news, women’s rights, trafficking, property rights, and climate change.
