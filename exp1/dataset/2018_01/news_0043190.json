Triangle is a business development company specializing in private equity and mezzanine investments.\nView this information on the law firm's Shareholder Rights Blog: www.robbinsarroyo.com/triangle-capital-corporation-jan-2018\nTriangle Accused of Hiding Poor Quality Investments and Deficient Underwriting Practices\nAccording to the complaint, Triangle officials knew as early as 2013, but failed to disclose, that the company should move away from mezzanine loan deals due to changes in the market that made these investments unattractive opportunities. On November 1, 2017, Triangle issued a press release announcing its financial results for the quarter ended September 30, 2017, revealing that the company's investment portfolio had declined 7%, and suffered $8.9 million in net realized losses, and $65.8 million in net unrealized depreciation. Furthermore, Triangle revealed that due to low earnings, it would be slashing its quarterly dividend by 33% per share from the previous quarter. On this news, Triangle's stock fell nearly 21%, to close at $9.68 per share on November 2, 2017.\nTriangle Shareholders Have Legal Options\nConcerned shareholders who would like more information about their rights and potential remedies can contact attorney Leonid Kandinov at (800) 350-6003, LKandinov@robbinsarroyo.com , or via the shareholder information form on the firm's website.\nRobbins Arroyo LLP is a nationally recognized leader in shareholder rights law.
