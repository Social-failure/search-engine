A spokeswoman for the registry declined to comment when asked if Assange had been granted citizenship.\nFollowing reports of the news in Ecuadorean media on Wednesday, Assange tweeted a photo of himself wearing the jersey of Ecuador’s national soccer team. Neither he nor his lawyers responded to requests for comment.\nEcuador’s Foreign Ministry in a statement said it was seeking to resolve Assange’s situation, without making reference to the citizenship issue. The ministry declined further comment.\nOn Tuesday, Foreign Minister Maria Fernanda Espinosa said Ecuador was exploring mediation to solve the standoff.\nAssange, who denies the rape allegations, fears that if he is arrested he will be handed over to the United States to face prosecution over WikiLeaks’ publication of thousands of classified military and diplomatic documents in one of the largest information leaks in U.S. history.\nReporting by Alexandra Valencia in Quito and Mark Hosenball in London; Writing by Brian Ellsworth; Editing by Sandra Maler\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-11T00:29:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-11T00:47:20.014+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
