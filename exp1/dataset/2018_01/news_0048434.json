I hadn’t played out of rye grass since last year. I hit some really good ones out of there. Unfortunately I put myself in there.” \nThough not thrilled with some of his wayward drives, he pointed out that he was not the only one to have trouble finding the short grass off the tee. \n“These are some of the narrowest fairways on tour and when I don’t have my best stuff -- and today was windy -- it compounded it. It made it very difficult for me.” \nWoods expressed satisfaction with his short game but despite apparently coming through the week without aggravating his back he would not reveal his schedule leading up to the Masters in April. \nHe is due to play the Genesis Open at Riviera in Los Angeles in three weeks, while he is also expected to play two or three tournaments in Florida before heading to Augusta. \n“I haven’t built out my schedule. We want to see how I was swinging after one tournament and reassess where I‘m at,” he said. \nHe finished at three-under 285 on Sunday on a course where he has won eight times. \nHe could not quite replicate the putting magic he displayed on Saturday but few others could either as the wind played just as much havoc with putting as full shots. \n“It’s nice to see I was able to still grind,” Woods said.
