Nigeria’s total power generation capacity is about 7,000 megawatts.\nMost of Nigeria’s power generation is from thermal power stations that use gas, according to the power ministry.\n“Once the national grid is restored, output from the hydroelectric power stations and all other unaffected gas-fired thermal power stations will be increased to the extent possible to minimize the impact of loss of generation from the affected power stations,” it said.\nSome businesses were not affected by the blackout, while for others the outage went unheeded.\nNigeria Liquefied Natural Gas - a joint venture between the state oil firm, Shell, Total and Eni - was unaffected, a spokesman said.\nIn the city of Bauchi in northeast Nigeria, the grid outage went unnoticed because people have already had weeks of power cuts.\nBalarabe Musa, a metalworker in Bauchi, complained that hours-long blackouts were eating into his wages. “I can’t use a generator to do my job, I need a constant power supply for welding metals,” he said.\nGovernment offices in Bauchi rely on generators, but high fuel costs mean they are too expensive as an alternative for some people.\nHairdresser Mama Ngozi said: “I can’t continue running the salon if the power failures continue like this.”\nReporting by Tife Owolabi; Additional reporting by Ardo Hazzad in Bauchi and Alexis Akwagyiram in London; Writing by Paul Carsten; Editing by Adrian Croft and Jane Merriman\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-03T12:54:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-03T13:04:57.014+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
