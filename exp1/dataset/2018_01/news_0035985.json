U.S. stocks advanced on Tuesday, as strong results from Netflix helped lift the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite . Chinese iron ore futures dropped 4 percent overnight, while copper prices fell to their lowest in a month after rising inventories showed healthy supplies of refined metal. The local share price index futures rose 0.3 percent or 17 points to 6,003, a 34-point discount to the underlying S&P/ASX 200 index close. The benchmark rose 45.1 points on Tuesday. New Zealand's benchmark S&P/NZX 50 index rose 0.2 percent to 8,325.18 in early trade.
