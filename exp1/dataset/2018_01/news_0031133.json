I‘m in the best shape of my life.”\nMcLeod will run at the Millward Games in New York on Feb. 2 where he will race in the sprints, something he is planning on also doing this season outdoors, while longer term his coach Edrick Floreal is planning on going even further out.\n“Coach and I... we’ve formulated a plan,” McLeod said.\n”He said after 2020 when I defend the Olympic title in the 110m hurdles, that’s when I will take in the 400m hurdles.\n“Hopefully I accomplish all the goals in the sprint hurdles, break all the records, do a little sprinting and then that’s when we’ll go back to the 400 hurdles.”\nEditing by Greg Stutchbury\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-20T09:34:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-20T09:54:51.009+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
