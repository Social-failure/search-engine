It expects to reach its goal of 5,000 vehicles per week by the end of the second quarter.\nReporting by Aishwarya Venugopal in Bengaluru; Editing by Savio D'Souza\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-26T00:54:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-26T01:13:39.023+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
