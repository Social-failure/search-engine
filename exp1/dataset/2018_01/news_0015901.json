At 0825 GMT, the stock was up 2.8 percent at 36.35 euros.\n$1 = 0.8384 euros Reporting by Manon Jacob; Editing by Subhranshu Sahu and Mark Potter\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-01-10T16:41:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-11T12:24:23.009+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
