And the longer they continue, the more likely people will fall through the cracks.”\nThe four east African nations provide sanctuary for millions fleeing drought in the Horn of Africa and protracted conflict in Somalia and South Sudan - the world’s youngest nation - where civil war has created the continent’s biggest refugee crisis.\nWFP has only received about one-fifth of almost $360 million required to support refugees in Ethiopia, Kenya, Rwanda and Tanzania in 2018, Smerdon said.\nHe warned that WFP would have to further reduce rations if funding did not come through.\n“If you a cut a refugee family’s rations, they will take their kids out of school to save money on costs such as uniforms and books, and send them out to either find food or work,” he said.\n“In a refugee camp, crime is likely to go up as people are likely to go into debt as people are already pretty poor. Over the longer term, child malnutrition will go up.”\nReporting by Nita Bhalla @nitabhalla, Editing by Katy Migiro.
