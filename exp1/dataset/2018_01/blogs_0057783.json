Flipkart also secured $1.4 billion from China’s Tencent, online marketplace eBay and software giant Microsoft .\nSoftBank owns roughly a fifth of Flipkart, while U.S. hedge fund Tiger Global Management owns a stake of slightly less than 20%, one of the sources told Reuters.\nA Walmart-Flipkart deal could be finalized as early as March, and may involve a direct investment and secondary sales by some longstanding Flipkart investors, the Indian paper said.\nIt makes little sense for Walmart to buy a stake in Flipkart unless it is looking to fully acquire the firm, said Harminder Sahni of retail consultant Wazir Advisors.\nA potential union of SoftBank-backed Chinese e-commerce player Alibaba and Flipkart would pose a more formidable challenge to Amazon, he added.\nBetting on Flipkart, though, will intensify Walmart’s battle with Amazon that has hurt brick-and-mortar rivals like it in their home U.S. market, pushing them to invest in online retail, offer discounts and improve the in-store shopping experience.\nSpokesmen for Flipkart and Walmart declined comment, saying the firms do not respond to market rumors or speculation.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-31T13:13:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-31T13:13:24.010+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
