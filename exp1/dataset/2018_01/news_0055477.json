According to the survey, 31 percent of respondents said hiding financial information from a spouse or significant other is worse than being physically unfaithful. \nBefore you make a financial and legal commitment to another person, O'Leary has some simple advice: Be sure to ask questions. \n\"Go out on a date and talk about my favorite topic, money,\" he says. \"Ask, 'Do you have any debt? Do you owe anything to anybody? How much money do you want to spend? In the next few years, are there are certain things you've got to have, even though we collectively can't afford them?'\" \nBe upfront with what you want, and be open to listening to what they want. \n\"Start to understand what's behind the thinking of your partner,\" O'Leary continues. \"If you're both in sync on this you're going to stay in love a lot longer and probably be more financially successful.\" \nIn his own marriage, O'Leary says he's on the same page as his wife, Linda. When they were starting out, they even had pizza and beer at their wedding to save money. \n\"You've got to talk about money,\" O'Leary says. \"You've got to understand the other person's thoughts, because they may end up being a nightmare for you.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-31T17:26:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-31T17:26:11.008+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
