Government officials respond they are fighting a U.S.-led right-wing conspiracy bent on ending socialism in Latin America, hobbling Venezuela’s economy and stealing its oil wealth.\nReporting by Luis Jaime Acosta; Writing by Julia Symmes Cobb; Editing by Frances Kerry\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-01-25T22:48:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-26T21:41:30.033+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
