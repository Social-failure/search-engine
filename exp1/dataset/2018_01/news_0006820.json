At the same time it balances the growing Russian and Chinese influence, he said.\nEU member countries have emerged as the most important investors in Cuba, led by Spain, France and Italy, and the bloc is the second trading partner. EU countries also account for around 30 percent of tourists who visit the country.\nToday, Cuban commerce is so spread around the world that no single country accounts for more than 20 percent of total merchandise trade. Richard Feinberg, an economist and expert on Latin America and Cuba at the Brookings Institution, said.\nStrong relations with Europe fits into their international diversification strategy so as not to be dependent on anyone, he said.
