The non-life insurer has annual net premium revenue of 36.6 billion yen, while top insurers have revenues of about 2 trillion yen.\nHelped by its vast customer base from its online shopping services, revenue from Rakuten’s financial services has grown to account for 38 percent of overall sales in the last financial year. That is just behind its domestic e-commerce business, which accounted for about 40 percent of sales.\nNomura, which owns more than 50 percent of ordinary shares in Asahi Fire & Marine, said in a statement it intended to participate in the offering.\nJapan’s biggest brokerage and investment bank has been seeking to shift capital into areas where it sees more growth. It is expanding its U.S. investment banking business, with a focus on M&A advisory services as it tries to grab a bigger share of the world’s biggest investment banking fee pool.\nShares in Rakuten fell 0.7 percent on the day, giving it a market value of about $13.3 billion.\nAdditional reporting by Kaori Kaneko, Taiga Uranaka and Thomas Wilson; Editing by Edwina Gibbs\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-29T01:37:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-29T01:45:11.006+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
