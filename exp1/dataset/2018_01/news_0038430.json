Participation in the survey was voluntary, and respondents were recruited from thousands of sources to maximize reach and representation of the U.S. workforce. A company’s score is determined by three parts, direct employee recommendations, a public perception score and an index of objective and publicly available diversity key performance indicators.\nEaton is a power management company with 2016 sales of $19.7 billion.
