(NYSE:MET) today announced it has postponed its earnings report and conference call related to its results for the fourth quarter and full year ended Dec. 31, 2017, which had previously been scheduled for Jan. 31, 2018, and Feb. 1, 2018, respectively. MetLife will now issue its fourth quarter and full year 2017 earnings report and its Fourth Quarter Financial Supplement on Tuesday, Feb. 13, 2018 after the market closes. The company will hold its earnings conference call and audio webcast on Wednesday, Feb. 14, 2018 from 8:00 to 9:00 a.m. (EST). MetLife expects to file its 2017 Form 10-K by March 1, 2018.\nOn its Dec. 15, 2017, Investor Outlook Call, MetLife announced that it was undertaking a review of practices and procedures used to estimate its reserves related to certain Retirement and Income Solutions group annuitants who have been unresponsive or missing over time.\nManagement of the company has determined the prior release of group annuity reserves resulted from a material weakness in internal control over financial reporting. MetLife expects to increase reserves in total between $525 million and $575 million pre-tax, to adjust for reserves previously released, as well as accrued interest and other related liabilities. The amount of the reserve increase is based in substantial part on actuarial, legal, statistical, and other assumptions. If actual facts and factors differ from those the company has assumed, the reserve the company has established could be adversely or positively affected.\nThe total amount expected to impact fourth quarter 2017 net income is between $135 million and $165 million pre-tax, the majority of which represents a current period strengthening of reserves and will be reflected in Adjusted Earnings (formerly known as Operating Earnings)*.We expect the full year 2017 net income impact to be between $165 million and $195 million pre-tax. In addition, the company intends to make prior period revisions to reflect the balance of these adjustments in the appropriate historical periods. The company also expects to correct historical periods for unrelated errors in those periods, as required by accounting standards. Those errors were previously recorded in the periods in which the company identified them.\nRevisions to prior periods will be included in MetLife’s 2017 Form 10-K and Fourth Quarter Financial Supplement. These revisions will not constitute a restatement of previously issued financial statements. These pre-tax revisions will be taxed at the 35% U.S. tax rate in effect, and the impacts of the recently enacted U.S. tax reform legislation will be reflected in Corporate & Other in the fourth quarter of 2017.\nIn connection with MetLife’s review and enhancement of the processes and procedures relating to its Retirement and Income Solutions business in the United States, MetLife is currently reviewing its processes and procedures for identifying unresponsive and missing international group annuity annuitants and pension beneficiaries. In addition, MetLife recently initiated an ongoing global review of its processes and procedures for identifying unresponsive and missing policyholders and beneficiaries for the other insurance and annuity products it offers. MetLife is not currently aware of any material deficiencies in its identification of unresponsive or missing annuitants, policyholders or beneficiaries with respect to such products under review.\nMetLife had previously informed its primary state regulator, the New York Department of Financial Services, about this matter and is responding to questions from them and other state regulators. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission enforcement staff has also made an inquiry regarding this matter and MetLife is responding to its questions. To date, MetLife is not aware of any intentional wrongdoing in connection with this matter.\nThe company is preannouncing the following unaudited preliminary fourth quarter 2017 results:\nPreliminary Fourth Quarter Results\nNet income of $2.0 to $2.1 billion. On a per share basis, net income is expected to be between $1.91 and $1.96 per share. Net income includes approximately $92 million, after tax, in net derivative losses reflecting changes in foreign currencies, interest rates and equity markets. Net income includes approximately $1.2 billion, after tax, benefit related to the impact of U.S. tax reform which includes a negative impact to adjusted earnings of approximately $300 million. Adjusted Earnings* of $650 to $700 million, or $0.61 to $0.66 per share. Notable items decreased adjusted earnings between $490 million and $510 million after tax in the fourth quarter of 2017, including the pre-mentioned impact of U.S. tax reform. On a per share basis, net notable items are expected to be between $0.46 and $0.48. Book value of $53.51 to $53.56 per share. Book value, excluding accumulated other comprehensive income (AOCI) other than foreign currency translation adjustments (FCTA)*, of $42.18 to $42.23 per share. Adjusted ROE*, excluding AOCI other than FCTA, of 6.0% to 6.4%.\n* Information regarding the non-GAAP and other financial measures included in this news release and the reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP measures is provided in the Non-GAAP and Other Financial Disclosures discussions below. Adjusted measures were formerly referred to as operating measures.\nAbout MetLife\nMetLife, Inc.

(vii) adjusted return on MetLife, Inc.’s common stockholders’ equity, excluding AOCI other than FCTA. In this news release, MetLife presents certain measures of its performance that are not calculated in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”). MetLife believes that these non-GAAP financial measures enhance the understanding of MetLife’s performance by highlighting the results of operations and the underlying profitability drivers of the business. The following non-GAAP financial measures should not be viewed as substitutes for the most directly comparable financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP:\nNon-GAAP financial measures: Comparable GAAP financial measures: (i) adjusted revenues; (i) revenues; (ii) adjusted expenses; (ii) expenses; (iii) adjusted earnings; (iii) income (loss) from continuing operations, net of income tax; (iv) adjusted earnings available to common shareholders; (iv) net income (loss) available to MetLife, Inc.’s common shareholders; (v) adjusted earnings available to common shareholders, excluding total notable items; (v) net income (loss) available to MetLife, Inc.’s common shareholders; (vi) adjusted earnings available to common shareholders per diluted common share; (vi) net income (loss) available to MetLife, Inc.’s common shareholders per diluted common share; (vii) adjusted return on equity; and (vii) return on equity; and (viii) adjusted return on equity, excluding AOCI other than FCTA. (viii) return on equity. MetLife’s definitions of the various non-GAAP and other financial measures discussed in this news release may differ from those used by other companies:\nAdjusted earnings and related measures\nadjusted earnings; adjusted earnings available to common shareholders; adjusted earnings available to common shareholders, excluding total notable items; and adjusted earnings available to common shareholders per diluted common share.\nThese measures are used by management to evaluate performance and allocate resources. Consistent with GAAP guidance for segment reporting, adjusted earnings is also MetLife’s GAAP measure of segment performance. Adjusted earnings and other financial measures based on adjusted earnings are also the measures by which MetLife senior management’s and many other employees’ performance is evaluated for the purposes of determining their compensation under applicable compensation plans. Adjusted earnings and other financial measures based on adjusted earnings allow analysis of our performance relative to our business plan and facilitate comparisons to industry results.\nAdjusted earnings is defined as adjusted revenues less adjusted expenses, both net of income tax. Adjusted earnings available to common shareholders is defined as adjusted earnings less preferred stock dividends.\nAdjusted revenues and adjusted expenses\nThese financial measures, along with the related adjusted premiums, fees and other revenues, focus on our primary businesses principally by excluding the impact of market volatility, which could distort trends, and revenues and costs related to non-core products and certain entities required to be consolidated under GAAP. Also, these measures exclude results of discontinued operations under GAAP and other businesses that have been or will be sold or exited by MetLife but do not meet the discontinued operations criteria under GAAP and are referred to as divested businesses. Divested businesses also includes the net impact of transactions with exited businesses that have been eliminated in consolidation under GAAP and costs relating to businesses that have been or will be sold or exited by MetLife that do not meet the criteria to be included in results of discontinued operations under GAAP. In addition, for the year ended December 31, 2016, adjusted revenues and adjusted expenses exclude the financial impact of converting MetLife’s Japan operations to calendar-year end reporting without retrospective application of this change to prior periods and is referred to as lag elimination. Adjusted revenues also excludes net investment gains (losses) (NIGL) and net derivative gains (losses) (NDGL). Adjusted expenses also excludes goodwill impairments.\nThe following additional adjustments are made to revenues, in the line items indicated, in calculating adjusted revenues:\nUniversal life and investment-type product policy fees excludes the amortization of unearned revenue related to NIGL and NDGL and certain variable annuity guaranteed minimum income benefits (GMIB) fees (GMIB fees); Net investment income: (i) includes earned income on derivatives and amortization of premium on derivatives that are hedges of investments or that are used to replicate certain investments but do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment, (ii) excludes post-tax adjusted earnings adjustments relating to insurance joint ventures accounted for under the equity method, (iii) excludes certain amounts related to contractholder-directed unit-linked investments, and (iv) excludes certain amounts related to securitization entities that are variable interest entities (VIEs) consolidated under GAAP; and Other revenues are adjusted for settlements of foreign currency earnings hedges.\nThe following additional adjustments are made to expenses, in the line items indicated, in calculating adjusted expenses:\nPolicyholder benefits and claims and policyholder dividends excludes: (i) changes in the policyholder dividend obligation related to NIGL and NDGL, (ii) inflation-indexed benefit adjustments associated with contracts backed by inflation-indexed investments and amounts associated with periodic crediting rate adjustments based on the total return of a contractually referenced pool of assets and other pass through adjustments, (iii) benefits and hedging costs related to GMIBs (GMIB costs), and (iv) market value adjustments associated with surrenders or terminations of contracts (Market value adjustments); Interest credited to policyholder account balances includes adjustments for earned income on derivatives and amortization of premium on derivatives that are hedges of policyholder account balances but do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment and excludes amounts related to net investment income earned on contractholder-directed unit-linked investments; Amortization of DAC and value of business acquired (VOBA) excludes amounts related to: (i) NIGL and NDGL, (ii) GMIB fees and GMIB costs and (iii) Market value adjustments; Amortization of negative VOBA excludes amounts related to Market value adjustments; Interest expense on debt excludes certain amounts related to securitization entities that are VIEs consolidated under GAAP; and Other expenses excludes costs related to: (i) noncontrolling interests, (ii) implementation of new insurance regulatory requirements, and (iii) acquisition, integration and other costs.\nAdjusted earnings also excludes the recognition of certain contingent assets and liabilities that could not be recognized at acquisition or adjusted for during the measurement period under GAAP business combination accounting guidance.\nThe tax impact of the adjustments mentioned above are calculated net of the U.S. or foreign statutory tax rate, which could differ from the company’s effective tax rate. Additionally, the provision for income tax (expense) benefit also includes the impact related to the timing of certain tax credits, as well as certain tax reforms.\nReturn on equity and related measures\nAdjusted return on MetLife, Inc.'s common stockholders' equity, excluding AOCI other than FCTA: adjusted earnings available to common shareholders divided by MetLife, Inc.'s average common stockholders' equity, excluding AOCI other than FCTA. Return on MetLife, Inc.'s common stockholders' equity, excluding AOCI other than FCTA: net income (loss) available to MetLife, Inc.’s common shareholders divided by MetLife, Inc.'s average common stockholders' equity, excluding AOCI other than FCTA.\nThe above measures represent a level of equity consistent with the view that, in the ordinary course of business, we do not plan to sell most investments for the sole purpose of realizing gains or losses. Also refer to the utilization of adjusted earnings and other financial measures based on adjusted earnings mentioned above.\nThe following additional information is relevant to an understanding of MetLife’s performance results:\nNotable items represent a positive (negative) impact to adjusted earnings available to common shareholders. Notable items reflect the unexpected impact of events that affect the company’s results, but that were unknown and that the company could not anticipate when it devised its Business Plan. Notable items also include certain items regardless of the extent anticipated in the Business Plan, to help investors have a better understanding of company results and to evaluate and forecast those results.\nForward-Looking Statements and Other Financial Information\nThis news release may contain or incorporate by reference information that includes or is based upon forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.

Please consult any further disclosures MetLife, Inc. makes on related subjects in reports to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. Further, in this news release, MetLife, Inc. presents certain measures of its performance that are not calculated in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”). We believe that these non-GAAP financial measures enhance the understanding of our performance by highlighting the results of operations and the underlying profitability drivers of the business. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures is not accessible on a forward-looking basis because we believe it is not possible without unreasonable efforts to provide other than a range of net investment gains and losses and net derivative gains and losses, which can fluctuate significantly within or outside the range and from period to period and may have a material impact on net income.\nView source version on businesswire.com : http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180129006171/en/\nMetLife, Inc.\nFor Media:\nJohn Calagna, 212-578-6252\nor\nRandolph Clerihue, 212-578-5061\nor\nFor Investors:\nJohn Hall, 212-578-7888\nSource: MetLife, Inc.", "external_links": ["http://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.metlife.com&esheet=51750495&newsitemid=20180129006171&lan=en-US&anchor=www.metlife.com&index=1&md5=675b7ec3d59a487553313a680ccba238", "http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180129006171/en/"], "published": "2018-01-30T00:18:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-30T03:39:48.005+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
