Markkanen missed a 3-pointer with 1:12 left, but Chicago grabbed the rebound and Kris Dunn found Markkanen, whose shot represented the 23rd lead change.\nAfter Markkanen’s shot, Bradley’s 14-footer was blocked by David Nwaba with 52 seconds remaining. Following a replay review that showed Detroit grabbed the rebound, Andre Drummond missed a layup and Chicago secured the rebound.\nBradley fouled Dunn with 38 seconds left, and the Chicago guard split two free throws. Detroit missed a chance at a one-point lead when Bradley misfired on a 3-pointer and missed a chance to tie the game at the buzzer when Reggie Bullock missed a layup while absorbing heavy contact following a Chicago turnover.\nDunn added 18 points, eight assists and eight rebounds for the Bulls, who shot 48.3 percent and made 17 of 36 from 3-point range.\nBradley led Detroit with 26 points on 10-of-19 shooting, including six 3-pointers. Bradley, however, was 1-of-7 in the final 12 minutes.\nDrummond scored eight of his 21 in the fourth quarter and also grabbed 15 rebounds for his 28th double-double of the season. Tobias Harris was held to seven points on 3-of-14 shooting from the field.\nBefore Markkanen gave Chicago the lead for good, Portis hit a 3-pointer for a 100-95 lead with 5:56 remaining after Drummond’s putback dunk. Including the dunk, Drummond scored eight straight Detroit points and his tip-in gave Detroit a 101-100 lead with 4:12 remaining.\nAfter Dunn’s 16-footer with 3:11 left made it 102-101 Chicago, Harris gave Detroit a one-point lead with a layup on the next possession.\n--Field Level Media\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-01-14T11:47:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-14T20:26:20.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
