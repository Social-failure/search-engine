The parties are currently finalizing preparations for closing, and now anticipate that the combination will complete in the first half of February 2018.\nIn July 2017 Yandex and Uber announced the intention to combine their ride-sharing businesses in Russia, Kazakhstan, Azerbaijan, Armenia, Belarus and Georgia. In late 2017 the companies received all necessary regulatory approvals.\nAfter the closing, consumers will be able to use both Yandex.Taxi and Uber apps, while the driver-side apps will be integrated. Uber will also contribute its UberEATS business in the region to the combined company.\nAbout Yandex\nYandex (NASDAQ:YNDX) is a technology company that builds intelligent products and services powered by machine learning. Our goal is to help consumers and businesses better navigate the online and offline world. Since 1997, we have delivered world-class, locally relevant search and information services.

We started in 2010 to solve a simple problem: how do you get a ride at the touch of a button? Six years and more than five billion trips later, we’ve started tackling an even greater challenge: reducing congestion and pollution in our cities by getting more people into fewer cars.\nThis press release contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties.
