Confirmed speakers include David Hughes, VP of IP Engineering at PCCW Global.\nTopics to be discussed at the event include:\nThe autonomous network is here. Are you ready for it? The scope for robotic process automation (RPA) and machine learning (ML) in telecom operations Enabling and automating next-gen networks with intent-based modeling Autonomous network ingredients – maturity and adoption What telcos can learn about automation from other industries Closed loop automation for NFV Automation in the carrier WAN\n“Automation is not a new topic in the telecom industry. But as the telecom and IT worlds start to merge with technologies such as NFV it is apparent that telecom operators lag their public cloud peers in terms of network automation,” says James Crawshaw, senior analyst, Heavy Reading. “Admittedly the network domains and services that a communication service provider delivers are more complex than those of public cloud operators. Nonetheless, there is significant scope for CSPs to catch up with their cloud peers and that is where new technologies like RPA and ML can help.”\nEarly bird passes are available for $699. All service providers and cable operators qualify for free admission.
