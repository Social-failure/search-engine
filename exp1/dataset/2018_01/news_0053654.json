Gazprom sources said that lessons have been drawn from recent defeats on the European gas market.\nThe Vienna conference has been attended by a number of Gazprom’s key customers in Europe, such as Austria’s OMV and Germany’s RWE.\nGazprom’s Deputy Chief Executive Alexander Medvedev told the conference that healthy demand for the Russian gas in Europe will help to maintain Russian gas exports around current levels.\n“We believe that demand factors will support export of around 190 bcm per year, although obviously influenced by weather factors,” he said, adding that Russian gas exports to Europe in January has fallen by only 3 percent year on year despite warm weather.\n“Europe will need an additional 50 bcm of gas imports by 2025 and 75 bcm by 2035. I think these figures are attractive enough for all gas industry stakeholders and investors.”\nRussia has been seeking to boost its energy influence in Europe by building more pipelines, such as Nord Stream 2 and TurkStream, to bypass Ukraine.\nOne of the two TurkStream lines is designed to ship the Russian gas via the Black Sea to Turkey. The annual capacity of each pipeline is 15.75 bcm and project is due to be completed by the end of 2019.\nMedvedev said there are different options under discussion on how to use the second line, including the possible use of Austria’s Baumgarten gas hub.
