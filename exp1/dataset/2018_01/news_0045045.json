Marufu - for the paper.\nUniversity of Zimbabwe vice chancellor Levi Nyagura did not respond to calls for comment.\nThere had been widespread speculation that Grace had been fraudulently awarded the doctorate, which was dedicated to her husband “because of his dedication and commitment to the well-being of the people of Zimbabwe”.\nBut Grace, who was lauded as “learned mother of the nation” by adulating followers, defended her academic record, telling a ZANU-PF rally in September that she had earned her PhD when her detractors thought otherwise.\nIn its abstract, Grace acknowledged that one weakness of her research was that “some interviewees tended to tell me what they thought I wanted to hear”.\nGoodson Nguni, lead investigator at the Zimbabwe Anti Corruption Commission, could not be reached for comment on whether the anti-graft agency would continue with its probe.\nNew President Emmerson Mnangagwa has made fighting corruption a top priority. Mnangagwa, 75, told the World Economic Forum in Davos this week Mugabe and his wife Grace had not been granted immunity from prosecution.\nReporting by MacDonald Dzirutwe; Editing by Ed Cropley and Ralph Boulton\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-26T11:22:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-26T11:35:49.002+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
