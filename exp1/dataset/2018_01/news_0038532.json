Sandhu, a senior police official, adding that police had detained 15 protesters.\n“We will not tolerate any violence in the name of protests against a movie,” Sandhu added. “Sporadic rioting did take place but no one will be allowed to protest now.”\nIndian films that touch upon the historical relationships of Hindus, India’s majority religion, and Muslim leaders are often controversial.\nIn the financial capital of Mumbai, police have boosted security at all theatres screening the film, and detained more than 100 members of protest groups, such as the conservative Sri Rajput Karni Sena, as a precaution, a senior police official said.\nBurnt vehicles, which were set on fire Tuesday night, following a protest by people belonging to Rajput community against the release of the upcoming Bollywood movie \"Padmaavat\", are pictured outside a multiplex in Ahmedabad, India January 24, 2018. REUTERS/Amit Dave Police are also closely monitoring social media, he added.\nPolice had to open fire to disperse crowds on Tuesday night as protests against the film turned increasingly violent, with vandalism around multiplexes in the western state of Gujarat and dozens of motorcycles being set on fire.\nPolice have arrested 20 men involved, said Kalpesh Patel, a police officer in the state’s key industrial city of Ahmedabad.\nThe protests are expected to continue around the country.\nSlideshow (7 Images) “We have decided not to play the movie in any of our properties in Gujarat and Rajasthan,” Deepak Asher, director of Inox multiplexes, India’s second largest theatre chain, told Reuters, referring to the two states hit by the worst protests.\n“Our primary concern is the security of our employees and audiences. I think this is a decision that almost every theatre owner in these two states has taken,” he added.\nIn Chhattisgarh, dozens of members of the Rajput community staged protests and burned an effigy of Bhansali on Tuesday, Rakesh Singh Bais of the community group Sarwa Kshatriya Mahasabha told Reuters.\nPolice in Rajasthan have enforced tight security for protests planned by the Karni Sena and other Rajput groups, its police chief, O. P. Galhotra, said.\n“We have been talking to the leaders of the Karni Sena and they don’t want to end their protest,” Galhotra added. “We have decided to allow them to hold small protests, and have made adequate arrangements to maintain law and order.”\nAnyone trying to depict history as fiction will have to pay a price for their mistake, said Rajvansh Singh, an official of the Karni Sena in the city of Chittorgarh in Rajasthan, who called himself the custodian of respect for Rajput women.\n“We will not allow the movie to be released,” he said. “Queen Padmini is like our goddess, no one will be allowed to insult our goddess and our Hindu pride.”\n by Shilpa Jamkhandikar and Rajendra Jadhav; Writing by Swati Bhat; Editing by Euan Rocha and Clarence Fernandez\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-24T08:32:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-24T09:07:05.002+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
