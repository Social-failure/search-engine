CEO Evan Spiegel smiles before ringing the opening bell at the New York Stock Exchange as his company celebrates its IPO, Thursday, March 2, 2017. \nSnapchat users will soon be able to share Stories outside the app to Facebook and Twitter in an effort to spark growth on the social media app. \nUsers will be able to share Stories to their linked social media accounts or through text or email with a link to a webpage where people who don't have the app can view the message. \nSnap launched Stories in 2014 as a way to share photos and videos with all of your followers at once. The updates live on the app for 24 hours and can be replayed, unlike messages sent to a single user that disappear after opening. \nStarting Wednesday, the feature will be available to users who have already received the redesigned Snapchat app . It will roll out to other users over the next few weeks.
