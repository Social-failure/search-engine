At least at one Starbucks location in Seattle.\nThe coffee giant is testing a cashless store \"just to see\" how digital and credit card payments affect customer behavior and experience at the restaurant. \n\"Thirty percent of our payments in the United States [are] done with a mobile phone,\" CEO Kevin Johnson said on CNBC's \"Squawk on the Street\" Friday. \"Over 40 percent is done with phones and Star Value cards with rewards.
