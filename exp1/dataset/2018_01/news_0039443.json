(Nasdaq:CCBG) today reported net income of $3,000, or $0.00 per diluted share for the fourth quarter of 2017 which included a $4.0 million, or $0.24 per diluted share, income tax expense related to the tax reform act commonly known as Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “Tax Act”) enacted on December 22, 2017, compared to net income of $4.6 million, or $0.27 per diluted share for the third quarter of 2017, and $3.3 million, or $0.20 per diluted share, for the fourth quarter of 2016.\nNet income for the fourth quarter, excluding the impact of the Tax Act (“core earnings”) a non-GAAP financial measure, totaled $4.0 million, or $0.24 per diluted share.\nFor the full year 2017, net income was 10.9 million, or $0.64 per diluted share, compared to net income of $11.7 million, or $0.69 per diluted share in 2016. Core earnings for 2017 totaled $14.9 million, or $0.88 per diluted share.\nCore earnings is presented in this press release to enable investors to better compare period-to-period results due to the effect of the Tax Act on 2017 fourth quarter and full year results of operations. Reconciliations of this and other non-GAAP financial measures in this press release are included in the financial tables at the end of this press release.\nFull Year 2017 HIGHLIGHTS\nCore earnings per diluted share of $0.88, 28% increase over 2016 Significant improvement in operating leverage driven by margin expansion and expense reduction Net interest income up $5.0 million, or 6.4% Average loan growth of $76 million, or 5.0% Noninterest expense down $3.8 million, or 3.3% NPAs and classified assets down 42% and 33%, respectively\nFourth Quarter 2017 HIGHLIGHTS\nCore earnings per diluted share of $0.24, down $0.03 sequentially due to other real estate owned gains in the third quarter of 2017 Continued growth in net interest income, up $0.2 million, or 1.1 % sequentially NPAs and classified assets, down sequentially by 12% and 18%, respectively\n“This year produced marked improvement in our overall performance as core earnings increased 28 percent,” said William G. Smith, Jr., Chairman, President and CEO. “These results were driven by loan growth, a rising rate environment, improving credit costs and a disciplined approach to managing expenses. Our net interest margin has increased 12 basis points year over year, aided by an asset-sensitive balance sheet and strong core deposit base. Since 2010, we have reduced annual expenses by $24 million and this was our seventh consecutive year of expense reduction. We are proud of these accomplishments and remain focused on strategies that will produce long-term value for our shareowners.”\nCompared to the third quarter of 2017, the decrease in core earnings was primarily attributable to a higher loan loss provision of $0.3 million, a $0.2 million increase in noninterest expense, lower noninterest income of $0.1 million, and higher income taxes of $0.2 million, partially offset by higher net interest income of $0.2 million.\nCompared to the fourth quarter of 2016, the increase in core earnings reflected higher net interest income of $1.4 million, a $0.7 million decrease in noninterest expense, and a $0.1 million increase in noninterest income, partially offset by higher income taxes of $1.1 million and a $0.4 million increase in the loan loss provision.\nFor the full year 2017, the increase in core earnings compared to 2016 was attributable to higher net interest income of $5.0 million and a $3.8 million reduction in noninterest expense, partially offset by lower noninterest income of $1.9 million, a $2.3 million increase in income taxes, and a $1.4 million increase in the loan loss provision.\nOur return on average assets (“ROA”) was 0.00% and our return on average equity (“ROE”) was 0.00% for the fourth quarter of 2017. Our core earnings ROA was 0.57% and our core earnings ROE was 5.56% for the fourth quarter of 2017. These metrics were 0.65% and 6.33% for the third quarter of 2017, respectively, and 0.48% and 4.70% for the fourth quarter of 2016, respectively. For the full year 2017, our ROA was 0.39% and our ROE was 3.83%. Our core earnings ROA was 0.53% and our core earnings ROE was 5.26% for the full year 2017, compared to 0.43% and 4.22%, respectively, for the same period in 2016.\nDiscussion of Operating Results\nTax equivalent net interest income for the fourth quarter of 2017 was $21.8 million compared to $21.6 million for the third quarter of 2017 and $20.3 million for the fourth quarter of 2016. During the fourth quarter of 2017, overnight funds increased as a result of the growth in noninterest bearing deposits, and to a lesser degree, seasonal growth in our public funds deposits. A portion of these overnight funds were used to fund growth in the loan and investment portfolios. The increase in tax equivalent net interest income compared to the fourth quarter of 2016 reflected growth in the loan portfolio and higher rates earned on overnight funds, investment securities, and variable rate loans, partially offset by a higher cost on our negotiated rate deposits. For the full year 2017, tax equivalent net interest income totaled $84.2 million compared to $79.0 million for the prior year. The year over year increase was driven by growth in the loan and investment portfolios, coupled with higher short-term rates, partially offset by a higher rate paid on negotiated rate deposits and one less calendar day as 2016 was a leap year.\nThe overnight funds rate has increased five times since December 2015 to a target rate of 1.50% at the end of 2017, which positively affected our net interest income due to favorable repricing of our variable and adjustable rate earning assets. Although these increases have also resulted in higher rates paid on our negotiated rate products, we continue to prudently manage our overall cost of funds, which was 18 and 16 basis points for the fourth quarter and full year 2017, respectively. Despite highly competitive fixed-rate loan pricing across most markets, we continue to review our loan pricing and make adjustments where appropriate.\nOur net interest margin for the fourth quarter of 2017 was 3.45%, a decrease of three basis points compared to the third quarter of 2017 and an increase of 11 basis points from the fourth quarter of 2016. For the full year 2017, the net interest margin increased 12 basis points to 3.37% compared to 2016. The decrease in the margin compared to the third quarter of 2017 was due to seasonal growth in our overnight funds, resulting in a slightly less favorable asset mix. The increase in the margin compared to the fourth quarter of 2016 and the prior full year was primarily attributable to loan growth, and higher yields on overnight funds and the investment portfolio, partially offset by higher rates on our negotiated rate deposits.\nThe provision for loan losses for the fourth quarter of 2017 was $0.8 million compared to $0.5 million for the third quarter of 2017 and $0.5 million for the fourth quarter of 2016. The higher provision for the fourth quarter of 2017 reflected higher impaired reserves held for two problem loans. For the full year 2017, the loan loss provision totaled $2.2 million compared to $0.8 million for 2016 with the increase primarily attributable to a higher level of net charge-offs and growth in the loan portfolio. Net loan charge-offs for the fourth quarter of 2017 totaled $0.9 million compared to net loan charge-offs of $0.4 million for the third quarter of 2017 and net loan charge-offs of $0.8 million for the fourth quarter of 2016. For the full year 2017, net loan charge-offs totaled $2.3 million (consisting of gross charge-offs of $4.8 million, less recoveries of $2.5 million), or 0.14% of average loans compared to $1.3 million (consisting of gross charge-offs of $4.7 million, less recoveries of $3.4 million), or 0.09% for 2016. At December 31, 2017, the allowance for loan losses of $13.3 million was 0.80% of outstanding loans (net of overdrafts) and provided coverage of 186% of nonperforming loans compared to 0.82% and 203%, respectively, at September 30, 2017 and 0.86% and 157%, respectively, at December 31, 2016.\nNoninterest income for the fourth quarter of 2017 totaled $12.9 million, a decrease of $0.1 million, or 0.8%, from the third quarter of 2017 and an increase of $0.1 million, or 0.9%, over the fourth quarter of 2016. The decrease from the third quarter of 2017 was attributable to lower deposit fees and the increase over the fourth quarter of 2016 reflected higher wealth management fees of $0.4 million, partially offset by lower other income of $0.2 million and deposit fees of $0.1 million. For the full year 2017, noninterest income totaled $51.7 million, a $1.9 million, or 3.6%, decrease from 2016, attributable to lower other income of $2.7 million and deposit fees of $1.0 million, partially offset by higher wealth management fees of $1.2 million and mortgage banking fees of $0.6 million. The decrease in other income was attributable to a $2.5 million gain from the partial retirement of our trust preferred securities in the second quarter of 2016. Lower fees related to data processing services provided to third parties also contributed to the decrease and reflected the discontinuance of this line of business over the past two years with our last client discontinuing service in the fourth quarter of 2017. The reduction in deposit fees reflected lower utilization of our overdraft service product. Growth in assets under management as well as improved sales efforts have resulted in strong growth in wealth management fees. Strong home sales in our markets and a growing market share of residential loan production have driven the improvement in mortgage banking fees.\nNoninterest expense for the fourth quarter of 2017 totaled $26.9 million, an increase of $0.2 million, or 0.7%, over the third quarter of 2017, and a $0.7 million, or 2.4%, decrease from the fourth quarter of 2016. The increase over the third quarter of 2017 reflected higher other real estate owned (“OREO”) expense of $0.5 million and other expense of $0.4 million, partially offset by lower compensation expense of $0.6 million and occupancy expense of $0.1 million. The decrease from the fourth quarter of 2016 was attributable to lower compensation expense of $1.0 million and occupancy expense of $0.1 million, partially offset by higher other expense of $0.4 million. For the full year 2017, noninterest expense totaled $109.4 million, a decrease of $3.8 million, or 3.3%, from 2016 attributable to lower OREO expense of $2.5 million, other expense of $0.7 million, occupancy expense of $0.5 million, and compensation expense of $0.1 million. All OREO expense categories (gain/loss on sale, carrying costs, and valuation adjustments) declined as we continued efforts to liquidate our remaining properties. Reduction in other cycle related expenses (legal expense and FDIC insurance expense) drove the decline in other expense. The decrease in occupancy expense reflected our continuing efforts to optimize our banking office structure and operational processes. The decrease in compensation expense reflected lower salary expense of $1.2 million partially offset by higher associate benefit expense of $1.1 million. Continued headcount attrition drove the decline in salary expense and the increase in associate benefit expense reflected higher pension plan expense attributable to utilization of a lower discount rate for plan liabilities and to a lesser extent higher associate insurance expense and stock compensation expense.\nWe realized income tax expense of $6.7 million for the fourth quarter of 2017 which included a $4.0 million discrete tax expense related to the Tax Act. Excluding the discrete tax expense, income tax totaled $2.7 million (39% effective rate) compared to $2.5 million (35% effective rate) for the third quarter of 2017 and $1.5 million (32% effective rate) for the fourth quarter of 2016. For the full year 2017, income tax expense totaled $12.2 million, including the aforementioned $4.0 million discrete tax expense related to the Tax Act. Excluding the discrete tax expense, income tax totaled $8.2 million (36% effective rate) compared to $5.9 million (33% effective rate) for 2016. Income tax expense for the fourth quarter included a $0.3 million write-off of a deferred tax asset related to a cancelled stock award. Income tax for the full year 2017 also included income tax benefits realized in the second quarter related to stock based compensation awards. Absent future discrete events, we anticipate that our effective tax will approximate 24% due to a lower federal tax rate related to the Tax Act.\nDiscussion of Financial Condition\nAverage earning assets were $2.512 billion for the fourth quarter of 2017, an increase of $45.7 million, or 1.9%, over the third quarter of 2017, and an increase of $88.6 million, or 3.7%, over the fourth quarter of 2016. The change in earning assets over both periods reflected a higher level of total deposits.\nWe maintained an average net overnight funds (deposits with banks plus fed funds sold less fed funds purchased) sold position of $174.6 million during the fourth quarter of 2017 compared to an average net overnight funds sold position of $140.7 million in the third quarter of 2017 and $145.5 million in the fourth quarter of 2016. The increase in net overnight funds compared to the prior periods reflected increases in noninterest bearing deposits, partially offset by increases in the loan portfolio and/or the investment portfolio.\nAverage loans increased $2.2 million, or 0.1% when compared to the third quarter of 2017, and have grown $67.5 million, or 4.3% when compared to the fourth quarter of 2016. The average increase compared to the third quarter of 2017 primarily reflected growth in construction and indirect consumer loans, partially offset by a reduction in the remaining loan types. Average growth over the fourth quarter of 2016 was experienced in all loan products, with the exception of commercial loans, home equity loans, and consumer direct loans. A portion of the increase compared to the fourth quarter 2016 was due to strategic loan purchases of approximately $26.8 million in adjustable residential real estate loans and $16.4 million in fixed and adjustable rate commercial real estate loans.\nWe continue to make minor modifications on some of our lending programs to try and mitigate the impact that consumer and business deleveraging has had on our portfolio. These programs, coupled with economic improvements in our anchor markets and strategic loan purchases, have helped to increase overall loan growth.\nNonperforming assets (nonaccrual loans and OREO) totaled $11.1 million at December 31, 2017, a decrease of $1.4 million, or 12%, from September 30, 2017 and $8.1 million, or 42%, from December 31, 2016. Nonaccrual loans totaled $7.2 million at December 31, 2017, a $0.6 million increase over September 30, 2017 and a $1.4 million decrease from December 31, 2016. Nonaccrual loan additions totaled $5.6 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 and $14.1 million for the full year 2017, which compares to $3.9 million and $13.1 million, respectively, for the same periods of 2016. The balance of OREO totaled $3.9 million at December 31, 2017, a decrease of $2.0 million and $6.7 million, respectively, from September 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016. For the fourth quarter of 2017, we added properties totaling $0.4 million, sold properties totaling $2.2 million, and recorded valuation adjustments totaling $0.2 million. For the full year 2017, we added properties totaling $2.4 million, sold properties totaling $7.5 million, recorded valuation adjustments totaling $1.3 million, and miscellaneous adjustments totaling $0.3 million. Nonperforming assets represented 0.38% of total assets at December 31, 2017 compared to 0.45% at September 30, 2017 and 0.67% at December 31, 2016.\nAverage total deposits were $2.378 billion for the fourth quarter of 2017, an increase of $49.2 million, or 2.1%, over the third quarter of 2017, and an increase of $71.5 million, or 3.1% over the fourth quarter of 2016. The increase in deposits when compared to the prior periods reflected growth in all deposit products except money market accounts and certificates of deposit. Average total deposits year-over-year reflected strong growth in noninterest bearing deposits and savings accounts. Deposit levels remain strong, particularly given the increases in the fed funds rate. Average core deposits continue to experience growth. Competitive rates are monitored on an ongoing basis as a prudent pricing discipline remains the key to managing our mix of deposits.\nAverage borrowings decreased $2.5 million compared to the third quarter of 2017, and decreased $9.4 million compared to the fourth quarter 2016. Declines over both prior periods were primarily due to payoffs of FHLB advances.\nShareowners’ equity was $284.4 million at December 31, 2017, compared to $285.2 million at September 30, 2017 and $275.2 million at December 31, 2016. Our leverage ratio was 10.26%, 10.48%, and 10.23%, respectively, for these periods. Further, at December 31, 2017, our risk-adjusted capital ratio was 16.77% compared to 16.96% and 16.28% at September 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016, respectively. Our common equity tier 1 ratio was 13.09% at December 31, 2017, compared to 13.26% at September 30, 2017 and 12.61% at December 31, 2016. All of our capital ratios exceeded the threshold to be designated as “well-capitalized” under the Basel III capital standards. The $4.0 million deferred tax re-measurement adjustment recorded in the fourth quarter of 2017 due to the Tax Act unfavorably impacted our common equity tier 1 and risk-adjusted capital ratio by approximately 26 basis points.\nAbout Capital City Bank Group, Inc.\nCapital City Bank Group, Inc.
