Two other men were injured in the attacks that took place shortly before 0900 GMT, police said.\n“A terror attack is a line of enquiry - it is certainly a line that we would look at,” Chief Superintendent Christy Mangan told a news conference, adding police would be aiming to check the suspect’s background and why he was in Ireland.\nReporting by Padraic Halpin; editing by Stephen Addison\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-01-04T01:35:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-04T08:09:02.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
