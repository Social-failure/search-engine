China is a bright spot for Lego, however, with revenues growing double-digit versus declines in the U.S. and parts of Europe in the first half of 2017, the last time it released financial figures .\nThe toy-maker has been pushing further into China to help stoke growth. Lego will develop a \"video zone\" for children on Tencent's video streaming platform as well as Lego-branded games.\nLego's partnership also includes Lego Boost, a building and coding set that brings movement to its brick creations. The two companies also said they will explore co-developing Lego Life, a \"safe social network for children\" in China.\nThe Danish firm faces competition in China from rivals. Last year, Mattel, the maker of Barbie, announced a deal to sell its products in China via Alibaba's marketplace website Tmall.com.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-15T13:49:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-15T13:49:38.001+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
