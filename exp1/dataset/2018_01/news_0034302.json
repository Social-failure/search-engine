REUTERS/Jonathan Lanza \n“We demand a rectification of these accusations,” the opposition said in a statement, confirming it was pulling out of Thursday’s talks but would be open to future meetings. \nPrevious attempts at talks, including one led by the Vatican, have failed in recent years. \nOpposition leaders are demanding Maduro accept humanitarian assistance from abroad to ease a severe economic crisis that has led to shortages of food and medicines and is also calling for the release of several hundred jailed political activists. \nVenezuelan authorities want the opposition to help pressure for an end to sanctions levied last year by the United States. \nBoth sides are also focused on a presidential election this year, although no date has been set.
