The bank meets all prudential requirements,” the South African Reserve Bank said in a statement. \nViceroy, which did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment, alleged in the report that Capitec overstated its loan book by as much as 3 billion rand ($250 million) a year by issuing new loans to defaulting clients. \nCapitec would need to write off 11 billion rand of its loan book to accurately represent the delinquencies and risks in its portfolio, Viceroy added. \nCapitec said it had only received the report at 0800 GMT on Tuesday and that Viceroy had not discussed any of its claims. \n“I’ve got a concern if a report comes out and there are a lot of inaccuracies and they’re not prepared to talk to us,” Capitec’s chief executive Gerrie Fourie. \n“And when you short a stock and then bring out a report, there is for sure a profit motive but I don’t know their real motives,” Fourie told a news conference in Cape Town. \nViceroy’s Fraser Perring told Bloomberg TV his company has a short position on Capitec’s stock, meaning it could profit from any decline in the share price.
