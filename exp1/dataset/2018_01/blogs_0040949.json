China is arguably the world's best consumption market ... China hosts the largest middle-income crowd, growing very fast, buying things left and right, and that trend continues,\" he added, referring to China's years-long attempt to shift from a manufacturing-led growth model to one anchored by the domestic consumption of products and services.\nAnd while the government's efforts to tackle overcapacity through supply-side reforms were starting to show some positive signs, Zhao reiterated that China's status as the world's largest consumption market was more significant.\n\"The real story about Chinese growth is consumption,\" Zhao said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-24T08:18:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-24T08:29:56.002+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
