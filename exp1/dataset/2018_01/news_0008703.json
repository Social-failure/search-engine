Over the past 12 months, Kiwa Bio-Tech has demonstrated that our market-responsive approach, commitment to research and development and focus on extending longer-term credit to our customers achieved a positive reputation in the agricultural industry. Amidst very promising agricultural market conditions worldwide and with recently implemented governmental policy supports in China, the Company believes 2018 sales and earnings will surpass our 2017 numbers.\nIn addition to record sales and earnings in 2017, Kiwa Bio-Tech took many important steps to build up experimental and demonstration sites in China to promote our innovative fertilizer products. We remain committed to optimizing our product portfolio and will continue to upgrade our agricultural technology to meet market demand.\nOUR PERFORMANCE AND STRATEGY\nPlaying a key role in developing eco-friendly agriculture and delivering long-term value for all of our stakeholders requires strong performance in several areas.\nFirst, I am proud to say that Kiwa Bio-Tech has sold and shipped approximately $19 million of fertilizer products in this year ended December 31, compared to approximately $9.6 million during the same period in 2016, which is an increase of approximately 98%. Achieving this significant growth was due in part to the Company expanding its sales teams and distribution channels in Northwest, Eastern, and Southern China.\nBased on the cooperation between Kiwa Bio-Tech and China Agricultural University, Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences and ETS Research Center of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Kiwa was able to finish product segmentation and apply certain new products to the national soil restoration project.\nKiwa Bio-Tech has also established strategic cooperative relationships with Northwest Agricultural University, Northwestern University, and Harbin Institute of Technology, which provide cutting-edge technology for Kiwa Bio-Tech.\nIn July 2017, Kiwa Bio-Tech made a proposal to establish China’s harmless agriculture standard based on the cooperation with the China Agricultural Products Processing Industry Development Association. The proposal enjoys a high degree of credibility in upgrading the standard system for the harmless agricultural industry and the agricultural products market in China, which we believe provides significant market opportunities for Kiwa Bio-Tech over the next 3 to 5 year term and thereafter.\nPOSITIONED FOR LONG-TERM SUCCESS\n2017 was a year that propelled the company forward, positioned Kiwa Bio-Tech to be successful in very promising market conditions and enhanced our ability to thrive as demand increases for our innovative products. Throughout the year, the Company continued to focus on positioning our company for the future:\nEnhanced Marketing Plan\nKiwa Bio-Tech has established a three-part initiative with respect to planting harmless crops, selling green agricultural products and soil conservation consistent with the standards of the agricultural industry.\nIn 2017, our marketing program was implemented in Shanxi Province, Shandong Province, Hainan Province, and Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region. Due to our proactive marketing campaign, Kiwa Bio-Tech’s products have been used on cash crops including, apples, grapes, kiwi fruit, cantaloupe and vegetables, in green houses in approximately 82,368 planted acres.\nCorporation Development and Expansion\nOur manufacturing base in Penglai, Shandong Province, will soon commence production after the installment of facilities in 2018. When fully operational, the factory will produce approximately 200,000 tons of Kiwa fertilizer products every year.\nWe will establish a new subsidiary company in Yangling, Shaanxi. Yangling is the only Pilot Free Trade Zones with a special focus on agricultural development that epitomizes the development of modern agricultural industry chain. As the agricultural “Silicon Valley” of China, Yangling could attract government incentives, high-tech agricultural companies and logistics companies. Kiwa Bio-Tech’s first strain fermentation manufacturing base will be developed and built in the Pilot Free Trade Zone.\nMeanwhile, we will also gradually establish as many as 1800 experimental and demonstration stations across China to promote our products.\nIncreased Financial Competence and Strategic Cooperation\nKiwa Bio-Tech selected new auditors in the past year that further audited our previous financial reports. We have also hired additional financial consultants to improve Kiwa Bio-Tech’s ongoing financial competence.\nOf significant importance, Kiwa Bio-Tech has signed a strategic agreement with the Beijing Jingnong Public Welfare Foundation. A major highlight of the agreement is the selection of Kiwa Bio-Tech as the technical support company to address the issue of polluted soil in Mainland China.\nGrowing Market\nKiwa Bio-Tech also announced a cooperative venture with China Association of Traditional Chinese Medicine, where the association will apply our core technology and products to the development of the Safety Standards of Chinese Traditional Medicine Planting.\nIn 2018, we expect the Company will significantly increase its share of the Chinese agricultural market. Kiwa Bio-Tech also looks to growth through entry into the soil restoration market.\nKiwa Bio-Tech achieved tremendous success in 2017, and we believe that the Company is well positioned for 2018 and beyond. Our progress and financial success could not have happened without our employees. I offer my personal thanks for their valuable contributions to our company. As a leader in China for developing the environmentally friendly harmless agriculture industry, we believe that Kiwa Bio-Tech is uniquely positioned to build value for our shareholders and make an enduring contribution to a safer and healthier world.\nWe plan to make 2018 a great year!\nYvonne Wang\nChief Executive Officer\nJanuary 8, 2018\nThis letter contains information that constitutes forward-looking statements made pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.
