The mean full-year estimate in Reuters’ latest poll of analysts, ahead of third-quarter results, was for 1.68 billion.\n“The decline in earnings is primarily attributable to operations in Stockholm where the market was weak in the quarter, and costs were not fully adjusted in line with the weaker like-for-like sales development,” it said in a statement.\nShares were down 18.4 percent at 94.20 crowns by 0932 GMT, their lowest level since April 2017.\nScandic Hotels said it saw adjusted EBITDA in Sweden shrinking to around 200 million crowns from 264 million in the quarter, while in other markets earnings had remained positive.\nIncentive programmes and other one-off staff costs would also weigh on results, it added.\n$1 = 8.0315 Swedish crowns Reporting by Anna Ringstrom, editing by Louise Heavens\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-01-16T17:57:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-17T20:08:09.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
