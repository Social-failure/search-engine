Only about one quarter of all students receive financial aid.\nBut making early withdrawals could also forfeit the benefit from long-term compounding, and college is still significantly more expensive than grade school. (While 529 balances have been growing, so are college costs.)\nAll in, families with students in four-year private colleges spent almost $47,000 in 2017–18; that's up 3.5 percent from the year earlier, according to the College Board . In college about two-thirds of all full-time students receive aid.\nMary Morris, chair emeritus of the College Savings Foundation and CEO of Virginia529, one of the country's largest 529 programs, said she noted immediate interest in the new rules among plan contributors, some of whom have already made distributions to pay for K–12 tuition.\n\"I'm hoping people will use this as yet another tool, leaving more in for the long term than the short term.\" -Mary Morris, chair emeritus of the College Savings Foundation In Virginia, there is no holding period, so participants can deposit money into an account, claim their state's tax deduction and then take up to $10,000 out to pay their tuition bills.\n\"For now, there is no holding requirement,\" Morris said. \"If we see a lot of money moving through quickly, that might change in the future.\"\nHowever, Morris is optimistic about the new law and the renewed interest in savings plans. \"I'm hoping people will use this as yet another tool, leaving more in for the long term than the short term,\" she said.\n\"Ultimately, I trust our families to figure out what works for them.\"\nMore from Your Money, Your Future: \nBig mistake: Choosing a college savings plan based solely on state tax breaks \nHere's a new tax bill provision that will help you save on school expenses \n10 states where you can stretch your 529 on private-school costs", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-22T15:57:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-22T16:31:03.020+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
