All airports were back online after wait times for travelers that were longer than usual, it said.\n\"At this time, there is no indication the service disruption was malicious in nature,\" the agency said. It gave no explanation for the disruption and said travelers were processed using alternative procedures.\nTravelers entering the United States from overseas posted photos on social media of long lines at John F. Kennedy International Airport in New York and at Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport.\n\"No one has been getting past JFK Airport immigration for the last hour. Line is a few 100 deep. Seems like their system did completely go down. Happy New Year!\" said Jessica Yang, a programme manager at Microsoft, in a Twitter post.\nOther airports, including Denver International Airport, also said they were affected. A similar computer outage occurred a year ago.\n\"Operations returning to normal as @CustomsBorder computer issue resolved. Issue affected other US airports. Thanks for your patience,\" Miami International Airport said in a Twitter post.\nTweet 1", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-02T09:11:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-02T09:11:59.019+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
