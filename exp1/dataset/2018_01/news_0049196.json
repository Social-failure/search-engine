So that was the end of our race, probably. Then we had a throttle issue and then again a brake issue.” \nEven the champions had their share of problems with Albuquerque, who drove the final portion of the race, unable to push hard out of fear of overheating. \nAnother Cadillac team with Mike Conway, Eric Curran, Felipe Nasr and Stuart Middleton took second. \nNinth place went to Ricky Taylor, Helio Castroneves and Graham Rahal with Juan Pablo Montoya, Simon Pagenaud and Dane Cameron taking 10th \nThe day was a special one for Chip Ganassi Racing, which posted its 200th career victory across four different motorsports disciplines, including NASCAR and IndyCar, to claim the GT Le Mans class. \nRyan Briscoe, Richard Westbrook, and Scott Dixon drove the winning car, taking the class victory over fellow Ganassi drivers Joey Hand, Dirk Mueller and Sebastien Bourdais.
