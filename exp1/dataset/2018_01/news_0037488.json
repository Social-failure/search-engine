I am still learning and still improving, I believe, so for my personal reasons, as well, I think it’s the right place to be,” Dyche told the club’s official website (www.burnleyfootballclub.com). \n“It’s a very good environment and I enjoy it and I enjoy the connection I’ve had with this area. There’s lots of work to be done, but I‘m definitely ‘in’ for the work to be done.” \nWhile the club did not give any financial details of the new deal, the Lancashire Evening Telegraph said that Dyche would be earning 3.5 million pounds a year. \nA former lower division defender, Dyche joined Burnley after spending just over a year in charge of Watford. \nDyche added to his squad on Tuesday by signing winger Aaron Lennon from Everton.
