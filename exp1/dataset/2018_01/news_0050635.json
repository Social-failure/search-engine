China carried out its first nuclear weapons test only in 1964.\nTrump’s strong embrace of his predecessor President Barack Obama’s nuclear modernization program has led some former senior U.S. government officials, legislators and arms control specialists to warn of risks from the U.S. stoking a new arms race.\nA U.S. national defense strategy released on Jan. 19 shifted priorities to put what Defense Secretary Jim Mattis called a “great power competition” with China and Russia at the heart of the country’s military strategy.\nReporting by Christian Shepherd; Editing by Clarence Fernandez\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-30T12:18:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-30T12:31:27.008+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
