The U.S. is watching!” \nThe sanctions threat from the White House comes ahead of a congressional deadline Trump will face this month on whether to certify that Iran is meeting the terms of a nuclear agreement with the U.S. and other nations. Trump, who has criticized the agreement, in October declined to re-certify the deal but held off on reimposing certain sanctions. A new wave of sanctions risks killing the nuclear agreement.
