(the “Company”) (NASDAQ:FCAP), the holding company for First Harrison Bank (the “Bank”), today reported net income of $7.4 million, or $2.23 per diluted share, for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to net income $6.9 million, or $2.05 per diluted share, for the year ended December 31, 2016.\nThe increase in net income is primarily due to increases in net interest income after provision for loan losses and noninterest income partially offset increases in noninterest expenses and income tax expense.\nThe federal tax reform legislation signed into law on December 22, 2017 resulted in the Company recognizing an additional $290,000 in income tax expense during 2017. Excluding this additional expense, the Company would have reported net income for 2017 of $7.7 million, or $2.32 per diluted share, for the year ended December 31, 2017.\nNet interest income after provision for loan losses increased $1.4 million for 2017 as compared to 2016. Interest income increased $1.3 million when comparing the two periods due to increases in the average balance of interest-earning assets from $685.0 million for 2016 to $708.4 million for 2017 and the average tax-equivalent yield of interest-earning assets from 3.76% for 2016 to 3.84% for 2017. Interest expense decreased $371,000 when comparing the periods as the average cost of interest-bearing liabilities decreased from 0.33% to 0.26% which more than offset an increase in the average balance of interest-bearing liabilities from $531.1 million for 2016 to $541.5 million for 2017. The decrease in the average cost of funds is primarily due to repricing of savings and interest-bearing demand deposit accounts acquired in the Company’s December 2015 acquisition of Peoples Bancorp, Inc. of Bullitt County and its wholly-owned subsidiary Peoples Bank of Bullitt County (collectively, “Peoples”). As a result of the changes in interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities, the interest rate spread increased from 3.43% for 2016 to 3.58% for 2017.\nBased on management’s analysis of the allowance for loan losses, the provision for loan losses increased from $645,000 for 2016 to $915,000 for 2017. The Bank recognized net charge-offs of $674,000 for 2016 compared to $667,000 for 2017.\nNoninterest income increased $529,000 for 2017 as compared to 2016 primarily due to increases in service charges and fees on deposit accounts and gains on the sale of loans $466,000 and $206,000, respectively, partially offset by a $122,000 decrease in gains on the sale of securities.\nNoninterest expenses increased $803,000 for 2017 compared to 2016 primarily due to increases in compensation and benefits expense of $717,000 and data processing expense of $286,000 when comparing the two periods. This was partially offset by decreases of $155,000 in professional fees and $141,000 in other operating expenses.\nThe Company’s net income was $1.6 million, or $0.48 per diluted share, for the quarter ended December 31, 2017 compared to $1.7 million, or $0.52 per diluted share, for the quarter ended December 31, 2016. Excluding the additional $290,000 of income tax expense related to the 2017 federal tax reform legislation discussed above, the Company would have reported net income of $1.9 million, or $0.56 per diluted share, for the quarter ended December 31, 2017.\nNet interest income after provision for loan losses increased $500,000 for the quarter ended December 31, 2017 as compared to the same period in 2016. Interest income increased $529,000 when comparing the two periods, due to an increase in the average tax-equivalent yield on earning assets from 3.66% for the quarter ended December 31, 2016 to 3.95% for the same period in 2017. The average balance of interest-earning assets also increased, from $700.3 million for 2016 to $706.3 million for 2017. Interest expense decreased $49,000 as the average balance of interest-bearing liabilities decreased from $541.5 million for the quarter ended December 31, 2016 to $538.3 million for the same period in 2017 and the average cost of interest-bearing liabilities decreased from 0.29% for the quarter ended December 31, 2016 to 0.26% for the same period in 2017. The provision for loan losses was $298,000 for the quarter ended December 31, 2017 compared to $220,000 for the quarter ended December 31, 2016.\nNoninterest income increased $205,000 for the quarter ended December 31, 2017 as compared to the same period in 2016, primarily due to increases of $146,000 in service charges and fees on deposit accounts and $67,000 in gains on the sale of loans.\nNoninterest expenses increased $557,000 for the quarter ended December 31, 2017 as compared to the quarter ended December 31, 2016, primarily due to increases of $459,000 in compensation and benefit expense and $112,000 in net loss on foreclosed real estate. This was partially offset by decreases of $51,000 in professional fees and $33,000 in occupancy and equipment expense.\nTotal assets at December 31, 2017 were $759.0 million compared to $743.7 million at December 31, 2016. Net loans receivable and investment securities increased $28.5 million and $15.4 million, respectively. This growth was funded by a decrease of $20.0 million in cash and cash equivalents and an increase of $10.0 million in Federal Home Loan Bank advances. Total deposits were relatively unchanged, decreasing $88,000 during 2017, but noninterest-bearing deposits increased from $121.3 million at December 31, 2016 to $129.8 million at December 31, 2017. Nonperforming assets (consisting of nonaccrual loans, accruing loans 90 days or more past due, troubled debt restructurings on accrual status, and foreclosed real estate) decreased from $8.4 million at December 31, 2016 to $7.7 million at December 31, 2017 as management continues to work to resolve nonperforming assets acquired from Peoples.\nAt December 31, 2017, the Bank was considered well-capitalized under applicable federal regulatory capital guidelines.\nThe Bank currently has eighteen offices in the Indiana communities of Corydon, Edwardsville, Greenville, Floyds Knobs, Palmyra, New Albany, New Salisbury, Jeffersonville, Salem, Lanesville and Charlestown and the Kentucky communities of Shepherdsville, Mt. Washington and Lebanon Junction.\nAccess to First Harrison Bank accounts, including online banking and electronic bill payments, is available through the Bank’s website at www.firstharrison.com .
