That is down from 10.7 million bales produced in the 2016/17 marketing year.\nThe forecast is down because of an infestation of the pink bollworm that has cut yields.\nThe drop in the output could lift local prices and reduce the exports from India, the world’s biggest cotton producer, during the 2017/18 marketing year.\n“As harvesting started, farmers realised the impact of the pink boll worm pest on the crop. Yield were substantially lower than normal,” said the official, who declined to be named as the estimate has not been published.\nMaharashtra usually accounts for over a quarter of the India’s production, which the government has estimated at 37.7 million bales for the current marketing year.\nThe reduction in Maharashtra’s production will slash the country’s output and keep prices firm in the local market, said Pradip Jain, owner of cotton trader Mahavir Ginning and Pressing.\nCotton prices have surged 12 percent in the past eight weeks as spot markets were getting lower-than-normal supplies from the new season crop.\nIndia’s cotton exports could fall to 5 million bales, nearly a quarter below earlier estimates, said Atul Ganatra, president of Cotton Association of India.\nPink bollworms consume the cotton fibre and seeds inside the boll, or fruit, of the plant and cut the amount of fibre harvested.\n1 Indian bale = 170 kg Reporting by Rajendra Jadhav; Editing by Christian Schmollinger\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-01-24T18:25:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-25T12:59:51.004+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
