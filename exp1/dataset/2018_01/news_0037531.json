Another link IFA2, is under construction and expected to be complete by 2020. \nGlukhovskoy said Aquind’s cable and three other planned private power cables across the Channel were responding to demand for power interconnectors, and would increase competition in the power market and improve security of supply. \n“What we see clearly is that the asset will be used very well,” he said. \n($1 = 0.8143 euros)", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-23T19:49:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-23T20:11:27.005+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
