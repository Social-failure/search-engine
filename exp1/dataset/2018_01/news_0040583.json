They are more common in southern South America and are now very rare in Ecuador and Venezuela.\nVanesa Astore, executive director of the Condor Conservation project, said condors take a long time to mature and are slow to breed, making the poisoning of adults particularly devastating. One of the largest flying birds in the world, condors can live for about 70 years.\n“This really puts conservationists on alert,” she said. “It could lead to the extinction of the species.”\nReporting by Miguel Lobianco; Writing and additional reporting by Caroline Stauffer; Editing by Lisa Von Ahn\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-25T20:47:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-25T21:06:39.029+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
