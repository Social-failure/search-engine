It was Los Angeles’ sixth consecutive loss.\nJohn Gibson made 23 saves for the Ducks, while Jonathan Quick stopped 29 of 31 shots in his second game in as many nights.\nAfter a contentious meeting on Saturday night which saw the teams engage in three fights during a four-second span early in the first period of Anaheim’s 4-2 win, they mostly left excessive testosterone out of the equation for the rematch.\nThey were cited for just three minor penalties, including none in the third period, while still playing their usual physical style. The one time things threatened to boil over with 6:02 remaining after a Gibson save, the officials jumped in quickly and got things under control.\nThe Ducks enjoyed a clear territorial edge in the first period with a 17-5 advantage in shots on goal, but Quick stood tall and kept the game scoreless. Los Angeles got more zone time in the second period and earned a 10-8 edge in shots on net, but couldn’t crack Gibson.\nFinally, Anaheim’s Adam Henrique broke the scoring seal just 2:05 into the third period with his 11th goal of the season. Ondrej Kase tried a slapper from the right circle that was blocked before it got to Quick, but Henrique got to the loose puck and barely nudged it over the goal line with Christian Folin draped all over him.\nThe Kings equalized at 4:48 with Alex Iafallo’s third goal of the season. Gibson made the initial save on Jake Muzzin’s wrister from the left point, but Iafallo was left unmarked at the post and chipped the rebound over Gibson.\n--Field Level Media\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-01-20T14:07:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-21T13:24:42.027+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
