And pieces of it were broken up and kept by the loyal sailors who had lost their very, very deeply loved commander.” \nThe last surviving complete Union Jack flag flown at the battle fetched 384,000 pounds in 2009, more than twenty times its estimated price. \nThe battle of Trafalgar was a naval clash that took place in 1805, and saw the British defeat a numerically superior French and Spanish fleet. Nelson was fatally wounded during the battle, which cemented his status as a national hero in Britain. \n($1 = 0.7230 pounds)", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-18T10:38:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-18T10:58:44.048+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
