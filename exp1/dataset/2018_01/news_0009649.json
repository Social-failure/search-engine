I have decided to give it (marriage) a go again, not only because I believe I have found the man I was meant to be with, but because I have accepted the soul-stretching, pattern-breaking opportunities that (terrifyingly) are made possible by intimacy,” she said. \nPaltrow and Falchuk, 46, have been dating for about two years. Falchuk was the co-creator with Ryan Murphy in 2009 of the popular TV series “Glee.” The two also worked together on the TV series “American Horror Story” and “Scream Queens.” \nPaltrow won a best actress Oscar in 1999 for “Shakespeare in Love,” but is now better known as the creator of Goop, a lifestyle website and product store that promotes healthy eating and stress-free living. \nShe and Martin finalised their divorce in 2016 after 13 years of marriage. They have two children. \nPaltrow and Falchuk posed for the cover of the magazine with his arms wrapped around her. Falchuk also answered the popular “How goopy are you?” quiz in a video on goop.com. The interview appears in the issue of Goop that hits newsstands on Tuesday.
