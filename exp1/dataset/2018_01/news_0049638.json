The minimum levels to be considered well-capitalized for each of these ratios are 10.0%, 8.0%, 6.5%, and 5.0%, respectively.\nIn addition, the Company announced today that its Board of Directors voted to declare an annual dividend based on 2017 earnings of $.17 per share for stockholders of record on January 26, 2018 with payment to be made on February 12, 2018.\nCommenting on the year end results, Mr. Keen, President and CEO of the Company and the Bank, stated, “These results represent another successful year for the Company, as we continue to implement management’s plan to maximize shareholder value by increasing income-producing assets, while controlling expenses. Without the one-time tax adjustment, earnings would have been at record levels. We expect reduced tax expense in future periods to more than offset this one-time charge. On behalf of the Board of Directors and our management team, I would like to thank our customers and the local communities for their continued support as we look forward to continuing to serve them as their independent community bank of choice.”\nKS Bancorp, Inc. is a Smithfield, North Carolina-based single bank holding company.
