In addition, bad weather last year caused the lowest French harvest in 30 years.\n“Never before has such a difficult situation lasted so long,” AGPB Chairman Philippe Pinta told reporters, adding that 40 percent of French grain growers had lost money last year.\n“What we can act on to regain competitiveness are costs,” he said. “In the medium term, our objective is to be competitive at a wheat selling price of 140 euros ($171) per tonne, which would still give farmers an income.”\nBut he said this could take 10 years because savings were required in so many areas.\nFrench growers currently produce wheat at around 175 euros ($214) a tonne, but have been selling at around 130-135 euros, Pinta said.\nLogistics will be one of the main ways to improve French wheat’s competitiveness, he said. He urged the government to improve rail freight, which was cheaper than the roads, and said better transport could knock 5-10 euros off the price of a tonne of wheat.\nHe also asked for lower taxes, after Agriculture Minister Stephane Travert this week announced a review of farm taxation.
