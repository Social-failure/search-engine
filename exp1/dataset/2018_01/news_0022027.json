He added it would focus on the area around the medieval Islamic city of Mopti on the Niger river. Some 200 troops from neighboring Senegal would join the operation.\nSenegalese army spokesman Abdoul Ndiaye confirmed that Senegalese troops were already being deployed for this offensive -- many were in Mali anyway on U.N. peacekeeping duties -- though he declined to give the precise number.\nIslamist groups have for more than a decade destabilized the sparsely populated desert north, but in the past three years they have exploited conflicts between Fulani cattle herders and farmers in Mali’s wetter, more populated center.\nThat has shifted the battlefield closer to the richer south and capital Bamako, a fact highlighted by a string of attacks blamed on Fulani Islamist fighters from central Mali -- most spectacularly one on the Radisson Blu hotel in Bamako in November 2015 that killed dozens of people.\nReporting by Tiemoko Diallo in Bamako and Diadie Ba in Dakar; Writing by Tim Cocks, Editing by William Maclean\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-01-13T01:09:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-13T14:55:37.040+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
