If we all take a longer-term view to investing and investing in infrastructure, it will actually make the world a better place.\"\nGilbert says his company's average holding time on an equity is 10 years.\nWith around $900 billion consolidated assets under management, Standard Life Aberdeen is Europe's second-largest fund manager following last year's $14.8 billion merger between Standard Life and Aberdeen Asset Management.\nJason Alden | Bloomberg via Getty Images Martin Gilbert, chief executive officer of Aberdeen Asset Management Plc, speaks during an interview in London, U.K., on Monday, May 16, 2016. Global markets have been rallying as of late, but Gilbert said he's anticipating a correction.\n\"I'm not sure we're going to get a serious fall because the global economy is pretty benign at the moment, but there is too much complacency. The market isn't pricing in any shocks.\"\nIf U.S. inflation increases at a faster-than-expected clip, that could cause the Federal Reserve to tighten faster, he warned.\nThe world's largest economy \"is surprising on the upside,\" but it's not clear how much of that is due to President Donald Trump's policies, Gilbert continued. The corporate tax cut , however, was definitely a positive move, he added.\nCloser to home, the fund manager said the U.K. government was in \"a tough spot\" amid ongoing Brexit negotiations . Officials at 10 Downing Street \"probably didn't realize\" the sheer importance of financial services to the U.K. economy, Gilbert said.\nIn the case of a so-called hard Brexit, parts of the industry could migrate to New York or Singapore , according to the executive, who added that \"Dublin could be a big winner as well.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-23T07:19:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-23T07:21:15.014+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
