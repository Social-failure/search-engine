Prime Minister Zoran Zaev did not say what its new name would be. \nGreece insists the country be referred to internationally as the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia until the row is resolved. That is the name under which it was admitted to the United Nations in 1993. \n“To demonstrate, in practice, that we are committed to finding a solution, I am announcing that we will change the name of the airport and avenues,” Zaev told reporters at the World Economic Forum in Davos, in comments translated into Greek. \nZaev said the final solution “should be accepted by both sides, and promote the interests of both.” \nThe two sides had agreed to intensify consultations which are already underway, Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras said. \n“We don’t want to just solve the issue of the name, but to put the relations of our two countries on solid foundations,” he said. \nThe dispute has held up the country’s prospects of joining the European Union and NATO. \nGreeks are highly sensitive about the issue. Hundreds of thousands of people demonstrated in northern Greece on Sunday against any solution that would include the term “Macedonia.” \n“The majority of citizens in both countries want close relations and mutual cooperation. We want to be partners in the EU, and in NATO,” Zaev said.
