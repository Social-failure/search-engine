He said he hopes the Justice Department reconsiders its decision to retry the senator.\nA Justice Department spokeswoman said prosecutors were reviewing the court order and considering their next steps.\nThe first trial, which lasted more than two months, ended in a mistrial when the jury in Newark, New Jersey, could not come to a unanimous verdict on any count.\nA new trial date has not been set.\nThe prospect of a second trial during a campaign year has not deterred the state’s prominent Democrats, including U.S. Senator Cory Booker and newly elected Governor Phil Murphy, from continuing to back Menendez. He currently faces no serious opponent for the Democratic nomination.\nReporting by Joseph Ax\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-25T00:19:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-25T00:32:30.029+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
