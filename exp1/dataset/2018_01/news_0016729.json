The index was down 0.94 percent, after slipping to a four-month low of 90.954. \nThe dollar index was down 1.23 percent for the year, its worst performance over the first nine trading days since 2010, according to Reuters data. \n“The latest ECB comments were a bit on the hawkish side, so that’s giving more life to the euro,” said Minh Trang, senior currency trader at Silicon Valley Bank in Santa Clara, California. \nSterling rocketed to its highest level against the dollar since the vote to leave the European Union after a report that the Netherlands and Spain were open to a deal for Britain to remain as close as possible to the trading bloc. Sterling was last trading at $1.373, up 1.43 percent. \nU.S. stock indexes hit all-time highs, along with the MSCI world index. Strong U.S December retail sales data also helped stocks. \nThe S&P financial index was up 0.6 percent. While tax-related costs are expected to weigh on banks’ earnings, they are expected to benefit in the long run from a lower tax burden.
