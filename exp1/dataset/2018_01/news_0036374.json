He was confident that his game - and body - was heading in the right direction. \n“You have to beat balls for a little bit of time to build up your endurance and muscles. I feel like I’ve done that and now it’s time to play a tournament,” he said. \nWoods, who has barely played in three years due to a serious back injury, returned after a 10-month absence when he took part in the unofficial Hero World Challenge, finishing a respectable ninth out of 18 players and swinging with apparent freedom. \n“I’ve had a little more time to get ready for this event,” he said. “I’ve played a lot more golf and overall I feel like I’ve made some nice changes. I feel good.” \nWoods, 42, will play the first two rounds with fellow Americans Patrick Reed and Charley Hoffman. \nHe hardly needs a practice round at Torrey Pines to know his way around. He has won on eight occasions here, seven times at the PGA Tour event and most notably at the 2008 U.S. Open. \nThat 14th major title was perhaps his greatest achievement, coming as it did as he carried multiple leg injuries. \nFew thought at the time that nearly 10 years later he would not have added to his major haul. \nThe U.S. Open was played on Torrey Pines’ South Course, while the Farmers uses the South for three rounds while one round is contested on the easier North Course. \nTwo years ago Woods gingerly limped off the course after playing just 11 holes of the first round, a week after shooting a career-worst 82 at the Phoenix Open. \nHe returned last year but missed the cut, before playing one round at the European Tour’s Dubai Desert Classic and withdrawing due to back spasms. \nSoon afterwards, with multiple microdiscectomy surgeries seemingly having failed, Woods decided to have a spinal fusion operation last April in an attempt to reduce his searing back pain and allow him to play golf again. \nHe will get a look at the North Course on Wednesday in the pro-am. \nWoods has won 79 times on the PGA Tour, second only to Sam Snead’s 82.
