The incident has been reported to the police and an investigation has begun, the company said.\nReporting by Tanisha Heiberg; Editing by Ed Stoddard and Susan Fenton\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-01-11T22:44:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-11T16:56:35.012+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
