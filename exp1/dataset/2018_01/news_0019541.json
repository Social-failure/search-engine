Everyone is freaking out in the hotel,” Steve Wheatcroft tweeted at 8.14 A.M. local time (1814 GMT). \nAnother player, J.J. Spaun, took refuge in his hotel basement. \n“Barely any service. Can you send confirmed message over radio or tv,” he said in a tweet at 8.26 A.M. \nTwo minutes after that, John Peterson revealed the evasive steps he had taken. \n“Under mattresses in the bathtub with my wife, baby and in laws. Please lord let this bomb threat not be real,” tweeted Peterson, who was tied for second place halfway through the tournament. \nPeterson and Spaun evidently took longer than Justin Thomas to receive word the warning had been sent out by mistake. \n“To all that just received the warning along with me this morning ... apparently it was a ‘mistake’ - hell of a mistake!! Haha glad to know we’ll all be safe,” Thomas, the defending champion and world number four, tweeted at the same time as Spaun. \nThe third round started on time at Waialae Country Club.
