She followed that up with a gold and silver medal a year later in Aspen. \nJust weeks before her injury Sildaru competed in her first World Cup event, having previously been too young to compete, and won the slopestyle competition. \nSince her injury, Sildaru has chronicled her recovery on various social media platforms. Her 62,000 Facebook followers are treated to photographs and video blogs detailing every stage of the rehabilitation process. \nDespite the crushing disappointment of missing out on Pyeongchang next month, she is consistently optimistic about her future. \n“Problems are not stop signs, they are guidelines,” she wrote in a caption to one of her photos on Instagram. \nIn another from November, she wrote, “Happiness is a direction, not a place.” \nAt 15, Sildaru has plenty of time to appear at the Olympics and try to add to Estonia’s seven Winter Games medals, all won in cross country skiing. She will still be a teenager when Beijing 2022 rolls around.
