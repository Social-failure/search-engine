The administration’s has slashed spending on subsidies for utilities and transportation, helping lower the deficit but contributing to inflation, which ended the year well above the central bank’s target for 12-17 percent.\nGovernment revenue rose 22.6 percent, as an economic expansion boosted tax revenue.\nThe South American country’s 2018 budget bill had changed the estimated 2017 primary fiscal deficit, which does not include debt service payments, to 4.0 percent. In the month of December, Argentina posted a primary deficit of 119.607 billion Argentine pesos ($6.35 billion), Dujovne said.\nThe total financial deficit rose 32 percent to 629.1 billion pesos ($33.37 billion) for full-year 2017 on the back of a 71 percent increase in interest payments.
