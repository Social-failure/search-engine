There are no U.S. Food and Drug Administration-approved drugs to cure the condition, but it can be managed with treatments available in the market. \n“We have always recognized that PAH is a complex disease and that this was a translational program,” Chief Executive David Cory said. \nThe company would now focus on its lead program to treat Hepatitis D, Cory said. It has two drugs in mid-stage development for the condition. \nJefferies analyst Maury Raycroft viewed the company’s other programs such as its hepatitis D as more valuable and “de-risked.” \nEiger said it would continue testing ubenimex for lymphedema, or swelling in the arms and legs due to a blockage. \nData from a mid-stage trial in lymphedema is expected in the second half of the year, the company said. \nCory said the company had cash on hand to last until the middle of 2019. The company had cash and cash equivalents of $32.3 million as of Sept. 30, 2017, according to its third-quarter earnings report. \nEiger’s shares were trading down 45.6 percent at $8.87 in morning trading on Tuesday.
