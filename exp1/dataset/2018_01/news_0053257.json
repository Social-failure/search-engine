He is an eminently qualified candidate for this role.” (Reporting by Conor Humphries, writing by Padraic Halpin, Editing by William Maclean)\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-01-30T23:19:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-31T16:12:10.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
