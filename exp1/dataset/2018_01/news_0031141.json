The North will also send 24 officials and 21 media representatives. \nNorth Korea’s planned involvement in Pyeongchang is viewed as a sign of easing tensions over its nuclear and missile programme. \nThe IOC said that the united Korean delegation would be led into the Olympic Stadium for the opening ceremony under the Korean Unification Flag which would be carried by two athletes, one from each country. International Olympic Committee (IOC) President Thomas Bach speaks to the press after a meeting with the National Olympic Committee (NOC) of the Republic of Korea (ROK), the NOC of the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea (DPRK), and a delegation from the PyeongChang 2018 Organising Committee (POCOG) at the IOC headquarters in Lausanne, Switzerland, January 20, 2018. REUTERS/Pierre Albouy \nThe three sports in which North Korea will compete are ice skating and skiing in addition to women’s ice hockey, the IOC said. \nUntil Saturday, a figure skating pair were the only North Koreans to have secured a spot at the Games. \n”Today marks the milestone on a long journey,“ said IOC president Thomas Bach in a prepared declaration. ”Since 2014, the IOC has addressed the special situation of having the Olympic Winter Games on the Korean peninsula. \n“Such an agreement would have seemed impossible only a few weeks ago,” he added. “The Olympic Winter Games are hopefully opening the door to a brighter future on the Korean peninsula.” Writing by Brian Homewood; Editing by John O'Brien and John Stonestreet", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-20T14:33:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-20T14:52:42.038+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
