Analysts at Brazilian bank BTG Pactual said the market had expected a settlement of $5 billion to $10 billion. \nPetrobras preferred shares ticked up nearly 1 percent to 16.71 reais. U.S.-traded shares were up 1.78 percent at $10.89. \nMoody's brushed off concerns about the impact of the fine on the company's balance sheet, noting it was expected to generate some $30 billion in cash this year and make capital investments of around $15 billion. \n\"Petrobras' liquidity position is adequate and the payment of the agreed class action settlement amount is not a material concern,\" it said. \nJeremy Lieberman, an attorney for the investors, called the deal an \"excellent result\" and said it was the largest ever involving a foreign securities issuer in the country. \nThe deal came as the U.S. Supreme Court was set to consider on Jan. 5 whether to hear Petrobras' appeal of a lower court decision certifying the case as a class action. Petrobras said it and the investors would ask the Supreme Court to put off considering the case while the settlement awaits approval. \nIf the Supreme Court does take the case, it could delay its resolution for years. \nU.S. District Judge Jed Rakoff in Manhattan must still approve the accord. \nInvestors had sued Petrobras after prosecutors in Brazil accused executives of accepting more than $2 billion in bribes over a decade, mainly from construction and engineering companies. \nPetrobras claimed it was a victim, and denied wrongdoing in a securities filing on Wednesday. But its market value has plunged as its central role in the scheme continues to be unwound by investigators. \nPetrobras said it hoped the settlement would resolve all investor claims in the United States, though some claims involving non-U.S.-based Petrobras securities purchased outside the United States still remain. \nThe deal came days after Brazil's securities regulator CVM formally accused eight former Petrobras executives of corruption. \nThe accusations relate to possible irregularities in the contracting process for three drilling ships, according to a legal filing by the regulator last Friday. \nAmong the accused in CVM's filing are former Petrobras Chief Executives Maria das Gracas Foster and Jose Sergio Gabrielli. Neither could be reached for comment. \nThe largest securities fraud settlements in U.S. history include $7.2 billion stemming from the collapse of Enron, $6.2 billion over an accounting scandal at WorldCom and $3.2 billion over an accounting scandal at Tyco International, according to Stanford Law School's Securities Class Action Clearinghouse.
