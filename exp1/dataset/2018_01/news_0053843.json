Steinhoff has since admitted “accounting irregularities”, triggering an 85 percent share slide. \nBy 0908 GMT, Capitec stock had dropped 12.6 percent to 826.81 rand, paring some losses after slumping to a low of 755.00 and lagging far behind a 1.9 percent drop in the Johannesburg blue-chip Top-40 index. \n“Based on our research and due diligence, we believe that Capitec is a loan shark with massively understated defaults masquerading as a community microfinance provider,” Viceroy Research said in a report. \n“We believe that the South African Reserve Bank & Minister of Finance should immediately place Capitec into curatorship.” \nCapitec said on its Twitter feed that it had taken note of Viceroy’s report and that it would “respond appropriately”. \nCapitec’s Chief Financial Officer Andre du Plessis told Bloomberg TV the allegations were “totally unfounded.” \n“It’s very surprising that someone writes a report who knows nothing about us. There’s a total lack of understanding of what we do,” du Plessis said.
