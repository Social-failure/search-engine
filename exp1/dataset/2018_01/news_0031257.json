These secondary stock sales will be completed by the end of the day Thursday on the Nasdaq Private market, an Uber spokesman said. \nThe investor group has also completed a $1.25 billion investment of fresh cash at the other, higher valuation, the spokesman said. \nIn all, the investors will take a 17.5 percent stake in Uber, with SoftBank keeping 15 percent, becoming the company’s largest shareholder, people familiar with the deal said. The investment also triggers a number of governance changes at Uber, including the addition of new board members.
