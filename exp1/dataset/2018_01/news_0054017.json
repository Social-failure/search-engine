Palo Alto Networks declined to comment. \nInterest in the resolutions, Kron said, “Crested at the end of the year with the MeToo tidal wave, and I think it’s carrying through” into the 2018 spring proxy season. \nLast spring similar resolutions got around 30 percent support of votes cast, like one at First Republic Bank ( FRC.N ) that got 33 percent support and which Trillium has refiled for this year. \nA bank spokesman declined to comment on Trillium’s resolution. He said of the bank’s top 58 executives, more than half are women. \nExecutives across all industries are taking stock of an ongoing national debate on sexual harassment driven by what is known as the “#MeToo movement” on social media. Dozens of powerful men in politics, entertainment and business have been fired or resigned in the face of allegations they abused their power. \nThe U.S. Government Accountability Office said in November that while the representation of women and minorities in most parts of finance rose from 2007 to 2015, the gains were not even.

Though not required to make the data public, technology leaders and a number of top banks have done so or released detailed summaries including JPMorgan Chase & Co ( JPM.N ), Citigroup Inc ( C.N ), Bank of America Corp ( BAC.N ) and Wells Fargo & Co ( WFC.N ).

REUTERS/Brian Snyder/File Photo \nThe figures do not always show progress. JPMorgan said women accounted for 24.7 percent of its top ranks in 2016, versus 25.8 percent in 2015. \nAsked about the figures, JPMorgan spokesman Andrew Gray said women make up nearly half the bank’s 11-member operating committee and half of the direct reports of CEO Jamie Dimon. Gray said that “we strive every day to foster diversity and a workplace environment of respect and trust.” \nEven if change is slow, investors and recruiters say the details can be useful as a measure of a company’s concerns. \n“You are going to see more and more investors wanting to screen out those companies” that can’t show a diverse workforce, said Victoria Fernandez, managing director at Crossmark Global Investments. \nAlthough they have released diversity data, the major banks so far have not released detailed breakdowns of how women and minorities are paid within job categories. \nUnder pressure from Arjuna shareholder proposals, Citigroup and Bank of America each said this month that on average they pay women 99 percent of what they pay men in the United States and in other countries. \nArjuna Managing Partner Natasha Lamb said she would still like to see the banks release pay measures broken down by job level. Arjuna is still seeking pay ratio details from other banks this spring including Wells Fargo. \nOne goal is to show investors and job seekers whether women are being paid equally as they are promoted, she said. “Compensation has been in a black box for decades,” she said. \nRepresentatives of Citigroup and Bank of America declined to discuss Arjuna’s further request. \nA Wells Fargo spokeswoman declined to comment on Arjuna’s current effort but noted language in its proxy filing last year when it opposed a similar resolution from Arjuna as being unnecessary because among other things the bank reviews pay equity annually. \n“We are committed to ensuring that we do not discriminate on the basis of gender in our compensation programs,” the filing states.
