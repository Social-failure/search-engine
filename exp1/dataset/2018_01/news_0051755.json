The special unit has already started cooperation with its counterparts in the United States and Norway. \n“We gain an experienced partner, effective in fighting cybercrime. This is extremely important at a time when cybercriminals and cyber-terrorists develop cooperation among themselves and create more and more advanced tools of attacks,” PSE Chief Executive Eryk Klossowski was quoted as saying in a statement. \nPSE had said in the past that its IT systems are being regularly targeted by cybercriminals, but the attempts are successfully repelled.
