They are going to be attracted by images of combat.”\nIn contrast, the five adverts end with the phrase “Find where you belong”.\nLGBT freedom in the army has made global headlines.\nPresident Donald Trump tried to stop transgender people serving in the U.S. military in July, but his directive was overturned by the federal courts, allowing transgender recruits to enlist from Jan. 1.\n($1 = 0.7399 pounds)\nReporting By Varsha Saraogi, Editing by Katy Migiro.; Please credit the Thomson Reuters Foundation, the charitable arm of Thomson Reuters, that covers humanitarian news, women's rights, trafficking, property rights, climate change and resilience.
