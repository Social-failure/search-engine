It is a strangely insensitive thing to say, particularly at this juncture of women standing up for themselves… pic.twitter.com/Ji59acguNL \n— Sheryl Crow (@SherylCrow) January 30, 2018 ugh bout 2 step up on 2 ur face.. women are making AMAZING music right now wtf is this dude talking about https://t.co/EkijTA33QW \n— CHARLI XCX (@charli_xcx) January 29, 2018 \nEarly Tuesday, Portnow issued a statement to Variety walking back from his comments, though stopping short of an apology. \nSunday night, I was asked a question about the lack of female artist representation in certain categories of this year’s Grammy Awards ,” he said. “Regrettably, I used two words, ‘step up,’ that, when taken out of context, do not convey my beliefs and the point I was trying to make. \nOur industry must recognize that women who dream of careers in music face barriers that men have never faced. We must actively work to eliminate these barriers and encourage women to live their dreams and express their passion and creativity through music. We must welcome, mentor, and empower them. Our community will be richer for it. \nI regret that I wasn’t as articulate as I should have been in conveying this thought. I remain committed to doing everything I can to make our music community a better, safer, and more representative place for everyone. \nPortnow’s comments were especially upsetting as they followed an uplifting performance by Kesha and stirring speech by Janelle Monáe at Sunday’s awards that were a powerful recognition of the # MeToo and Time’s Up movements.
