On Sunday, FAW Car Co Ltd said it would take a 10 percent stake in Mobike’s recently launched car-sharing unit.\nReporting by Brenda Goh; Editing by Stephen Coates\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-09T06:41:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-09T09:42:28.201+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
