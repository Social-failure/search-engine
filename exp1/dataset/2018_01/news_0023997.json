It also plays a key role in the construction of major infrastructure projects, including a new high-speed rail line linking London to Birmingham. \nSigns of trouble at the company had been brewing for some time. Carillion warned in July that it expected to miss profit targets for the first half of the year after losing money on several big construction contracts. Chief Executive Richard Howson stood down and the board scrapped dividend payments as part of a plan to rein in the company‘s borrowing, which ballooned as its cashflow dwindled.
