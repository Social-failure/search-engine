Co-founder and President James Gross will continue with Percolate in an executive leadership role focused on sales and customer growth.\n“I’m excited to join Percolate as it leads the next wave of marketing technology innovation,” Wootton said. “Consumers today are overwhelmed by information and yet they still expect personal engagement with brands. Percolate enables marketers to manage and improve every step in the marketing process so that brands can create meaningful, evolving experiences with consumers.”\nWootton comes to Percolate with a wide range of experiences scaling marketing and technology platforms around the world. He was most recently CEO at predictive marketing pioneer and industry leader Rocket Fuel, where he re-positioned the company as an AI-driven SaaS platform, and ultimately sold it to Sizmek. Prior to Rocket Fuel, Wootton held senior positions at Microsoft and Salesforce and helped both companies achieve triple-digit revenue growth rates for the products and services he oversaw. He started his career as a naval aviator, and has an MBA from Harvard, a Master of Liberal Arts from St. John’s College and a bachelor’s degree from the U.S. Naval Academy.\nContent -- in all its forms -- is the brand experience today.
