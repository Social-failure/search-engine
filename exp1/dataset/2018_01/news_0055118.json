The total value of the agreement is almost USD 29 million over eight years. Approximately USD 13 million will be booked in the third quarter of Elekta's 2017/18 fiscal year. The first Versa HD deliveries are scheduled for 2018.\nMore than 85,000 people are diagnosed with cancer in the province of Ontario each year; TOH treats 4,600 cases with radiation annually. Radiotherapy is recommended for more than half of all cancer cases. Versa HD is designed to be the most sophisticated, high-versatility treatment system, giving clinicians the flexibility to deliver conventional therapies to treat a wide range of small and large tumors throughout the body, while also enabling treatment of highly complex cancers that require extreme targeting precision.\nDr. Jason Pantarotto, MD, FRCPC, and Head of Radiation Oncology at The Ottawa Hospital, says, \"Elekta's Versa HD linear accelerators will enable us to treat a broad spectrum of tumors throughout the body. The advanced technology will help us increase the use of high dose radiation treatments such as stereotactic body radiotherapy. These treatments reduce the total number of patient visits while improving clinical effectiveness.\"\nPete Gaccione, Elekta's Executive Vice President Region North America, says: \"Elekta is proud to continue its established position as a major supplier of cancer treatment and neurosurgery systems. We share The Ottawa Hospital's vision to provide each patient with the world-class care. This agreement will provide thousands of patients at the hospital the opportunity to receive advanced cancer care.\"\nTo learn more about these solutions, visit www.elekta.com\nFor further information, please contact:\nGert van Santen, Group Vice President Corporate Communications, Elekta AB\nTel: +31-653-561-242,\ne-mail: gert.vansanten@elekta.com\nTime zone: CET: Central European Time\nTobias Bülow, Director Financial Communications, Elekta AB\nTel: +46-722-215-017, e-mail: tobias.bulow@elekta.com\nTime zone: CET: Central European Time\nThis is information that Elekta AB (publ) is obliged to make public pursuant to the EU Market Abuse Regulation.
