The index has risen 11 of the past 14 sessions and has not yet fallen in back-to-back sessions this year. \nThe tax bill, signed into law by President Donald Trump last month, included a reduction in the corporate rate to 21 percent. \nSeveral major companies announced they would give employees one-time bonuses or higher wages as a result. \n\"You're hearing shifts in corporate behavior,\" Park said. \"A tilt towards investment. That money [is] flowing into the economy.\" \nEarlier Tuesday, Bridgewater Associates founder Ray Dalio told CNBC the tax cut could lead to some big gains for the stock market. \nPark agreed with the billionaire hedge fund pioneer's assessment. \n\"We're tracking in line with our view,\" Park said. \"Markets always have pullbacks but we still see further upside through the course of this year.\" \nAlso on \"Squawk on the Street\" Tuesday, Baird Chief Investment Strategist Bruce Bittles said he believes the market is healthy. But he said he's concerned about overly bullish investor sentiment. \n\"When everybody is on the same side of the boat ... you might look for a pullback,\" Bittles said. The pullback, however, would be \"limited\" in time and price, he said.
