Fast forward to the new year, and the initial favorite —Atlanta—is still at the top of the list, but its chances have declined from 2/1 to 3/1 and it now shares the perch with southern rival, Austin, Tex. \nHere is a screenshot of the latest odds, pulled from PaddyPower, an Irish betting site that lets people put their money where their mouth is on everything from sports to world events: \nAs you can see by comparing the above list to the original odds below, there have been a number of other developments in the race to attract Amazon . These include a larger list of contenders to bet on (from 13 to 23), and a slight improvement in the outlook for the cities of Philadelphia and Washington, DC. \nHere are some other developments worth noting: Chicago and Denver, which represents two notable omissions from the first list, and are now there but are marked as relative long shots (16/1 and 20/1) Boston, which is regularly mentioned as one of the favorites, is still hanging tough but has fallen slightly from 6/1 to 7/1 The prospects for Toronto have dimmed significantly, from 7/1 to 16/1. \nOverall, the three leading candidates—Atlanta, Austin and Boston—are not a surprise since they all possess many criteria Amazon is seeking, including a tech savvy workforce and urban amenities. Moreover, their location may prove an advantage since most people think it’s unlikely Amazon will add a second headquarters on the west coast. \nGet Data Sheet , Fortune’s technology newsletter. \nMeanwhile, the chances of Toronto or any other non-American city seem far-fetched since it would give President Trump, who has already been assailing Amazon, an excuse to pummel the company for a lack of patriotism. \nFinally, while there has been little in the way of leaks during the process, the city of Atlanta may take encouragement from reports that Amazon recently engaged a lobbyist there. \nSites like PaddyPower (which does not accept bets from Americans) may seem frivolous to some, but many economists view them as valuable “ prediction markets ,” which provide insight into real world outcomes.
