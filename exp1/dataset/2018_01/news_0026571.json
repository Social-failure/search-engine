All known cases of infection were in rural areas where the mosquito that carries the virus can be found. \nMost of the new cases have been reported in the states of Sao Paulo, where 11 people have died of yellow fever since July last year, and Minas Gerais, where four new deaths were reported this week for a total of 15.

Some private drug store chains said they had sold out their shots. \n“So many people have rushed to get vaccinated that health centres were not prepared, but there is no shortage of vaccines,” said Vivian Campos, a spokeswoman for the Minas Gerais state health secretary.
