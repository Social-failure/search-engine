Look at the car today - it’s 80 pct different,” Guajardo said.\nHe said negotiators needed to listen to what Trump had promised to achieve in NAFTA reform, and try to interpret that in a way that did as little damage as possible, with a scope and time frame that was manageable for business.\n“The president is right in saying that in North America, we have to make a much better effort to integrate value production in the North American countries,” he said.\nAnother complex negotiating issue is dispute settlement, he said.\nAsked what could kill NAFTA, Freeland said there was a clause in the agreement that allowed any member to withdraw, after giving six months’ notice, and so a political decision could allow any of the three to leave.\n“It will not kill NAFTA,” Guajardo said.\n“That is what I was about to say,” Freeland added. She urged business leaders at Davos to make their voices heard if they wanted a NAFTA deal.\nThe Davos panel where Guajardo and Freeland were speaking did not include a U.S. government representative.\nWriting by Tom Miles; Editing by Mark Heinrich\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-01-25T21:01:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-25T23:21:17.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
