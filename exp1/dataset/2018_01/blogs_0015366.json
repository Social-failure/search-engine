We're going to overshoot full employment,\" Kaplan said CNBC's \"Squawk Box\" in a live interview.\n\"The history of overshooting full employment in this country has not been a happy one,\" he added. \"Normally, what happens is you get an overheating, the Fed has to play catch up, and what happens then is you tend to often have a recession.\"\nKaplan is a nonvoting member on the Fed's policy-setting Federal Open Market Committee.\nHe said he has increased his estimate for economic growth this year and now sees GDP growing at up to 2.75 percent, a forecast that mirrors one that New York Fed President William Dudley made Thursday.\nHowever, he sees the Fed playing a central role in making sure growth doesn't get out of hand.\n\"In my view, the best way to prolong this expansion is for us to move now in a gradual way, but to continue to remove accommodation, and I think that gives us the best chance to extend this expansion,\" he said.\nGet the market reaction here.\nThis is breaking news.
