We’ll take that encouragement where we can.” \nWork is moving ahead on less-contentious parts of NAFTA, a Canadian source close to the talks said on Saturday, and the three nations have closed a chapter on measures to fight corruption. \nCanada and Mexico initially dismissed some of the main U.S. demands as unworkable but later made it clear they were ready to be more flexible. \nDuring the sixth round, Canada raised what it called creative ways of meeting U.S. demands for higher North American content in autos and a sunset clause that would allow one party to quit the treaty after five years. \n“I think we have demonstrated we have engaged on most of the big issues,” Verheul said in his remarks to Reuters. “We’ve made progress on some of the smaller ones, so I think (it was) not a bad week.” \nSpeaking separately, a second Canadian government source said Ottawa was cautiously optimistic about the round, given that the U.S. side had not summarily rejected the proposals for compromise. \nBut the source, who requested anonymity because of the sensitivity of the situation, said much would depend on Lighthizer’s reaction on Monday. \nMarkets and industries are worried about the possible collapse of the $1.2 trillion pact. \n“It’s unclear to us that anything that anyone does here will be enough ... which is concerning for agriculture,” said Brian Innes, president of the Canadian Agri-food Trade Alliance. \nThe talks were initially scheduled to wrap up by the end of March to avoid clashing with Mexico’s presidential election in July. Guajardo told Reuters on Friday that the process could be extended if need be. \nAndres Manuel Lopez Obrador, the leftist front-runner in the presidential race, said on Friday that the renegotiation should wait until after the election so that the next government, which he aims to lead, would get a say in the treaty’s future.
