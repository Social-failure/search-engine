(NYSE: FII), one of the nation's largest investment managers, today reported earnings per diluted share (EPS) of $1.31 and net income of $131.8 million for Q4 2017. Full-year 2017 EPS was $2.87 and net income was $291.3 million. Federated's Q4 2017 and full-year 2017 results included $70.4 million of net income, representing $0.70 and $0.69 per share for Q4 2017 and full-year 2017, respectively, resulting from the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (Tax Act).\nManagement believes adjusted EPS and adjusted net income, which are non-GAAP financial measures, are useful measures for investors to evaluate Federated's financial performance. The adjusted measures reflect what earnings would have been had the tax law changes not reduced the federal corporate income tax rate from 35 percent to 21 percent, resulting in a revaluation of Federated's net deferred tax liability. As such, Federated's Q4 2017 adjusted EPS was $0.61, up 17 percent from EPS of $0.52 for Q4 2016, and adjusted net income was $61.4 million, compared to net income of $55.8 million for Q4 2016. Full-year 2017 adjusted EPS was $2.18, up 7 percent from EPS of $2.03 for 2016, and adjusted net income was $220.9 million, compared to net income of $208.9 million for 2016 1 .\nFederated's total managed assets were $397.6 billion at Dec. 31, 2017, up $31.7 billion or 9 percent from $365.9 billion at Dec. 31, 2016 and up $33.9 billion or 9 percent from $363.7 billion at Sept. 30, 2017. Average managed assets for Q4 2017 were $382.0 billion, up $23.7 billion or 7 percent from $358.3 billion reported for Q4 2016 and up $21.5 billion or 6 percent from $360.5 billion reported for Q3 2017.\n\"In the fourth quarter, investors showed interest in our MDT and Kaufmann small-cap equity strategies,\" said J. Christopher Donahue, president and chief executive officer. \"Also, continued investor demand for a range of quality fixed-income products helped fourth-quarter flows into high-yield and multisector bond funds.\"\nFederated's board of directors declared a quarterly dividend of $0.25 per share. The dividend is payable on Feb. 15, 2018 to shareholders of record as of Feb. 8, 2018. During Q4 2017, Federated purchased 197,237 shares of Federated class B common stock for $4.6 million, bringing the total shares of Class B common stock purchased in 2017 to 1,841,800 shares for $47.0 million.\nFederated's equity assets were a record $68.1 billion at Dec. 31, 2017, up $5.7 billion or 9 percent from $62.4 billion at Dec. 31, 2016 and up $1.0 billion or 1 percent from $67.1 billion at Sept. 30, 2017. Top-selling equity funds on a net basis during Q4 2017 were Federated MDT Small Cap Core Fund, Federated MDT Small Cap Growth Fund, Federated Kaufmann Small Cap Fund, Federated International Leaders Fund and Federated Muni and Stock Advantage Fund.\nFederated's fixed-income assets were a record $64.2 billion at Dec. 31, 2017, up $12.9 billion or 25 percent from $51.3 billion at Dec. 31, 2016 and up $11.4 billion or 22 percent from $52.8 billion at Sept. 30, 2017. Federated added $11.2 billion in fixed-income separate account assets in Q4 2017, which included a new advisory mandate from a large public institution. Top-selling fixed-income funds on a net basis during Q4 2017 included Federated Institutional High Yield Bond Fund, Federated Total Return Bond Fund, Federated Ultrashort Bond Fund, Federated Short-Intermediate Total Return Bond Fund and Federated Bond Fund.\nFederated's money market assets were $265.2 billion at Dec. 31, 2017, up $13.0 billion or 5 percent from $252.2 billion at Dec. 31, 2016 and up $21.4 billion or 9 percent from $243.8 billion at Sept. 30, 2017. Money market mutual fund assets were $185.5 billion at Dec. 31, 2017, down $20.9 billion or 10 percent from $206.4 billion at Dec. 31, 2016 and up $7.6 billion or 4 percent from $177.9 billion at Sept. 30, 2017. Since Dec. 31, 2016, approximately $21 billion in money market assets have transitioned from Federated funds to Federated separate accounts. Federated's money market separate account assets were $79.7 billion at Dec. 31, 2017, up $33.9 billion or 74 percent from $45.8 billion at Dec. 31, 2016 and up $13.7 billion or 21 percent from $66.0 billion at Sept. 30, 2017.\nFinancial Summary\nQ4 2017 vs. Q4 2016\nRevenue decreased by $11.6 million or 4 percent primarily due to a change in a customer relationship and a change in the mix of average money market assets. The decrease in revenue was partially offset by a decrease in voluntary fee waivers related to certain money market funds in order for those funds to maintain positive or zero net yields (voluntary yield-related fee waivers) and an increase in revenue from higher average equity and fixed-income assets.\nDuring Q4 2017, Federated derived 60 percent of its revenue from equity and fixed-income assets (43 percent from equity assets and 17 percent from fixed-income assets) and 40 percent from money market assets.\nOperating expenses decreased by $17.6 million or 9 percent primarily due to a decrease in distribution expenses related to a change in a customer relationship and lower average money market fund assets, partially offset by an increase in distribution expenses related to a decrease in voluntary yield-related fee waivers.\nQ4 2017 vs. Q3 2017\nRevenue was flat, while operating expenses decreased by $2.1 million or 1 percent primarily due to a decrease in distribution expenses related to a change in the mix of average money market fund assets partially offset by increased professional service fee expenses.\n2017 vs. 2016\nRevenue decreased by $40.4 million or 4 percent primarily due to a change in the mix of average money market assets and a decrease in revenue resulting from a change in a customer relationship. The decrease in revenue was partially offset by a decrease in voluntary yield-related fee waivers and an increase in revenue from higher average equity and fixed-income assets.\nDuring 2017, Federated derived 59 percent of its revenue from equity and fixed-income assets (42 percent from equity assets and 17 percent from fixed-income assets) and 41 percent from money market assets.\nOperating expenses decreased by $46.3 million or 6 percent primarily due to a decrease in distribution expenses related to lower average money market fund assets and a change in a customer relationship, partially offset by an increase in distribution expenses related to a decrease in voluntary yield-related fee waivers. The decrease in operating expenses is also attributable to a decrease in compensation and related expenses resulting from lower incentive compensation.\nNonoperating income, net increased by $5.2 million primarily due to an increase in net investment income principally resulting from related gains recorded on available-for-sale securities.\nFederated's level of business activity and financial results are dependent upon many factors including market conditions, investment performance and investor behavior. These factors and others, including asset levels and mix, product sales and redemptions, market appreciation or depreciation, revenues, fee waivers, expenses and regulatory changes, can significantly impact Federated's business activity levels and financial results. Risk factors and uncertainties that can influence Federated's financial results are discussed in the company's annual and quarterly reports as filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).\nFederated will host an earnings conference call at 9 a.m. Eastern on Jan. 26, 2018.
