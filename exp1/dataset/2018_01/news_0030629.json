He also pointed out that December has one more day than November, which means 3 percent, or 87,000 tonnes, more metal production.\nThe data will likely stir the debate about the government’s years-long push to get rid of excess capacity, and could raise tensions with rival producers, like the United States and Europe, which accuse China of exporting its unwanted metal onto the international market.\nAZ China’s own estimate for China’s December production is 2.975 million tonnes, 10 percent higher than the official NBS number, and 36 million tonnes for the year. Many analysts consider the NBS data to be conservative.\nCLSA’s Victor You estimates another 3.6 million tonnes of new aluminum smelting capacity could come on stream in China in 2018, equivalent to over 11 percent of last year’s production.\nChina’s overall non-ferrous metals output -- including copper, aluminum, lead, zinc and nickel -- rose to 4.72 million tonnes in December, up 9.3 percent from 4.32 million tonnes in November, to the highest level since June and up 2.8 percent from a year earlier.\nFull-year nonferrous production stood at 53.78 million tonnes, up 3 percent from 2016, to set a new annual record.\nReporting by Tom Daly; Editing by Richard Pullin and Christian Schmollinger\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-01-18T18:14:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-18T12:22:56.042+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
