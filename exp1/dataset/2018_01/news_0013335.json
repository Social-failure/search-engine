The numbers are way off the pace in terms of where consensus was and the indications from other banks,” said Piers Brown, European banks analyst at Macquarie.\n“It’s a difficult basis on which to have any confidence they’ve turned around the market share problem they’ve had for the last year and a half.”\nDeutsche blamed last quarter’s fall on “low volatility in financial markets and low levels of client activity”. It gave few other details on where trading has stumbled.\nSeveral US banks, including JP Morgan, Citigroup and Bank of America Merrill Lynch, have previously warned that low volatility and subdued trading would mean revenues fall about 15% from a year ago.\nBut the decline for US banks was exacerbated by a tough comparative period in the fourth quarter of 2016 when they enjoyed strong trading revenues, before and after the election of Donald Trump as US president.\nDeutsche has no such excuse. It brought in €1.2bn in debt and equity sales and trading revenues in the fourth quarter of 2016, easily its worst quarter since the bank restructured at the start of 2016.\nIt would cap a grim 2017 for Deutsche, when it underperformed investment bank rivals every quarter.\nFor the first nine months its debt trading revenues were down 11% from a year earlier (compared with a 6% decline on average across the big five US banks), its equities revenues slumped 18% (up 1% at US rivals), and its advisory and underwriting income was down 2% (up 18% at US banks).\nPressure is expected to build again on Cryan, who was appointed in 2015 to steer the bank’s return to profit, but who is facing renewed questions over his strategy. He has made several attempts to restructure the corporate and investment bank, and last March put former chief financial officer Marcus Schenck in charge, alongside Garth Ritchie, head of global markets.\nCOST CONCERN Analysts said of potentially greater concern was Deutsche Bank’s guidance on Friday about elevated costs for Q4, which are now expected to be broadly in line with a year earlier.\nThat would see adjusted costs of about €6.2bn - or €420m higher than the €5.8bn analysts had expected.\nThat would halt progress Cryan had been showing in reducing costs. In the first nine months of 2017 adjusted costs were €17.5bn, down 6% from the same stage of 2016.\n“The key bull point you could take from the results so far for 2017 was the cost performance, because it’s generally been good,” Brown said. “But this will raise fears that a lot of that has just been because they accrued very low bonuses for nine months, and now they are having a major top-up in the fourth quarter.”\nAnalysts said the investment bank was caught between trying to maintain market share while cutting pay. Cryan slashed bonuses last year, but he told a German newspaper last month he would resume the payment of normal bonuses for 2017.\nMacquarie’s Brown said US banks were taking market share and could be squeezing their cash-strapped European rivals in what they were offering in staff pay.\n“The competitive landscape has been difficult and it doesn’t look like it’s getting any easier,” he said.\nDeutsche’s gloomy trading and costs updates on Friday were also accompanied by other bad news: it will take a €1.5bn one-off hit from the impact of US tax changes in the fourth quarter, which will drag it to its third straight annual loss in 2017.\nThe bank’s shares fell 5% on Friday and lost another 1.3% on Monday.
