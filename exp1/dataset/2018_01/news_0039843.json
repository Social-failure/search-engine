Before the agency could demand a recall from Tesla, it must first open a formal investigation, a step it has not yet taken. \nThe NTSB probe is the safety board’s second into a Tesla crash that may be linked to Autopilot, the automaker’s semi-autonomous driver assist system that handles some tasks and allows drivers under certain conditions to take their hands off the wheel for extended periods. \nTesla requires users to agree to keep their hands on the wheel “at all times” before they can use Autopilot. \nThe Culver City, California fire department said in a Twitter post that on Monday that an engine was struck by a Tesla “traveling at 65 mph. The driver reports the vehicle was on Autopilot. Amazingly there were no injuries.” Reporting by David Shepardson; Editing by Richard Chang", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-24T21:15:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-24T22:02:52.067+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
