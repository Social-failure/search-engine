Significant snowfall, plunging temperatures, and winds over the next week could exacerbate that figure significantly. \nThe National Weather Service is warning Americans to get ready for the impending winter storms which are expected across the eastern seaboard in the coming days. Temperatures in New York City, New England, and many other locales may fall into the low single digits or even the negatives. \nSubscribe to Brainstorm Health Daily , our newsletter about health innovations.

These strong winter systems are notorious for packing big winds and waves to go along with heavy snow! https://t.co/VyWINDk3xP pic.twitter.com/WqpNXoNDmp \n— NWS (@NWS) January 3, 2018 \nA combination of bitter cold and the after effects of winter storms—including downed power lines, insufficient heating supply, and other weather-related problems—could be particularly dangerous for vulnerable populations like the poor, the elderly, the sick, and the homeless. \nWinter time is generally deadly in any given year. In fact, there are nearly 7,000 deaths per day on average in January , and between approximately 6,500 and 6,750 deaths per day in December and February, making them the deadliest months of the year. Per-day deaths fall close to a 5,200 average in the summer and early fall. \nYou can follow the National Weather Service to stay up to date on the “bomb cyclone” and winter storms in the coming days and to receive safety information.
