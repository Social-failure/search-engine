S&P Global has put the U.S. on a slightly lower grade of AA+ since 2011.\nIn December, the U.S. government reported a $23 billion deficit, compared with a gap of $27 billion from the year-earlier month. That took the deficit for the fiscal year to date to $225 billion, versus a gap of $210 billion a year earlier.\nThe government will have to raise the debt ceiling frequently, Dagong said.\n“The virtual solvency of the federal government would be likely to become the detonator of the next financial crisis,” the Chinese ratings firm said.\nLast week, Bloomberg News reported that Chinese officials reviewing the country’s vast foreign exchange holdings had recommended slowing or halting purchases of U.S. Treasury bonds, partly because that market is becoming less attractive for them.\nThat spooked investors worried that sharp swings in China’s massive holdings of U.S. Treasuries would trigger a selloff in bond and equity markets globally. The report sent U.S. Treasury yields to 10-month highs and the dollar lower.\nChina’s foreign exchange regulator has since dismissed the report.\n“The market’s reversing recognition of the value of U.S. Treasury bonds and U.S. dollar will be a powerful force in destroying the fragile debt chain of the federal government,” Dagong said.\nReporting by Ryan Woo; Additional reporting by Philip Wen; Editing by Shri Navaratnam and Sam Holmes\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-01-16T15:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-16T10:05:33.008+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
