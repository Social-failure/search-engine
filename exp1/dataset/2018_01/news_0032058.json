Let’s do it,” the newspaper reported.\n“Our economic success depends on good infrastructure and good connections. Should the Channel Tunnel be just a first step?” Johnson said on Twitter.\nJohnson did not mention the idea of a bridge explicitly in public and it was unclear if any detailed discussions had taken place about how such a large project might be built or financed.\nThe Daily Telegraph said that Johnson believes a privately-funded 22-mile Channel Bridge may now be an option and would provide the capacity for increased tourism and trade after Brexit.\n“Technology is moving on all the time and there are much longer bridges elsewhere,” Johnson told his aides, according to the newspaper.\nA spokesman for the Foreign Office declined to comment.
