It reports full figures on March 8.\nHugo Boss shares, up more than a quarter in the past year and narrowing the discount to luxury peers like LVMH ( LVMH.PA ) and Burberry ( BRBY.L ), were up 2 percent at 0828 GMT, making it one of the biggest gainers on the German mid-cap index .MDAXI.\nRBC analyst Piral Dadhania said growth in Asia Pacific was better than expected and the Americas was also strong but Europe was weaker due to a 5 percent fall in the wholesale business.\nThe Hugo Boss logo is seen in Metzingen, Germany, June 16, 2017. REUTERS/Michaela Rehle “2018 should see further improvements as the brand moves towards its BOSS and HUGO label structure and continues to improve its e-commerce offer,” he wrote.\nSales from its own retail business rose 7 percent in the quarter on a same-store basis, and it saw growth of 11 percent in the United States, where it has been making efforts to move the brand more upmarket by stopping selling in discount outlets.\nIt also said online sales, which fell in the first quarter, jumped 42 percent after it improved its website, boosted its ranking on search engines and offered more lower-priced garments.\nSales rose a currency-adjusted 10 percent in the Asia-Pacific region, driven by China, where luxury goods companies including France’s LVMH and Kering ( PRTP.PA ) have benefitted from revived consumer appetite.\nHugo Boss said it expected its 2017 earnings before interest, taxation, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) before special items to come in at about the 493 million euros it reported for 2016, in line with its forecast.\n($1 = 0.8147 euros)\nAdditional reporting by Christoph Steitz; Editing by Louise Heavens and Edmund Blair\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-16T09:46:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-16T10:01:02.026+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
