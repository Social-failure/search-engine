It had agreed with German administrators to buy the holiday airline for 20 million euros and integrate it into its Vueling brand, before the court ruling threw that plan into doubt.\n“The Group remains hopeful that Vueling can continue with its acquisition and safeguard up to 740 former Niki jobs in Austria and Germany.” (Reporting by Alistair Smout; editing by Jason Neely)\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-01-16T18:44:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-17T19:46:06.006+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
