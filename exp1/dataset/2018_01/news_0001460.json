In his first New Year’s address as North Korea’s leader in 2013, Kim frequently sounded short of breath, his voice wavering from time to time. \nKim made his maiden public address in April 15, 2012 at a parade marking the centenary of his grandfather’s birth. This year, there was none of the uneasiness that marked that speech and his subsequent public addresses. \nHis voice, his hair shaved on the side, as well as his light-colored Western-style suit and glasses, were also reminiscent of his grandfather, Kim Il Sung, according to defectors and analysts. Kim Il Sung had a more gregarious and popular image than Kim Jong Un’s reclusive father, Kim Jong Il. \nKim Jong Un has embraced New Year addresses as a chance to outline his policies and rally the North Korean people. Last year, he used his speech to declare that North Korea was in the “final stages” of perfecting an intercontinental ballistic missile. \nKim Gun-hee, a consultant on image making and leadership, said the grey suit may have been designed to deflect some of the negative global attention Kim’s nuclear and missile tests have prompted. \n“When we advise clients who are in tough situations or are surrounded by unfavourable rumours, we tell them to wear either white or grey,” she said. \n“In the study of colour psychology, white imbues innocence while grey tends to take attention away from you. Kim may have felt some pressure from being at the centre of global focus and turned to grey after sticking to dark tones for several years.” Reporting by Christine Kim, additional reporting by Hyonhee Shin,; Editing by Soyoung Kim and Lincoln Feast", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-02T09:14:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-02T09:39:03.023+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
