At least 20 people were killed and 60 wounded.\n“Mitiga’s air space remains closed and it is up to the authorities to decide when it will be reopened,” the airport administration said in a short statement on Wednesday.\nPetro Air, which operates flights to Libyan oil fields, also said all its flights at Mitiga were still suspended.\nA number of planes parked there were damaged during the clashes, including an A319 Airbus belonging to Afriqiyah Airlines, an Airbus A330 operated by Libyan Airlines, two Boeings operated to Buraq Air, and two jets operated by Libya Wings.\nSome aircraft were moved for safety reasons across the capital to Tripoli’s international airport, which has been closed since 2014 due to damage from earlier fighting.\nReporting by Ahmed Elumami; Editing by Aidan Lewis and John Stonestreet\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-01-18T00:26:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-18T16:02:33.007+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
