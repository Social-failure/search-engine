The chief executive told Reuters last year that performance had improved and it was looking for deals. \nNomad also raised its earnings forecast for 2017, saying fourth-quarter revenue was expected to have grown 5 percent instead of the 3 percent previously flagged. \nIt said 2017 adjusted earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) would be about 328 million euros, above its earlier range of 325-327 million. \nNomad expects the Goodfella’s deal to add to earnings immediately, and to contribute about 150 million euros to revenue and 8-9 euro cents to earnings per share within two years after the deal’s closure, expected during the first quarter of 2018. \nThe acquisition will be funded through cash on hand. $1 = 0.8192 euros Reporting by Martinne Geller; Editing by Mark Potter", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-17T15:16:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-17T15:28:39.005+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
