FAIRYTALE CONTINUES \n“The fairytale continues for us, for me, it’s incredible,” Federer, who equalled Novak Djokovic and Roy Emerson’s Australian Open haul, said on court as wife Mirka and Australian great Rod Laver recorded to the moment with their mobile phones. \n”I got off to a flyer but I froze in the tiebreak and lost that second set and lost control of the match. \n“I got a bit lucky tonight I think.” \nAfter enduring a five-year grand slam drought that had many people writing him off, Federer has enjoyed a glorious renaissance over the past 12 months by winning three of the past five majors. \n“Getting number six here and number 20 overall, it’s just a very special moment,” he said. \nCilic, who will rise to a career-high three in the rankings, won four points in the first four games, but despite a shamelessly pro-Federer crowd, he stuck to his guns.

It could have been the best two weeks of my life,” Cilic said. \n“I had the chance at the beginning of the fifth but he played a great match.” \nTemperatures in Melbourne had hovered in the high 30s Celsius all day but the humidity felt less suffocating than during Saturday’s humdinger of a women’s final. \nSo it was a surprise when the match started with the roof shut, a decision tournament organisers defended by issuing a statement saying “wet bulb globe temperature” readings had triggered the “extreme heat policy”. \nWhile Melbourne Park cooked, Federer was as cool as a cucumber in the relatively benign conditions on court.
