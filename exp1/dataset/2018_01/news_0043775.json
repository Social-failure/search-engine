Those have continued and they continue today.”\nHe added: “Clearly we are very alert to what is happening, specifically in the area of Manbij because that is where our ... coalition forces are.”\n“The coalition forces that are in that area, have an inherent right to defend themselves and will do so if necessary,” he said.\nReporting by Tom Perry; Editing by Gareth Jones\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-01-24T21:15:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-25T13:26:27.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
