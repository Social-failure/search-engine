He has been going well and we are excited for him,” Gatland said. \nAs well as North, Wales will be without skipper Sam Warburton, Dan Biggar, Jonathan Davies, Taulupe Faletau, Dan Lydiate, Rhys Webb and Liam Williams for the tussle at the Principality Stadium. \nRhys Patchell takes Biggar’s place at flyhalf in what Gatland said was a tough selection call. \n“Both Rhys (Patchell) and Gareth (Anscombe) have been training really well over the last couple of weeks. It was a tough call between them,” the coach said. \n”Rhys has started most of his games for the Scarlets at 10. We are really happy with his form and the combination with Gareth Davies at nine.” \nRoss Moriarty returns to strengthen the back row, having missed the end-of-year internationals after being injured on the British and Irish Lions tour to New Zealand. \n“We know what a quality player Ross is. It’s great he is back and available and we are looking forward to seeing his explosive ball carrying on Saturday,” Gatland said. \nWales make six changes in all from their previous test in December, when they beat South Africa 24-22 in Cardiff. \nThey are chasing their first Six Nations title since 2013 and have not lost to Scotland in their past eight home clashes. \nTeam: \n  Reporting   David Goodman", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-30T15:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-30T15:50:09.005+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
