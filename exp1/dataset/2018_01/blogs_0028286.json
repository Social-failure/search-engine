Wozniak started Apple with Steve Jobs in 1976 and was instrumental in the developing the company's early computers. \nWozniak drew laughs with some dark humor at the expense of his late co-founder, who died in 2011. Based on the last Apple organizational chart that he was aware of, Wozniak said that he still reported to Jobs. \n\"Since he died, I can't be fired,\" he said. Tom Munnecke | Getty Images Steve Jobs, left, and Steve Wozniak in 1977 \nWozniak also recounted how he'd given enough of his personal pre-IPO Apple stock options to 80 other employees, \"so they could buy a house.\" \nApple went public in 1980, finishing its first day of trading with a market capitalization of $1.78 billion. It's now the world's most valuable company, worth more than $900 billion. \n\"We didn't start a company to make money,\" said Wozniak, who launched an online technology education service late last year called Woz U. \nThe panel preceded an advance screening of \"Silicon Valley, The Untold Story,\" a documentary on the region that will air in March on the Discovery Science Channel. The other speakers were WhatsApp co-founder Jan Koum, venture capitalist and early Apple employee Heidi Roizen, and Kim Polese, a start-up investor and former executive of Sun Microsystems.
