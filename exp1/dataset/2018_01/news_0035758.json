Cardinal Health did not immediately respond to requests for comment. \nNew York City, whose population is about 8.54 million, joined a long list of U.S. states and municipalities to sue drug companies over opioid abuse, which U.S. President Donald Trump has called a national public health emergency. \nOpioids, including prescription painkillers and heroin, played a role in 42,249 U.S. deaths in 2016, up 28 percent from 2015 and 47 percent from 2014, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. \nIn its complaint filed in state court in Manhattan, New York accused manufacturers of having for two decades misled consumers into believing that prescription opioids were safe to treat chronic non-cancer pain, with minimal risk of addiction. \nThe city also said distributors fueled abuse through oversupply, including a failure to identify suspicious orders and report them to authorities, contributing to an illegal secondary market. \nPrescription opioids, such as Purdue’s OxyContin and Endo’s Percocet, are regulated as controlled substances. \nNew York City said roughly 2.5 million to 2.7 million opioid prescriptions were filled there each year from 2014 to 2016. \nThe case is City of New York v Purdue Pharma LP et al, New York State Supreme Court, New York County, No. 450133/2018.
