Do we really want investors to market our data? I‘m thinking about artificial intelligence, a very sensitive sector that we want more investment in,” he added. \nThe French government has typically held stakes in major blue-chip firms and national industries which it considers to be of strategic importance to the country. \nPast governments have often talked tough about blocking mergers deemed as hostile to the interests of key, national industries, although few have ended up being actually vetoed. \nDuring a trip to China earlier this week, Le Maire said he would announce plans next Monday to boost that 2014 decree, which already widened the government’s control over mergers considered to be in France’s national interests. \nThat decree was rolled out by a previous Socialist government as General Electric was seeking to buy the energy assets of French group Alstom. The deal eventually went through with the government’s blessing. \nA finance ministry source declined to say which companies might be affected, but said it would cover sectors and firms “working with these subjects or using these technologies”.
