Morgan Chase are teaming up to reduce health care costs for their own employees.\nAmong the likely big winners: Telemedicine companies like Teladoc and American Well.\nStart-ups that offer virtual care as an alternative to sending an employee to a physical doctor's office, will likely play a big role in lowering costs.
