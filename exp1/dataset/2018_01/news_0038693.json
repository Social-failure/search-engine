(OTCQX:PBAM)\nPrivate Bancorp of America, Inc. (the “Bancorp”), parent company of San Diego Private Bank (the “Bank”), announces the inclusion of an additional unaudited financial table in the numeric disclosures for the fourth quarter and the fiscal year ended December 31, 2017.\nThe additional table details full-year 2017 and 2016 income and expense. In addition, certain share data for prior quarters is amended in the tables. Income for the year ended December 31, 2017 was $3.425 million or $0.71 per fully-diluted share. Without the revaluation of the Bank’s deferred tax asset, income for the year would have been $4.941 million or $1.03 per fully-diluted share. Thomas V. Wornham, President and CEO commented that “We are very pleased with the 2017 results especially since diluted average shares outstanding are 18% higher in 2017 compared to 2016. The increase is due principally to the successful $17MM capital raise completed in April 2017.”\nAbout Private Bancorp of America, Inc.\nPrivate Bancorp of America, Inc.
