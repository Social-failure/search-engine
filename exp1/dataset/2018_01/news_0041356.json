Before that, Espinosa worked at the Inter-American Development Bank and Mexico’s prestigious ITAM university.\nThe central bank has been battling Mexico’s highest inflation in over 16 years. Although inflation slowed in the first half of January, the board is still expected to raise its benchmark lending rate in February.\nSeparately, Congress also approved the appointment of Miguel Messmacher as new deputy finance minister, and Alberto Torres Garcia as the new deputy minister for revenue.\nThe reshuffling follows the move of the former director of state-run oil company Pemex, Jose Gonzalez Anaya, to head the finance ministry after Jose Antonio Meade stepped down late last year to seek the presidential candidacy for the ruling party.\nAlso on Wednesday, new Pemex chief Carlos Trevino named Pemex executive David Ruelas to take over as the company’s chief financial officer, subject to approval by the Pemex board, the company said in a statement.
