It has also added to tensions between the U.S. and Canada, as the Trump administration seeks to renegotiate terms of the North American Free Trade Agreement, or NAFTA.\nA four-member panel of the ITC, which investigates the effect of subsidies or dumping on the U.S. market, will make the determination, which is scheduled for 2:30 p.m. ET. If there is a tie, the decision will side with the petitioner, Boeing.\nBombardier had said the Commerce Department did not consider a common practice of airplane manufacturers: offering discounts to the first customers of new lines of aircraft.\nDelta Air Lines in 2016 agreed to buy at least 75 planes from Bombardier.\nIn a twist, however, last October, European aerospace giant Airbus , Boeing's chief rival, said it would take a majority stake in the C Series program and said the planes could be manufactured in Alabama, where Airbus already makes narrowbody jets.\nDelta CEO Ed Bastian has repeatedly said the airline won't pay the tariffs and called the duties \"absurd.\" \nThe airline has not taken delivery of the C Series jets yet, so it has not been subjected to the tariffs. Delta, the second-largest U.S. airline, said it opted for the Bombardier jets because Boeing offered it no feasible alternative.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-26T18:25:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-26T18:26:03.005+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
