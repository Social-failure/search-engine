We have not had any negotiations about our missile and defense capabilities and will not talk about these issues with others,” Bahram Qasemi was Quote: d as saying by Tasnim news agency on Monday.\nWith U.S. President Donald Trump warning of a last chance for “the worst deal ever negotiated”, Britain, France and Germany have begun talks on a plan to satisfy him by addressing Iran’s ballistic missile tests and its regional influence while preserving the 2015 accord.\n”The French foreign minister is not familiar with Iranian society yet,“ Qasemi said. ”Iran has proved that it would not change course under pressure.\n“We should surely discuss Iran’s influence in the region because it has been a positive one and everyone has benefited from it. Without Iran’s influence, terrorists (would have) captured Damascus and Baghdad,” he said.\nRobin Emmott in Brussels and Bozorgmehr Sharafedin in London; writing by John Irish; editing by Richard Balmforth\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-01-22T19:06:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-22T19:22:46.009+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
