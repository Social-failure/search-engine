British researchers found that the drug “significantly reversed memory loss” in mice, which opens the door to it being used to reduce memory loss in humans in the future. \nThe study involved giving a triple-receptor drug to mice that had Alzheimer’s and age-related brain deterioration. After they were given the drug, the mice were asked to go through a maze that tested their memory. \nMice that were given the drug showed reduced plaque buildup in the brain (a sign of Alzheimer’s) and overall improved memory. The cellular health of the mice that took the drug was also improved, as was inflammation that was previously seen on their brains, reports Genetic Engineering and Biology News . \nResearchers have been exploring the connection between Alzheimer’s and diabetes for years. The study’s findings could help further existing research as well as move toward finding better treatments for those suffering with Alzheimer’s. The number of people with Alzheimer’s is currently expected to double by 2060 .
