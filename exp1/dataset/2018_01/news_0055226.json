The reason for the discrepancy was not immediately clear.\nThe BBC study said the Afghan government controlled 122 districts, or about 30 percent of the country. Still, it noted, that did not mean that they were free from Taliban attacks.\n“Kabul and other major cities, for example, suffered major attacks - launched from adjacent areas, or by sleeper cells - during the research period, as well as before and after,” the report said.\nAsked about the BBC’s study, the Pentagon did not comment directly, but pointed to the latest figures by the NATO-led coalition asserting that about 56 percent of Afghanistan’s territory was under Afghan government control or influence.\nCaptain Thomas Gresback, a spokesman for the coalition in Kabul, said the BBC estimate overstated the militants’ “influence impact”.\n“This is a criminal network, not a government in waiting,” Gresback said in an emailed statement.\n“What really matters is not the number of districts held, but population controlled. RS assesses that around 12 percent of the population is actually under full Taliban control,” he said, referring to the Resolute Support mission.\nThe study by Britain’s public broadcaster Quote: d a spokesman for Afghan President Ashraf Ghani playing down the findings.\nThe BBC study also said Islamic State had a presence in 30 districts, but noted it did not fully control any of them.\nReporting by Phil Stewart, addional reporting by Robert Birsel in KABUL; Editing by G Crosse and Nick Macfie\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-31T03:22:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-31T03:48:34.016+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
