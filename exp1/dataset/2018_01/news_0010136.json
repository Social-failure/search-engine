But market-watchers say the dialogue around Britain’s exit from the bloc has in general turned more positive for Britain.\n“Up to now the remaining EU countries have presented a fairly uniform front of trying to make things as hard as possible for Britain,” said ACLS Global chief strategist Marshall Gittler.\n“If it turns out that they do try to negotiate a ‘win-win’ solution for Britain, it could help the pound a lot,” he said, highlighting a report by Bloomberg that Luxembourg’s prime minister had called for “pragmatism” and wanted “to limit the negative impact for both sides”.\nSome analysts said German Chancellor Angela Merkel’s breakthrough last week in talks to form a grand coalition in government had helped the pound, as Merkel is seen by markets as an ally of Britain’s and someone who would pursue a mutually beneficial trade deal.\nSterling traded as high as $1.3819 GBP=D3 on Monday, up 0.6 percent on the day and marking a climb of almost 4 U.S. cents since Thursday.\nThe pound was 0.1 percent down against a euro that was trading at three-year highs, with the pound changing hands at 88.89 pence per euro EURGBP=D3.\nAfter slumping in 2016, the pound last year had its best performance in a decade as Britain made some progress on negotiating its exit from the European Union and economic data came in better than expected.\nThe latest positioning data shows long sterling bets have become bigger in recent days, with net sterling long bets rising to their biggest since mid-September 2014.\n“We see the case for Cable (sterling/dollar) to continue in a bullish mood, however in a more relaxed manner,” wrote IronFX strategists in a note to clients.\nTuesday will offer a stern test for sterling bulls with consumer price inflation data. Expectations are for a 3 percent rise in prices for December according to Reuters forecasts; any undershoot would kick sterling lower.\nGraphic: sterling and gilt yields bit.ly/2dgAXn1\nGraphic: World FX rates in 2017 tmsnrt.rs/2egbfVh\nGraphic: Trade-weighted sterling since Brexit vote tmsnrt.rs/2hwV9Hv\nReporting by Jemima Kelly and Saikat Chatterjee; Editing by Ralph Boulton\n ", "external_links": ["http://bit.ly/2dgAXn1", "http://tmsnrt.rs/2egbfVh", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "http://tmsnrt.rs/2hwV9Hv"], "published": "2018-01-16T01:49:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-15T22:25:31.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
