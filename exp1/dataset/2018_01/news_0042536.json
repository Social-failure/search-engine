That lagged a 1 billion crown forecast in a Reuters poll of analysts. \n“The heavy plate market in North America deteriorated during the fall, leading to lower realized prices,” SSAB Chief Executive Martin Lindqvist said. \n“Nevertheless, demand picked up towards the end of the year and market prices for heavy plate rose sharply”. \nSSAB said it expected those higher prices to gradually be reflected in earnings, starting in the first quarter. \nWhile SSAB’s results were “somewhat disappointing”, the miss in the Americas should be looked through as the domestic plate market there has sharply recovered of late, Jefferies said in a research note. \nSSAB proposed a dividend of 1 crown per share, its first since 2012, and above the 0.9 crowns forecast by analysts. \nThe company forecast steel shipments in SSAB Europe and SSAB Americas, which together account for around two thirds of group sales, to be somewhat higher in the current quarter versus the fourth quarter. Shipments in its Special Steels unit, its second largest, were seen stable. \nSSAB shares are up 20 percent since the beginning of November, roughly in line with the Thomson Reuters Europe Steel Index. $1 = 7.8909 Swedish crowns Reporting by Johannes Hellstrom; Editing by Biju Dwarakanath and Mark Potter", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-26T09:55:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-26T10:03:03.007+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
