(NYSE:OIS) announced today that it expects to record a one-time, non-cash charge in the fourth quarter of 2017 as a result of the recently enacted Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (“Tax Reform Legislation”).\nOn December 22, 2017, the United States enacted Tax Reform Legislation which resulted in significant changes to U.S. tax and related laws, including certain key federal income tax provisions applicable to multinational companies such as Oil States.\nGiven the tax law changes, the Company expects to record incremental non-cash income tax expense related to the U.S. transition tax on its unremitted foreign earnings and to provide reserves against its foreign tax credits which were recorded as assets prior to U.S. tax reform. Additionally, the Company is required to revalue its other U.S. deferred tax assets and liabilities to reflect the lower U.S. corporate income tax rate which has been reduced from 35% to 21%. The Company has estimated that this one-time, non-cash charge associated with U.S. income tax reform will range between $27 million to $30 million of incremental income tax expense which will be recorded in the fourth quarter of 2017.\nOn a longer term basis, certain aspects of the Tax Reform Legislation are expected to have a positive impact on the Company’s future U.S. income tax expense, including the reduction in the U.S. corporate income tax rate.\nThe ultimate impact of the Tax Reform Legislation may differ from the Company's estimates, possibly materially, due to changes in the interpretations and assumptions made by the Company as well as additional regulatory guidance that may be issued and actions the Company may take as a result of the Tax Reform Legislation. The Company will continue to assess the expected impacts of the new tax law and it will include its estimated impacts and additional disclosures in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017.\nAbout Oil States\nOil States International, Inc. is a global oilfield products and services company serving the drilling, completions, subsea, production and infrastructure sectors of the oil and gas industry.
