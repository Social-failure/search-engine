(“Salisbury”), (NASDAQ:SAL), the holding company for Salisbury Bank and Trust Company (the “Bank”), announced results for its fourth quarter and full year ended December 31, 2017.\nNet income available to common shareholders was $1.1 million, or $0.39 per common share, for Salisbury’s fourth quarter ended December 31, 2017 (fourth quarter 2017), compared with $1.7 million, or $0.61 per common share, for the third quarter ended September 30, 2017 (third quarter 2017), and $1.5 million, or $0.55 per common share, for the fourth quarter ended December 31, 2016 (fourth quarter 2016).\nResults for the fourth quarter and full year 2017 included after-tax losses of $884 thousand or $0.32 per share and $1.1 million or $0.41 per share, respectively related to OREO. Results for the fourth quarter and full year also included a charge of $445 thousand or $0.16 per share related to the remeasurement of net deferred tax assets due to the enactment of the new U.S. tax law during the quarter.\nSalisbury’s President and Chief Executive Officer, Richard J. Cantele, Jr., stated, “In 2017 we made measurable progress on our strategy to improve asset quality and to achieve growth through prudent acquisitions. Although we incurred losses this year on the sale of OREO properties, our non-performing assets declined significantly during the fourth quarter. In June 2017 we completed the acquisition of the New Paltz, New York branch from Empire State Bank and in December 2017, we executed and announced a definitive agreement to acquire the Fishkill, New York branch of Orange Bank & Trust Company. The acquisition, which is subject to regulatory approval, is expected to be completed in the second quarter of this year. We enter 2018 well-positioned for continued growth and we remain focused on managing asset quality and enhancing profitability while maintaining our commitment to provide outstanding customer service.”\nNet Interest Income\nTax equivalent net interest income for the fourth quarter 2017 increased $248 thousand, or 3.1%, versus third quarter 2017, and increased $265 thousand, or 3.3%, versus fourth quarter 2016. Net interest income for the current quarter included $183 thousand for interest received upon settlement of a past due loan. Average earning assets increased $1.9 million versus third quarter 2017, and increased $49.3 million versus fourth quarter 2016. Average total interest bearing deposits decreased $0.2 million versus third quarter 2017 and increased $27.5 million versus fourth quarter 2016. The increase in average interest bearing deposits from the prior year fourth quarter reflected the acquisition of the New Paltz branch, which increased deposits by approximately $31 million. The tax equivalent net interest margin for the fourth quarter was 3.58% compared with 3.50% for the third quarter 2017 and 3.45% for the fourth quarter 2016.\nNon-Interest Income\nNon-interest income for fourth quarter 2017 increased $102 thousand versus third quarter 2017 and decreased $144 thousand versus fourth quarter 2016. Trust and Wealth Advisory revenues decreased $17 thousand versus third quarter 2017 and increased $36 thousand versus fourth quarter 2016. The quarter-over-quarter net revenue decrease primarily resulted from lower fees for life insurance trust administration, whereas the increase from the prior year fourth quarter primarily reflected net growth in asset based fees.\nService charges and fees decreased $17 thousand versus third quarter 2017, and increased $63 thousand versus fourth quarter 2016. The decline from the third quarter primarily reflected lower ATM, safe deposit rental, and other fees whereas the increase from the prior year fourth quarter primarily reflected higher ATM and interchange fees.\n1 Significant items include losses on the sale of OREO properties and a charge related to the remeasurement of net deferred tax assets following the enactment of the new U.S. tax law during the current quarter. The impact of these items on net income available to common shareholders and earnings per share is presented in the text of this release.\nIncome from mortgage sales and servicing decreased $33 thousand versus third quarter 2017 and decreased $18 thousand versus fourth quarter 2016. The decline from the third quarter was primarily attributed to a reversal of impairment charges for mortgage servicing rights in the prior quarter. The decrease from the fourth quarter of 2016 primarily reflected lower gains on mortgage sales, due to a reduction in volume, partly offset by lower amortization charges for mortgage servicing rights.\nGains on the sale of available-for-sale securities for the fourth quarter were $193 thousand compared with $427 thousand in the fourth quarter of 2016.\nNon-Interest Expense\nNon-interest expense included OREO charges of $1.4 million for the fourth quarter compared with charges of $218 thousand in the prior quarter and $435 thousand in the prior year fourth quarter. Excluding these charges, non-interest expense for fourth quarter 2017 declined $305 thousand versus third quarter 2017 and declined $278 thousand versus fourth quarter 2016. Salaries and benefits decreased $120 thousand versus third quarter 2017, and decreased $163 thousand versus fourth quarter 2016. The decrease for both periods primarily reflected lower benefits and lower deferred compensation expense.\nPremises and equipment costs increased $39 thousand versus third quarter 2017 and increased $205 thousand versus fourth quarter 2016. The increase from the prior year fourth quarter reflected higher lease expense, which included costs related to the acquisition of the New Paltz branch, and higher depreciation and maintenance expense for computer equipment and software. Data processing expenses, which also include data communications related expenses, decreased $9 thousand versus third quarter 2017 and decreased $201 thousand versus fourth quarter 2016. The prior year fourth quarter included expenses related to the Bank’s core system conversion and the upgrade of data communication capabilities to support new technologies.\nProfessional fees increased $56 thousand versus third quarter 2017 and increased $7 thousand versus fourth quarter 2016. The quarter over quarter increase was mainly attributed to higher audit and investment management fees offset by a reduction in legal and consulting expense. The increase from the prior year fourth quarter reflected higher legal, consulting and audit fees which were mostly offset by lower internal audit and investment management fees.\nOREO and loan related expenses of $1.4 million, included the OREO charge noted above. Excluding OREO expenses in the fourth quarter and comparative quarters, OREO and loan related expenses decreased $253 thousand versus the third quarter 2017 and decreased $196 thousand compared with the fourth quarter 2016. The declines primarily reflected a reversal of accruals for OREO carrying costs and the delinquent real estate taxes on OREO properties.\nThe effective income tax rates for fourth quarter 2017, third quarter 2017 and fourth quarter 2016 were 48.42%, 29.09% and 27.62%, respectively. Excluding the discrete charge in the fourth quarter 2017 related to the change in U.S. tax law, the effective tax rate for the quarter was 27.12%.\nLoans\nNet loans receivable increased $18 million, or 2% from $784 million as of the third quarter 2017 to $802 million at December 31, 2017, and increased $39 million, or 5% from $763 million at December 31, 2016.\nAsset Quality\nNon-performing assets decreased $4.9 million during the current quarter to $7.4 million, or 0.74% of assets at December 31, 2017, from $12.3 million, or 1.3% of assets at September 30, 2017, and decreased $5.2 million from $12.6 million, or 1.3% of assets, at December 31, 2016. The decrease in non-performing assets from the third quarter of 2017 and the prior year fourth quarter reflected the sale of OREO and a decline in non-performing loans.\nThe amount of total impaired and potential problem loans were $23.9 million or 2.97% of gross loans receivable at December 31, 2017 compared to $23.3 million, or 2.95% of gross loans receivable at September 30, 2017 and $23.6 million, or 3.07% of gross loans receivable at December 31, 2016.\nAccruing loans receivable 30-to-89 days past due increased $0.1 million during fourth quarter 2017 to $3.5 million, or 0.44% of gross loans receivable, from $3.4 million, or 0.44% of gross loans receivable at September 30, 2017, and decreased $1.0 million from $4.5 million, or 0.59% of gross loans receivable at December 31, 2016.\nSalisbury endeavors to work constructively to resolve its non-performing loan issues with customers. Substantially all non-performing loans are collateralized with real estate and the repayment of such loans is largely dependent on the return of such loans to performing status or the liquidation of the underlying real estate collateral.\nThe provision for loan loss expense was $67 thousand for fourth quarter 2017 versus a charge of $237 thousand for third quarter 2017, and a charge of $503 thousand for the fourth quarter 2016. The decline in the provision was primarily attributable to recoveries of $334 thousand received in the fourth quarter. Net loan charge-offs (recoveries) were ($300) thousand for the fourth quarter 2017, $236 thousand for third quarter 2017 and $263 thousand for the fourth quarter 2016. Reserve coverage, as measured by the ratio of the allowance for loan losses to gross loans, was 0.84% for the fourth quarter 2017, versus 0.82% for the third quarter 2017 and 0.79% for the fourth quarter 2016. Similarly, reserve coverage, as measured by the ratio of the allowance for loan losses to non-performing loans was 102% for the fourth quarter of 2017, versus 79% for the third quarter of 2017 and 69% for the fourth quarter of 2016.\nCapital\nShareholders’ equity was $97.5 million at December 31, 2017 and book value and tangible book value were $35.01 and $29.39, respectively. Tangible book value excludes goodwill and core deposit intangibles.\nThe regulatory capital ratios of the Company and the Bank remain in compliance with regulatory “well capitalized” requirements. At December 31, 2017, Salisbury’s tier 1 leverage, total risk-based capital, and common equity tier 1 capital ratios were 8.53%, 12.94%, and 10.73%, respectively. The Bank’s tier 1 leverage, total risk-based capital, and common equity tier 1 capital ratios were 9.25%, 12.54%, and 11.64%, respectively, compared with regulatory “well capitalized” minimums of 5.00%, 10.00%, and 6.5%, respectively.\nDividends on Common Shares\nConsistent with the dividends declared in each calendar quarter of 2017, the Board of Directors of Salisbury declared a $0.28 per common share quarterly cash dividend at their January 26, 2018 meeting. Such dividend will be paid on February 23, 2018 to shareholders of record as of February 9, 2018.\nBackground\nSalisbury Bancorp, Inc. is the parent company of Salisbury Bank and Trust Company (the “Bank”), a Connecticut chartered commercial bank serving the communities of northwestern Connecticut and proximate communities in New York and Massachusetts, since 1848, through full service branches in Canaan, Lakeville, Salisbury and Sharon, Connecticut; Great Barrington, South Egremont and Sheffield, Massachusetts; and Dover Plains, Fishkill, Millerton, Newburgh, New Paltz, Poughkeepsie, and Red Oaks Mill, New York.
