REUTERS/Fabian Bimmer \nHe said the New York Times report showed VW had to raise its game in improving ethical standards, and pledged to take the necessary action once it had finished investigating EUGT’s work. \n“We must live and deal with setbacks,” he said. \nVW said on Monday the EUGT study was never discussed in any management board meetings, after the Bild newspaper earlier reported an internal e-mail showed at least some senior managers were informed about the design of the research. \nThe study risks dealing another blow to diesel technology, in which the German auto industry has invested heavily. \nMueller and CEOs from German manufacturers and suppliers including Daimler and Continental ( CONG.DE ) will on Tuesday discuss ways of trying to regain the initiative after the fume test revelations, two auto industry sources told Reuters. \nExecutives are expected to meet in Berlin on Tuesday to elect the new head of Germany’s VDA car industry lobby. \nGerman autos supplier Robert Bosch said on Tuesday the revelations were damaging for the entire industry and that a decline in demand for diesel could pose a threat to jobs. \n“Bosch had nothing to do with the animal experiments. I am as appalled as you all are,” CEO Volkmar Denner said. \nSeparately, the VDA said on Tuesday carmakers were in talks with cities including Berlin and Hamburg about ways to speed up and expand steps to tackle pollution from diesel vehicles in a bid to avoid possible bans. \nGerman Environment Minister Barbara Hendricks is meeting with European peers in Brussels to discuss government measures designed to improve air quality in badly polluted cities.
