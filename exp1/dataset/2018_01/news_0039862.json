REUTERS/Leah Millis “We’re going to solve the problem. It’s up to the Democrats, but they (the Dreamers) should not be concerned,” Trump said.\nTrump, whose hardline immigration stance was a key part of his 2016 presidential campaign, announced in September he was ending the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) programme created by Democratic predecessor Barack Obama unless Congress came up with a new law.\nDespite Trump’s remarks, Democrats remained cautious ahead of the unveiling of the White House framework.\n“The White House unfortunately has proven unreliable and wildly unpredictable,” Democratic Senate leader Chuck Schumer said on the Senate floor. “Within the course of hours they say different things. Every time the president moves forward on one thing, his staff pulls him back and undoes what he says.”\nSchumer urged the bipartisan group of senators to keep meeting and reach a “narrow” deal on the Dreamers and border security.\n“As we found time and again, when we open up the negotiations to discussions of broad immigration reform, there is no end to what each party says could be on the table,” Schumer said.\nJohn Cornyn, the No. 2 Senate Republican and a key negotiator, said Trump’s comments “surprised a lot of people” but displayed the president’s eagerness for a permanent solution.\n“What he didn’t talk about and what I want to hear from him on is the rest of the requirement, on border security, on diversity lottery and on chain migration,” Cornyn told reporters.\n“If we’re going to have a permanent solution on DACA recipients then we need a permanent solution on border security. Which means not only a plan but the funds front-loaded to pay for it.”\nEditing by Cynthia Osterman\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-25T20:50:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-25T21:27:17.005+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
