Most members of the group covered by the 2010 deal with ICE entered the county legally but overstayed their visas and failed to seek asylum on time.\nFederal officials contend they have always had the authority to deport them at any time.\n“There’s no legal basis for them to ask for more time,” Vinita Andrapalliyal, a U.S. Justice Department lawyer, argued in court on Wednesday.\nFederal law gives authority over immigration matters to the executive branch, not the courts.\nOver the Justice Department’s objections, Saris last year ruled she had jurisdiction over the case. She entered a temporary order blocking the Indonesians’ deportation until she could decide whether to impose a preliminary injunction.\nRonaldo Rauseo-Ricupero, a lawyer for the Indonesians, argued they should have 90 days to move to reopen their cases after receiving copies of their administrative case files and time to appeal any decision rejecting those motions.\nSaris in October ordered immigration officials to provide the immigrants’ lawyers with the files so they could start their administrative appeals. The files are expected to be finished being turned over by next month, Saris said.\nReporting by Nate Raymond and Scott Malone in Boston; Editing by Andrew Hay\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-17T20:37:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-17T20:50:18.034+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
