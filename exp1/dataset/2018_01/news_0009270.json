REUTERS/Ognen Teofilovski \nSpain also enjoyed plain sailing, having stifled out the Czechs with tight defence which opened up plenty of fast breaks at the other end of the court. \nThe Spaniards never took their feet off the pedal and their deep roster produced an array of scorers, as Valero Rivera, Raul Entrerrios and Ferran Sole led the way with five goals each. Slideshow (4 Images) \nDenmark forced Hungary into submission in the last third of the game, despite having pack leader Mikkel Hansen ejected for three two-minute suspensions. \nUp to that point, Hungary had matched the Danes in every department but could no longer keep up with the torrid pace even after Hansen, who scored six goals, was confined to watching the rest of the match from the jam-packed stands in Varazdin. \nBackcourt shooter Rasmus Lauge took over the mantle from Hansen in the closing stages and finished as the game’s top scorer with seven goals.
