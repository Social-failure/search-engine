REUTERS/Ludovic MARIN/Pool \nPresident Emmanuel Macron, who turned 40 last month, fell for Brigitte during rehearsals for a school play at the Providence high school in Amiens, and defied his parents’ disapproval to pursue the relationship with a woman 24 years his senior. \nThe book, “Brigitte Macron, The Liberated Woman”, to be published next week, quotes a family neighbor from Macron’s home town who says she typed up the 300-page manuscript. \n“It was a daring novel, a little bit smutty. Of course, the names were not the same but I think he needed to express what he was feeling at the time,” the unnamed neighbor is quoted as saying in excerpts published by Closer magazine. \nA spokeswoman for Macron’s office declined to comment.

The finance minister, Bruno Le Maire, has written a novel entitled ‘Le Ministre’ (The Minister), which includes a steamy scene between the minister and his wife in Venice. \nMacron’s literary ambitions as a young man are well known and he wrote at least two unpublished works before authoring a book entitled “Revolution” during his election campaign. \nHe told the weekly magazine Le Point last year that he had not sought a publisher for the earlier works “as I was not happy with them”. \nIn a separate article for the same magazine, asked by French author Philippe Besson if he regretted not becoming a writer himself, Macron replied: “My life isn’t finished yet.” Additional reporting by Jean-Baptiste Vey; Editing by Kevin Liffey", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-13T17:35:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-13T18:04:39.002+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
