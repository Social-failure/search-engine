Fitch acquired its original shareholding in Lianhe in April 2007.\nMoody’s Investors Service operates in China as a 49 percent shareholder in China Chengxin International Credit Rating Co, while S&P Global Ratings has a partnership with Shanghai Brilliance Credit Rating & Investors Service Co.\nGIC and Lianhe Ratings said in a joint statement that the investment will facilitate the ratings firm’s long-term development and internationalization.\n“Lianhe Ratings is confident of the rating industry’s long-term potential as China’s economy and bond market, as well as its share of the global economy, continue to grow,” the statement said.\nFitch said it would continue to operate its international credit ratings business throughout the region, including through its offices in Beijing and Shanghai.
