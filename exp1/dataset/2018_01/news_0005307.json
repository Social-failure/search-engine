I can assure you that that will not happen ... We are very skeptical of Kim Jong Un’s sincerity in sitting down and having talks.”\nReporting by Arshad Mohammed; Editing by James Dalgleish\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-01-03T04:41:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-03T06:37:36.004+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
