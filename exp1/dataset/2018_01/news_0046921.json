In a statement on Wednesday following the USOC demand, the federation said it supported the letter but did not specifically address the call for board members’ resignations.\nThe webpage listing USAG’s board members appeared to have been taken down around midday on Thursday without explanation.\nThe USOC itself has not escaped criticism from some of the sport’s biggest names.\n“I have represented the USA in two Olympics and have done so successfully,” gold medalist Aly Raisman, who accused Nassar of abusing her, said at his hearing. “And both USA Gymnastics and the U.S. Olympic Committee have been very quick to capitalize and celebrate my success, but did they reach out when I came forward? No.”\nLou Anna Simon, the president of Michigan State University, where Nassar also worked, stepped down late on Wednesday night amid calls from critics and Michigan lawmakers for her termination.\n“As tragedies are politicized, blame is inevitable. As president, it is only natural that I am the focus of this anger,” Simon said in her resignation letter.\nAdditional reporting by Joseph Ax in New York and Steve Friess in Lansing, Michigan; writing by Jon Herskovitz; editing by Gareth Jones and Cynthia Osterman\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-01-25T18:50:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-25T12:52:27.013+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
