We are contacting those exchanges,” Singapore-based McDonald told Reuters. \nHackers made off with roughly 58 billion yen ($532.6 million) from Tokyo-based cryptocurrency exchange Coincheck Inc late last week, raising questions about security and regulatory protection in the emerging market of digital assets. [nL4N1PP06T] \nXEM is the world’s 10th biggest cryptocurrency. As of 1601 GMT, XEM was trading at around $0.83 per coin, according to trade website Coinmarketcap, with a total market value of around $7.5 billion.
