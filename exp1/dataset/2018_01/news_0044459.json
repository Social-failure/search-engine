Other countries are facing similar situations but unlike these countries, many of whom are seeing inflation move around 1.5 percent, inflation excluding energy costs is barely above 0 percent in Japan,\" the news agency cited the BOJ governor as saying.\nshow chapters The BoJ will be the last of the big central banks to change policy 13 Hours Ago | 02:07 The BOJ earlier this month announced it was slightly reducing its purchases of long-dated Japanese government bonds, which led to speculation that the institution would be the latest to follow in the footsteps of global central banks in tightening policy.\nBut with inflation still \"well below\" a 2 percent target, normalization remained a premature suggestion for the BOJ, Kohei Iwahara, an economist at Natixis Japan Securities, wrote in a note ahead of the central bank's Tuesday announcement.\n\"Any hint to normalize could strengthen the yen further, increasing challenges of the BOJ to meet the inflation target,\" Iwahara added.\nJapan's core consumer price index increased 0.9 percent on year in November, the 11th consecutive month a rise was recorded.\nThe metric is forecast to grow by the same level in December, according to a Reuters poll . December data is scheduled to be released on Friday.\nWhen both food and energy prices are excluded, however, consumer prices rose just 0.3 percent in November.\nGiven those figures, \"it's very hard to believe [the] BOJ will send any signal that they will change the policy anytime soon,\" Kazuo Momma, executive economist at Mizuho Research Institute told CNBC's \"The Rundown.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-23T05:16:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-23T05:16:50.003+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
