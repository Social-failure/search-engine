He angrily blasted Democrats on Twitter for the shutdown. \n“Democrats are holding our Military hostage over their desire to have unchecked illegal immigration. Can’t let that happen!” he tweeted. — Billy House, Arit John, Laura Litvan Related Articles", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-20T22:49:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-21T04:26:13.008+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
