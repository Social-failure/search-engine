The presidential candidate will evidently be Puigdemont,” Junts pel Catalunya representative Jordi Xucla told Spanish national radio.\nHowever, if Puigdemont is elected leader it is uncertain how he would govern from Brussels. He is likely to be arrested if he returns to Spain where he faces charges of sedition, rebellion and misuse of public funds.\nInes Arrimadas, the leader of Ciudadanos (Citizens), which favors unity with Spain, said a fugitive from justice could not be a leader in Catalonia.\n“You can’t have a hologram president in Catalonia,” she said in a television interview on Tuesday. “You can’t be president of Catalonia from Brussels by Skype,” she said.\nHer party won the most votes in December but not enough to form a government.\nOnce the Catalan parliament is formed, potential leaders of the regional government will put themselves forward for a vote of confidence, although it could take months for a new government to emerge.\nMany of the Catalan political leaders were arrested on charges of sedition and rebellion after the independence declaration, with three still behind bars pending a trial, while Puigdemont, with four of his cabinet members, fled to Brussels.\nThe other main potential candidate to represent the pro-independence parties would be ERC leader Oriol Junqueras, who is serving a custodial sentence in a Madrid jail.\nJunqueras has asked for release from jail to attend the first meeting of the new Catalan parliament.\nEditing by Alison Williams\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-10T12:49:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-10T13:04:22.099+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
