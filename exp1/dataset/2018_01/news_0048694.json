It chairs EU Council meetings until June 30. \nBut the dispute also highlights widespread resistance among the more socially conservative countries of the former eastern bloc to the liberal values of wealthier western Europe. The easterners, led by Poland and Hungary, have also rallied against the EU’s bid to have them take in more migrants and refugees. PM REJECTS CRITICISM \nSpeaking from the World Economic Forum annual meeting in the Swiss Alpine town of Davos, Borissov said he was convinced the convention would be ratified, and he reiterated that it would not oblige Bulgaria to introduce a “third sex” legal category or to legalise gay marriage. \n“If there is a referendum, it must be clearly defined: If we are ”for“ or ”against“ the women and children of Bulgaria being beaten,” he told reporters. “Because all the other texts they speak of - a third sex, gay marriage - are not in the convention at all.” \nThe government signed the 81-article document in 2016 and parliamentary ratification is the next step. In all, more than 40 countries have signed. \n“There must be transparency and awareness during the vote,” Tsvetanov told reporters. “We are obliged to do what other EU countries, and even non-EU countries, have already done.” \n“We will do our best in these weeks to have a further debate with the academic community, NGOs and experts so we can really explain everything that is related to the objectives of the convention and the opportunities it gives,” he said. \nNils Muiznieks, the Human Rights Commissioner at the Council of Europe, and the deputy head of the EU Commission, Frans Timmermans, have both urged Bulgaria to ratify the treaty quickly.
