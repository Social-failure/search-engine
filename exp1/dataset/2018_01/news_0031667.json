The Dow, after briefly hitting the 26,000 milestone on Tuesday, its fastest 1000-point rise, is on track to close above that mark for the first time.\nMore than three-quarters of the 36 S&P 500 companies that have reported so far have topped earnings estimates, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.\n“The positive earnings revision is the strongest we’ve seen in several years,” said Keith Lerner, chief market strategist at SunTrust Advisory Services in Atlanta. “It’s been hockey-stick growth up since the tax bill passed.”\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 270.7 points, or 1.05 percent, to 26,063.56, the S&P 500 gained 25.71 points, or 0.93 percent, to 2,802.13 and the Nasdaq Composite added 69.75 points, or 0.97 percent, to 7,293.43.\nBoeing jumped 3.5 percent after the company announced a joint venture with car seating leader Adient to make aircraft seats.\nIBM rose 3.0 percent after Barclays analysts double upgraded the stock to “overweight” and hiked its price target by $59 to $192.\nSeveral companies, however, saw their shares trade lower after underwhelming earnings reports and forecasts.\nGoldman Sachs was down 2.2 percent after posting its first quarterly loss in six years on tax-related charges and a sharp drop in trading revenue.\nFord slipped 7.3 percent after the automaker reported full-year profit below estimates and provided a downbeat forecast.\nGeneral Electric slipped 4.5 percent, extending losses from Tuesday, when it announced more than $11 billion in charges.\nAdvancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 1.99-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.81-to-1 ratio favored advancers.\nThe S&P 500 posted 67 new 52-week highs and 6 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 78 new highs and 30 new lows.
