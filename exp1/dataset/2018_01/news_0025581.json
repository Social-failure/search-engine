And it’s almost as if I were to re-encounter myself now as a baby, I would not recognize myself.”\nSlideshow (9 Images) In a manifesto in 1961 when he was 23, he said he was “swollen and bloated” with memories of the Nazi era - his father had been a party member - and the aftermath of a divided Germany and the socialist East, which he fled in 1957.\nHis early paintings in the 1960s, he said, were “aggressive, wholly malicious”, referring to works which at the time German prosecutors seized as lewd.\nIn later years the uneasy portraits of the 1960s and 1970s evolved into sprawling works in dark and pastel tones, and he became famous for his ‘upside down’ paintings - a quirk of presentation he has pursued to the present day.\nBringing together some 90 paintings and 12 sculptures spanning from 1959 through the present day, the exhibit is open to the public from Jan. 21 through April 29.\nEditing by Richard Balmforth\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-19T18:03:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-19T18:25:53.029+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
