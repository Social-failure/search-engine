But it would take strong action to protect its sovereignty.\n“The government will not hesitate, in defending the rights of the people and the sovereignty and dignity of the country, to take appropriately strong action on any foreign party that contravenes such norms and values as enshrined in the convention,” Anifah said in a statement.\nThe EU ambassadors could not be reached immediately for comment while the embassies were closed for the weekend.\nMalaysia's Prime Minister Najib Razak and his wife Rosmah Mansor walk towards their car after arriving at Air Force Station Palam in New Delhi, India January 24, 2018. REUTERS/Adnan Abidi Opposition parties have long accused the United Malays National Organisation (UMNO), which has been in power since Malaysia’s independence in 1957, of election rigging and fraud. The accusations have been consistently denied by the government.\nMahathir, who served as Prime Minister for 22 years, has himself been critical of Western intervention in the past and was reported to have stopped opposition leaders from meeting foreign envoys during his rule.\nAnifah said that last week’s meeting could also affect Malaysia’s efforts to defend the nation’s palm oil industry after the EU’s decision to back a ban on using palm oil to make biofuels.\nMalaysia is reviewing its trade with the European Union after the ban.\n“This (meeting) clearly impacts the government’s efforts to defend the country’s sovereignty and image, including the government’s efforts to defend the nation’s palm oil industry,” Anifah said in the statement.\nMahathir will become the world’ oldest prime minister if he defeats Najib and wins the elections this year. But Najib is still widely expected to win the vote, despite being accused of graft and mismanagement.\nReporting by Praveen Menon; Editing by David Goodman\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-28T17:35:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-28T18:05:40.008+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
