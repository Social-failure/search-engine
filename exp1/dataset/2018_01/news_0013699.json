Some firms have also sought to evade monitoring by operating only at night. \nThe ministry has sought to reduce “administrative interference” in its emissions data by bringing all its 1,436 monitoring stations under central government control and denying local authorities access to the equipment. \nThis isn’t the first time Henan has been castigated for failing to maintain the integrity of its air quality data, with the ministry accusing local firms of providing fraudulent emissions figures in March last year. \nLocal environmental officials in the northwestern city of Xian have also been punished for stuffing sensors with cotton and removing surveillance tapes.
