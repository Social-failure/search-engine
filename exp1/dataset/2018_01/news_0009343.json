Nerayoff, who helped craft token sales for the ethereum project,said businesses in an increasingly wide variety of industries are starting to take note of what value Ethereum's protocol could offer them. \n\"You're seeing a tremendous amount of growth across a wide variety of industries. Fintech is actually the natural area, but now you're seeing it becoming increasingly more creative — you find projects in the oil and gas industry, you're finding government using it in their applications, you're seeing it in gaming, all kinds of different areas,\" Nerayoff said. \nBeyond project building, Nerayoff said usage is increasing because ethereum can process transactions more quickly and cheaply than its rival. \n\"People are actually using it for currency, as well,\" he said. \"Lower transactional costs are increasing usage of the entire network, and that's increasing the network effects of it. There are more users, more projects being built on there and more programmers,\" he said. \nDespite his confidence, Nerayoff isn't discounting bitcoin and the interest in cryptocurrency it inspired in 2017. \n\"The entire space is increasing. There is huge interest by the public and there are more areas in which the public can invest, even in bitcoin, so you could just see an expansion in the entire space,\" he said. \nEither way, when it comes to 2018, Nerayoff thinks ethereum is going to have a good year. \nOn the Luxembourg-based Bitstamp exchange, bitcoin closed down 8.73 percent at $14,766.86, with a market cap of $248 billion. \nEthereum had an estimated $110 billion market cap at close.
