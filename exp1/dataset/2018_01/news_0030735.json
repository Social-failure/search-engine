Fore, UNICEF’s executive director, made the warning after visiting some of the areas most devastated by the war.\n“70 percent of the children are out of school, that is highest in the world. There is too much violence,” she said.\n“If we don’t help... we are going to lose this generation and that would be tragic for South Sudan because a country cannot build itself without this next generation of young people.”\nFore said she had visited towns in the country’s north and witnessed widespread malnutrition among children and warned: “We are heading into the dry season... we might lose up to quarter million children in South Sudan.”\nAn estimated tens of thousands have died in the conflict which has also displaced a quarter of the country’s population of 12 million.\nThe country’s economy, nearly entirely dependant on oil exports, has been left in tatters as output has been cut.\nAgricultural production, too, has declined as insecurity has left some times entire villages abandoned and gardens unattended.\nA ceasefire deal was signed in Ethiopia’s capital Addis Ababa last month to halt the fighting but it has been violated repeatedly with both sides blaming each other.\nAttacks have also been directed at humanitarian workers, complicating delivery of relief services on which hundreds of thousands of the displaced depend.
