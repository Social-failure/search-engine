Buoyed by higher U.S. yields, the dollar index against a basket of six major currencies was at 89.336, having bounced away overnight from a three-year low of 88.438 plumbed on Friday when peers like the euro outshone the greenback.\nThe 10-year Treasury note yield surged above 2.70 percent to its highest since April 2014 on Monday after comments from a European Central Bank official added to expectations that central banks globally will reduce stimulus as the economic outlook improves.\n“This is a rise in real interest rates, also reflecting a rise in inflation expectations. Therefore it is a benign yield rise,” said Masahiro Ichikawa, senior strategist at Sumitomo Mitsui Asset Management in Tokyo.\n“The yield rise may have bumped off U.S. stocks from highs, but a correction was due after their recent gains,” Ichikawa said.\nThe euro was steady at $1.2381 after slipping overnight from a three-year top of $1.2538.\nThe dollar was virtually flat at 108.975 yen following its descent to a four-month low of 108.280 on Friday.\nThe Australian dollar was steady at $0.8097 after reaching $0.8136 on Friday, its highest since May 2015.\nOil prices extended losses after being pressured by the dollar’s bounce and rising U.S. crude output.\nU.S. crude futures were down 0.1 percent at $65.48 per barrel. Underpinned by the dollar’s recent slide, prices had risen to $66.66 per barrel on Thursday, the highest since December 2014.\nSpot gold was little changed at $1,340.86 an ounce after dropping 0.7 percent the previous day on the back of the stronger U.S. currency.\nReporting by Shinichi Saoshiro; Editing by Shri Navaratnam\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-01-30T08:32:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-30T19:13:52.015+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
