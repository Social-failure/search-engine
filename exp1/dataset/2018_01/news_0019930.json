The increase in the average gold grade was attributed to increased production from San Ignacio which has as a higher gold to silver ratio. San Ignacio accounted for 62% of the total ore processed at the GMC in Q4 2017, compared to 59% in Q4 2016.\nWhen compared to the previous full year, total metal production decreased by 3%, to 2,892,068 Ag eq oz. The decrease was attributed to the lower silver grades reflecting lower tonnage mined from higher silver grade zones and grade variability in the mineral resource.\nGMC Operations Summary\nQ4 2017\nQ4 2016\nChange\nFY 2017\nFY 2016\nChange\nOre processed (tonnes milled)\n80,896\n81,518\n-1%\n319,964\n320,903\n0%\nSilver equivalent ounce production 1\n724,643\n702,351\n3%\n2,892,068\n2,987,074\n-3%\nSilver ounce production\n332,203\n347,415\n-4%\n1,386,964\n1,473,229\n-6%\nGold ounce production\n5,606\n5,071\n11%\n21,501\n21,626\n-1%\nAg grade (g/t)\n144\n149\n-3%\n151\n163\n-7%\nAu grade (g/t)\n2.48\n2.25\n10%\n2.41\n2.43\n-1%\nAg recovery (%)\n88.5%\n88.7%\n0%\n89.2%\n87.9%\n1%\nAu recovery (%)\n87.0%\n85.9%\n1%\n86.9%\n86.4%\n1%\n(1)\nSilver equivalent ounces for 2017 and 2016 were calculated using a 70:1 Ag:Au ratio.\nTopia Mine\nTotal metal production during the fourth quarter of 2017 increased by 88%, to 341,129 Ag eq oz, compared to the fourth quarter of 2016, mainly reflecting the planned processing suspension that commenced in December 2016 to complete a plant refurbishment and the addition of a dry tailings handlings facility.\nWhen compared to the previous year, the total metal production increased by 21%, to a record 1,086,663 Ag eq oz, due to a combination of higher grades and recoveries. The increases in grades and recoveries were achieved from more selective mining and a controlled blending of the run of mine ore with stockpiled ore.\nTopia Operations Summary\nQ4 2017\nQ4 2016\nChange\nFY 2017\nFY 2016\nChange\nOre processed (tonnes milled)\n17,500\n11,351\n54%\n53,745\n55,836\n-4%\nSilver equivalent ounce production 1, 2\n341,129\n181,421\n88%\n1,086,663\n897,886\n21%\nSilver ounce production\n182,015\n113,156\n61%\n595,720\n574,031\n4%\nGold ounce production\n325\n136\n139%\n999\n612\n63%\nLead production (tonnes)\n441\n213\n106%\n1,291\n1,034\n25%\nZinc production (tonnes)\n551\n315\n75%\n1,758\n1,496\n17%\nAg grade (g/t)\n352\n349\n1%\n376\n354\n6%\nAu grade (g/t)\n0.95\n0.63\n51%\n0.89\n0.56\n57%\nAg recovery (%)\n91.8%\n88.8%\n3%\n91.7%\n90.4%\n1%\nAu recovery (%)\n60.8%\n59.4%\n2%\n65.3%\n60.6%\n8%\n(1)\nSilver equivalent ounces for 2017 were calculated using a 70:1 Ag:Au ratio, and ratios of 1:0.0559 and 1:0.0676 for the price/ounce of silver to price/pound of lead and zinc, respectively.\n(2)\nSilver equivalent ounces for 2016 were calculated using a 70:1 Ag:Au ratio, and ratios of 1:0.0504 and 1:0.0504 for the price/ounce of silver to price/pound of lead and zinc, respectively.\nAs announced last month, the Company obtained all permits for the Phase II tailings storage facility (\"TSF\") from the environmental authority and construction has since commenced. In the meantime, tailings continue to be deposited at the Phase I facility which has sufficient capacity to allow for an orderly transition to the new Phase II TSF.\nOUTLOOK\nFor 2018, production is expected to be in the range of 4.0 to 4.1 million Ag eq oz (at a 70:1 silver to gold ratio). Cash cost per silver ounce (\"cash cost\") and all-in sustaining cost per payable silver ounce (\"AISC\") guidance for 2018 is US$5.00 – 6.50 and US$12.50 – 14.50, respectively. It is cautioned that cash cost and AISC are very sensitive to the Mexican peso foreign exchange rate and metal prices through the computation of by-product credits.\nThe focus for 2018 will be to maintain steady and efficient operations in Mexico, while advancing the Company's Coricancha Mine in Peru to set a platform for production growth in 2019 and 2020. While still in the early stage of evaluation, based upon historic production records, Coricancha has the potential to add 3 million Ag eq oz of annual production.\nLast month, the Company announced an updated NI 43-101 Mineral Resource Estimate for Coricancha which was acquired in June of 2017, and is currently on care and maintenance. The Company is completing optimization studies and evaluating alternative mining methods to reduce costs and project risk, and plans to release additional technical studies for the project in the second quarter of 2018.\nThe Company also expects to release an updated NI 43-101 Mineral Resource Estimate for the GMC later this month.\nThe technical information contained in this news release has been reviewed and approved by Matthew Wunder, P.
