The Oilers had lost three straight and recorded just one win in eight games prior to meeting the Coyotes, a stretch that has put their playoff hopes on thin ice.\nNurse’s first goal put Edmonton on the board at 14:16 of the opening frame and provided some much needed life for a club that scored only four times in its previous six outings.\nEdmonton’s Patrick Maroon tied the contest at 2-2 when he scored with 38 seconds left in the first period.\nRyan Nugent-Hopkins added an empty-netter for the Oilers, who saw captain Connor McDavid record two assists. Talbot officially made only one save before he was hooked.\nIt was yet another stinging defeat for the Coyotes, who sit last in the Western Conference, especially after they built an early lead thanks to goals by Brad Richardson and Josh Archibald in the game’s first 3:17.\nThe Oilers finish a five-game road trip Saturday at the Vegas Golden Knights before having their bye week.\nThe Coyotes, who did receive some good news with defenseman Niklas Hjalmarsson returning to action after missing 16 games due to an upper-body injury, visit the San Jose Sharks on Saturday before starting their bye week.\n--Field Level Media\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-01-13T13:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-13T14:39:19.004+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
