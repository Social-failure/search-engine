The deadline for submitting the bids expired on Jan. 15.\n“We received seven bids. We may decide to extend the deadline a bit, so eventually we can expect around ten offers,” Maric said in an interview for the state radio.\nOne of the most important roles for the adviser will be to determine the value of any transaction.\nINA has a market capitalisation of about 33 billion kuna ($5.44 billion) but analysts have said the small free float of the company is likely to impact its value.\n“Once all the bids are on the table we will certainly need several weeks to assess them,” Maric said.\n$1 = 6.0616 kuna Reporting by Igor Ilic; Editing by Elaine Hardcastle\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-01-17T17:37:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-18T16:18:11.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
