New Jersey went 0-3-3 during its skid.\nNew Jersey goalie Keith Kinkaid, who drew the start when Cory Schneider was scratched due to illness, recorded 25 saves.\nAnders Lee scored in the first period for the Islanders, who had their three-game winning streak snapped. Goalie Jaroslav Halak made 38 saves.\nAn unassisted goal by Lee gave the Islanders the lead 99 seconds after faceoff. Lee got his stick on a shot by New Jersey’s John Moore just inside the blue line and shouldered Moore aside before corralling the puck on a breakaway he ended by firing a shot through Kinkaid’s legs.\nPalmieri’s power-play goal tied the score with 4:40 remaining in the opening period. Marcus Johansson won a faceoff with John Tavares in the Islanders’ zone, after which Palmieri and Sami Vatanen traded the puck before Palmieri’s shot from the right faceoff circle sailed beyond Halak’s glove.\nDevils right winger Stefan Noesen set up Severson’s go-ahead goal when he swiped the puck from Islanders defenseman Nick Leddy along the boards near the New York net. Brian Gibbons’ shot was blocked by Ryan Pulock, but the puck bounced to Severson, whose shot went over Halak’s shoulder with 7:02 left in the second period.\nSeverson extended the lead to 3-1 with 5:36 remaining in the middle period. He fired a shot from just in front of the blue line that got past Halak.\nHall singlehandedly put the Devils up 4-1 with 1:40 left in the second. After stealing the puck from Tavares deep in the New Jersey zone, Hall skated up the ice and fired a shot that was slowed by Halak before trickling through his legs.\n--Field Level Media\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-01-17T11:01:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-17T19:44:54.066+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
