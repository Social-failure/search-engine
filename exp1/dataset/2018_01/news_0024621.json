Nevsun has denied the allegations. \nThe office, to be named the Canadian Ombudsperson for Responsible Enterprise, will initially focus on the mining, oil and gas, and garment sectors, but is expected to be expanded to other business sectors within a year of the Ombudsperson taking office, international trade minister François-Philippe Champagne said in a statement. \nIts mandate will be to help solve disputes or conflicts between communities and Canadian companies, the statement said. \nTrudeau’s predecessor, Conservative Stephen Harper, established a Corporate Social Responsibility Counselor in 2009, but critics have said it is toothless as the office focuses mainly on facilitating dialogue between companies and affected communities.
