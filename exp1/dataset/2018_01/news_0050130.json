The stock fell nearly 13 percent in 2017. \nHarley said it expects to ship 231,000 to 236,000 motorcycles this year after shipping 241,498 vehicles in 2017, the lowest number since 2011. That is at the low end of its previous forecast of 241,000 to 246,000 units. \nIn the December quarter, Harley’s U.S. sales declined 11.1 percent from the year before and overseas sales dipped 7.7 percent. Overall sales in the quarter were down 9.6 percent. \nAs it adjusts to lower demand, Harley said it will consolidate work at its motorcycle assembly plant in Kansas City, Missouri, into the one in York, Pennsylvania, eliminating about 800 jobs at the Kansas City plant but adding 450 at the York facility. \nHarley said the move would result in restructuring costs of $170 million to $200 million through 2019 but would save the company $65 million to $75 million a year after 2020.

Revenue from motorcycles and related products rose to $1.05 billion from $933 million.
