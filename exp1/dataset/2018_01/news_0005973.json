(TSXV: ABE) (OTC: ABEPF) \" Company \" or \" ABE \") is pleased to announce that it has obtained the conditional acceptance of the TSX Venture Exchange (the \" TSXV \") to acquire the Sirmac lithium property (the \" Sirmac Property \") from Nemaska Lithium Inc. (\" Nemaska Lithium \") pursuant to the asset purchase agreement entered into between the parties on December 13, 2017 (the \" Transaction \").\nIn connection with the Transaction, ABE has received an independent technical report on the Sirmac Property (the \" Technical Report \") from Nemaska Lithium, dated January 15, 2014, prepared by qualified persons Guy Desharnais, Ph.D., P.Geo., Jean-Philippe Paiement, M.Sc., P.Geo, and Jonathan Gagné, P.Eng. in accordance with National Instrument 43-101 – Standards of Disclosure for Mineral Projects (\" NI 43-101 \"), which will be updated and filed in advance of the closing of the Transaction.\nThe Transaction remains subject to the final approval of the TSXV and to standard closing conditions, including the filing of the updated Technical Report. A copy of the updated Technical Report will be available under the Company's profile on SEDAR at www.sedar.com in advance of the closing of the Transaction.\nThe Company is further pleased to present certain historical estimates and additional information on the Sirmac Property based on work performed by Nemaska Lithium in 2012. The technical information discussed below is derived from the existing Technical Report and previous news releases of Nemaska Lithium.\nThe Sirmac Property consists of 24 mining claims having a total area of approximately 1,100 hectares located approximately 180 kilometres North-West of Chibougamau, in the province of Québec.\nChannel Samples\nIn 2012, Nemaska Lithium conducted a successful exploration campaign. In total, 9 sites were mechanically stripped for a surface area of approximately 13,000 m2. There were 29 channels completed over 739 metres for a total of 506 samples (selected results below, for full results see the Nemaska Lithium news release dated November 5, 2012).\nSeven channels samples spaced every 25 metres were taken from Dyke #5. Five of the seven channel results reported grades of 1.41% Li 2 O or higher with the best results coming from:\nSIR-12-R02 grading 1.73% Li 2 O over 16.5m SIR-12-R05 grading 1.68% Li 2 O over 27 m\nIn addition, two channels (SIR-12-R14 & SIR-12-R15) were completed on the newly found West extension (Laurisha extension) of Dyke #5. Results from these channels included:\nSIR-12-R14 grading 1.87% Li 2 O over 4.5 m SIR-12-R15 grading 1.48% Li 2 O over 6.6 m\nAlso at about 200m NNE of Dyke #5 (Dyke 0+00), three channels were completed (SIR-12-R16 - SIR-12-R18). The results were:\nSIR-12-R16 grading 1.46% Li 2 O over 4.05 m SIR-12-R17 grading 1.69% Li 2 O over 7.5 m SIR-12-R18 grading 1.79% Li 2 O over 3 m\nDrill Program\nAlso as part of the same exploration program, Nemaska Lithium completed a diamond drill campaign of 72 shallow drill holes (3,414.5 m). A total of 1,953 samples, including quality control samples (13%), were sent to the lab for assay (selected results below, for full results see the Nemaska Lithium news release dated November 13, 2012).\nDrill results from this program reported multiple intersections over 2% Li 2 O. More specifically, Nemaska Lithium intersected mineralization of up to 2.98% Li 2 O. This grade approaches the grade found at the Greenbushes deposit, which is the highest grade hard rock lithium deposit in the world.\nSome of the best diamond drill hole results from Dyke #5 included:\nSIR-12-01 grading 1.30% Li 2 O over 35.05 m, including 2.30% Li 2 O over 12.35 m SIR-12-03 grading 1.19% Li 2 O over 32.35 m, including 2.06% Li 2 O over 9.0 m SIR-12-17 grading 1.53% Li 2 O over 32.2 m, including 2.56% Li 2 O over 6.0 m SIR-12-21 grading 1.43% Li 2 O over 32.1 m, including 2.58% Li 2 O over 10.5 m SIR-12-23 grading 1.40% Li 2 O over 29.4 m, including 2.01% Li 2 O over 10.5 m SIR-12-32 grading 1.67% Li 2 O over 5.0 m, including 2.98% Li 2 O over 2.7 m\nThe Laurisha Extension (West of Dyke #5). Three holes were drilled:\nSIR-12-18 grading 1.27% Li 2 O over 5.7 m SIR-12-19 grading 1.50% Li 2 O over 4.1 m SIR-12-20 grading 1.69% Li 2 O over 5.0 m\nOn the North Extension of Dyke #5, a total of 12 holes were reported. The best results were:\nSIR-12-45 grading 1.16% Li 2 O over 7.6 m SIR-12-46 grading 0.94% Li 2 O over 7.0 m, including 1.41% Li 2 O over 3.0 m SIR-12-49 grading 1.15% Li 2 O over 19.8 m SIR-12-50 grading 1.04% Li 2 O over 13.5 m, including 1.99% Li 2 O over 6.0 m SIR-12-61grading 1.15% Li 2 O over 7.8 m, including 2.27% Li 2 O over 3.3 m\nOn Dyke 0+00 (200 m NNE of Dyke #5) one hole was reported at\nSIR-12-63 grading 1.43% Li 2 O over 10.5 m\nA site visit was conducted by the co-authors of the existing Technical Report, Messrs. Paiement and Desharnais, in December 2012. The visit enabled the authors to view the core storing facilities and the stripped area of the Sirmac Property deposit and to familiarize themselves with the region. The data verification was done on 4 major points: (i) validation of the database and relations between each table (collars, deviations, lithologies, and assays); (ii) quality control/quality assurance (\" QA/QC \") data analysis; (iii) checks of the drill hole collars using GPS; and (iv) independent control sampling.\nHistorical Estimates\nThe existing Technical Report includes the following historical estimates for the Sirmac Property:\nTable 1: Historical Estimates for the Sirmac Property with 0.50% Li 2 O Cut-Off Grade\nCut-Off Grade\nLi 2 O% (1)\nCategory (1)(2)\nTonnage (t) (1)(3)\nAverage Grade\nLi 2 O% (1)\nAverage Grade\nTa 2 O 5\n(ppm) (1)(4)\n0.50\nMeasured\n185,000\n1.40\n70\n0.50\nIndicated\n79,000\n1.40\n80\n0.50\nInferred\n40,000\n1.10\n60\nNotes :\n(1)\nEffective date of December 2013.\n(2)\nThe historical estimates were calculated using the Canadian Institute of Mining, Metallurgy and Petroleum (CIM) Definitions Standards for mineral resources in accordance with NI 43-101. Mineral resources which are not mineral reserves do not have demonstrated economic viability. Inferred mineral resources are exclusive of the measured and indicated resources.\n(3)\nBulk density of 2.70 t/m 3 is used. Rounded to the nearest thousand.\n(4)\nTa 2 O 5 mineralization has yet to demonstrate recoverability and potential for economic extraction.\nWhile the Company considers these historical estimates to be relevant to investors, as they may indicate the presence of mineralization, a qualified person has not done sufficient work for ABE to classify the historical estimates as current \"mineral resources\" or \"mineral reserves\" (as defined in NI 43-101) and the Company is not treating these historical estimates as current \"mineral resources\" or \"mineral reserves\".\nAll block modelling, 3D solid generation and geological interpretation was conducted by SGS Geostat. Modelling and block interpolation was done using Genesis © software. As of December 2013, no other deposit in the Sirmac Property has mineral resources stated or estimated. In order to limit the mineral resources representing \"a reasonable prospect of economic extraction\", a Whittle © Pit optimization was completed using the Lerchs-Grossman 3D algorithm.
