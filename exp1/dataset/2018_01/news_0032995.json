I must be focused and stick to my plan. I’ll just think about my swing, smile and have fun.” \nThe 34-year-old Chapchai, who lost his Asian Tour card last season and only made the field because of his career money earnings, started the third round at a total of seven-under 135. \nHe was two-under-par through nine holes when play was stopped. \n“I‘m still adopting the same approach coming into round three. That is to use the tournament to experiment and adapt to my swing,” Chapchai said. \n“I won’t be overthinking about the tournament, (I‘m) just going to enjoy the experience here.” \nSeven players were tied for third place at seven-under-par including Japan’s Ryo Ishikawa, Thailand’s Jazz Janewattananond and South Africa’s Shaun Norris.
