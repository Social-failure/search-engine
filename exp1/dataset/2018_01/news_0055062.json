AIK was not available for a comment.\nThe Bank of Slovenia said it was considering all relevant information regarding the capability of AIK to be a majority owner of Gorenjska.\n“If it turned out that AIK does not fulfill conditions for a qualified (majority) owner of Gorenjska Banka ... procedures to withdraw the approval for a qualified ownership can be started,” the Slovenian central bank said.\nAIK owns 21 percent of Gorenjska and last year gained approval from the Slovenian central bank to buy a majority stake. In December it said it plans to announce a takeover bid for all shares of Gorenjska. Shareholders of financial and tourism group Sava, Gorenjska’s largest investor owner, decided on Tuesday to sell Sava’s 29 percent of Gorenjska to AIK at a price of 298 euros per share which would value the whole bank at 115.6 million euros ($143 million), providing AIK acquires all necessary regulatory approvals for the takeover in 45 days.\nGorenjska did not comment on the information regarding AIK but said separately that Chief Executive Andrej Andoljsek had decided to step down by March 31.\n“Andrej Andoljsek decided to end his mandate early amid expected ownership changes and consequently the changes of management and operations of the bank,” Gorenjska said.\nGorenjska has a market stake of about 4.7 percent in Slovenia, according to balance sheet assets.
