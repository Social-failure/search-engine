It also said it was a long-only fund manager which did not make money from falling share prices. \nViceroy alleged in its report that Capitec overstated its loan book by as much as 3 billion rand ($250 million) a year by issuing new loans to defaulting clients. \nViceroy came to prominence in December when it questioned the finances of Steinhoff , the South African multinational retailer which later revealed it had “accounting irregularities”.
