I am going to try and continue doing this job with hope and keep trying to improve as a coach. No-one is going to take away my enjoyment of working until the last day. \n“It’s the same for the players, this is not their fault. There are many factors to consider, not just the result.” Reporting by Richard Martin; Editing by Toby Davis", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-26T16:08:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-26T16:33:36.004+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
