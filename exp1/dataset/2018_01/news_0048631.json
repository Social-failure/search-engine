Most EB-5 holders are wealthy Chinese individuals.\n“Kushner Companies considers all reasonable and appropriate financing options on a project by project basis,” spokeswoman Chris Taylor told Reuters via email, without elaborating.\nKABR did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\nThe Kushners’ use of EB-5 visas to raise cash to finance developments gained attention in May last year, when Jared Kushner’s sister, Nicole Kushner, spoke at an event in Shanghai to attract Chinese investment into the building complex. The company later apologized for mentioning Jared Kushner’s name while wooing investors.\nKushner Cos is being investigated by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission for its use of the EB-5 program, the Wall Street Journal reported earlier this month.\nJared Kushner resigned from his role leading Kushner Cos when he joined the White House early last year but still owns a stake in parts of the business, according to the Journal.\nReporting by Abinaya Vijayaraghavan in Bengaluru; Editing by Sai Sachin Ravikumar\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-25T00:49:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-25T01:15:35.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
