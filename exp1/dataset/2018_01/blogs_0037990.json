The encased G-Class is from the first production year. A Mercedes-Benz G-Class was encased in resin and put on display at the 2018 North American International Auto Show in Detroit. Getty Images \nThe 44.4 tons of synthetic resin has been on display at the entrance of Cobo Hall, where the auto show is held, in downtown Detroit. \nThe installation symbolizes “the timelessness of the off-road legend and makes a conscious reference to the natural phenomenon of insects preserved in amber,” Mercedes says. \nThe gigantic cube was created over 90 days. The square block is 18 feet long, more than 8 feet wide, and 10 feet high. Production of the encased G-Class Courtesy of Mercedes \nProduction of the block, done by Markenfilm Crossing, was painstakingly slow. Every day, workers added about three centimeters to the cube. Once it was complete, the mold was removed and the crew polished it to reveal the encased vehicle.
