But he reneged on the deal and elections will not take place until the end of 2018, at the earliest.\nPressed on the election date, Kabila said it was up to the electoral commission to set it.\n“There are no guarantees apart from those provided by the Independent National Electoral Commission (CENI),” he said. “Elections will go ahead.”\nReporting by Amedee Mwarabu; Writing by Tim Cocks; Editing by Richard Balmforth\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-01-27T00:17:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-27T00:19:13.045+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
