REUTERS/Wolfgang Rattay ROOM FOR MANOEUVRE? A negative vote by the SPD on Sunday would prolong political deadlock in Europe’s largest economy, which has been without a government since the Sept. 24 election that weakened both blocs.\nPossible scenarios then would include new elections or a minority government for what would be the first time in Germany’s post-war era.\nSPD General Secretary Lars Klingbeil told regional newspaper Neue Osnabruecker Zeitung he expected the delegates to approve the start of coalition talks.\n“The SPD knows very well what it wants, what it does not want and what is good for the people in the country,” he said.\nMichael Groschek, leader of the SPD’s biggest regional branch in NRW, said he also expected a positive outcome, though the final coalition deal would “for certain” have to look different from the blueprint.\nThe SPD branch in that region wants a final coalition agreement to include a call to abolish Germany’s dual public-private health insurance system in favour of a single citizen’s insurance, to scale back temporary employment contracts and to allow family reunions for asylum seekers suffering unusual hardship.\nMerkel’s conservatives and leading business associations have urged the SPD delegates to back coalition talks, saying a rejection could plunge the country into a severe political crisis.\nBut Thomas Strobl, party deputy of Merkel’s Christian Democrats (CDU), rejected the SPD’s latest demands for more policy changes to be included in the final coalition deal.\n“We’ll still be talking about details - but basic things that are not already in the blueprint won’t be added during coalition negotiations,” Strobl told Funke media group.\nReporting by Michael Nienaber, editing by John Stonestreet and William Maclean\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-20T16:53:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-20T17:23:50.037+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
