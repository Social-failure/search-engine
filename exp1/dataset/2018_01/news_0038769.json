The first period fit that bill as the teams scored four goals in a span of 4:24.\nThe Lightning’s Chris Kunitz opened the scoring at 6:24 with his seventh goal of the season and his second in as many nights. He intercepted an ill-advised Viktor Arvidsson breakout pass near the slot at the edge of the right circle and wired a wrister past Saros’ blocker.\nThe lead lasted only 64 seconds. With Tampa Bay’s Cedric Paquette in the box for hooking Kyle Turris, Ryan Ellis equalized with a booming slapper off Roman Josi’s feed, beating Domingue to the stick side for his third goal in only eight games.\nAt 9:11, Arvidsson got redemption for his mistake, finishing off a two-on-one rush with his 14th goal as he potted the rebound of Pontus Aberg’s shot. The play was originally ruled a save by Domingue, but a replay review that started after Nashville’s Calle Jarnkrok scored moments later revealed Arvidsson’s shot crossed the goal line before Domingue’s stick knocked the puck out.\nTampa Bay tied it at 10:48 when Vladislav Namestnikov scored his 16th goal, courtesy of Stamkos’ 38th assist. Namestnikov polished off a two-on-one as Stamkos slid the pass just under the stick of diving Predators defenseman P.K. Subban.\nThe Predators regained the lead at 19:10 of the second period with their second man-advantage tally. Mattias Ekholm teed up Subban in the left circle for a one-timer that beat Domingue for his 11th goal.\n--Field Level Media\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-01-24T12:20:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-24T15:46:10.019+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
