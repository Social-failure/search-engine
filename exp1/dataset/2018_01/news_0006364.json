Reuters could not immediately verify the report. \nSaudi Arabia last year rounded up dozens of royal family members, current and former senior officials in the crackdown on corruption that has also strengthened the power of the heir to the Saudi throne, Prince Mohammed bin Salman. \nThey were held at the five-star Ritz Hotel in the capital Riyadh while government officials negotiated financial settlements.
