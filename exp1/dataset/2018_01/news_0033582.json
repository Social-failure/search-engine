REUTERS/Danny Moloshok/File Photo Dana and Adria Petty said that the veteran musician was suffering from emphysema, knee problems and most significantly a fractured hip that he was treating with medication so that he could continue touring.\n“On the day he died he was informed his hip had graduated to a full on break and it is our feeling that the pain was simply unbearable and was the cause for his over use of medication,” Dana and Adria Petty said.\nSlideshow (2 Images) A 2015 biography of Petty revealed for the first time that he was addicted to heroin in the 1990s.\nPetty, who was born in Florida in 1950 and was best known for his roots-infused rock music, carved a career as a solo artist as well as with his band the Heartbreakers and as part of supergroup the Traveling Wilburys.\nHe and the band were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2002, when they were described by organizers as “the quintessential American individualists,” capturing the voice of the American everyman.\nThe man considered by many to be rock music’s greatest songwriter, Bob Dylan, called Petty’s death “shocking, crushing news” in a statement to Rolling Stone magazine at the time.\nReporting by Alex Dobuzinskis and Dan Whitcomb; Editing by Sandra Maler and Lisa Shumaker\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-20T02:50:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-20T03:19:51.023+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
