REUTERS/Toru Hanai/Files This is a dramatic turnaround for Caterpillar which, weighed down by weak economic conditions and commodity price volatility, saw a more than 40-percent fall in sales between 2012 and 2016.\nWhile the bulk of the earnings recovery in 2017 was driven by the company’s construction division, the strengthening global economy and rebounding commodities have boosted the outlook for its other two divisions - resource industries and energy & transportation.\nHigher oil prices are encouraging new investments in the sector and boosting demand for equipment. Mining activity has also picked up amid rising gold, iron ore and copper prices, leading to higher demand from customers.\nThe company forecast adjusted profit of $8.25 to $9.25 per share for 2018, above analysts’ average estimate of $8.19, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.\nIn the fourth quarter, revenue increased across all the segments, with the largest increase in North America, its biggest market.\nIn adjusted terms, it made a profit of $2.16 per share. On that basis, analysts had expected $1.79 per share.\n“Expectations were elevated coming into the print, but this is a solid Q4 ‘beat’,” analysts at J.P. Morgan wrote in a note.\nEditing by Patrick Graham and Nick Zieminski\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-25T14:59:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-25T15:36:17.010+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
