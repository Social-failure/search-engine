The entire crew of 30 Iranians and two Bangladeshis are presumed dead. \nThe black boxes for the Sanchi and the CF Crystal have been opened, ISNA reported on Wednesday. \nThe maritime authorities of China, Panama, Iran and Hong Kong on Thursday signed an agreement to jointly investigate the collision.
