Four of the 12 killings of reporters in Mexico last year took place in the state.\nThe weekend also saw violence in the northern state of Tamaulipas, where Juan Manuel Hernández, an official in the conservative National Action Party, was shot to death in his car on Saturday, according to a statement from the state. The state attorney general’s office has launched an investigation.\nReporting by Sharay Angulo and Julia Love; Additional reporting by Lizbeth Diaz; Editing by Peter Cooney and Sandra Maler\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-15T02:31:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-15T02:36:25.016+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
