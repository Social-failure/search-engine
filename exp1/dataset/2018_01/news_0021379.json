Hand on my heart. PR, whatever you want to use it for, is between you and your camp.”\nParker recognized he had a big challenge but remained confident.\n“I’ve watched him for a long time. I know he’s watched me. I know his strengths, I know that he knows mine. I know his weaknesses and he thinks he knows my weaknesses,” he told reporters.\n“And I‘m hoping to catch him on the chin and knock him out.”\nThe winner of the fight will take a step toward becoming the first undisputed heavyweight champion since Lennox Lewis in 1999-2000.\nAmerican Deontay Wilder holds the WBC belt in the heavyweight division.\nReporting by Alan Baldwin, editing by Christian Radnedge\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-16T19:31:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-16T19:48:03.042+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
