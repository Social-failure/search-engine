Sophomore guard Jarron Cumberland also scored 13 points and junior guard Jacob Evans added 10 points, six rebounds, five assists and a career-high five steals as Cincinnati stretched its national-best home winning streak to 37 games.\nThe Bearcats are playing their home games across the river at BB&T Arena in Kentucky this season while Fifth Third Arena is being renovated.\nTemple didn’t have a single player score in double digits while committing 20 turnovers, shooting 28.6 percent from the field -- including 3 of 23 from 3-point range -- and 43.8 percent from the free throw line. Junior center Ernest Aflakpui and sophomore guard Quinton Rose scored seven points apiece for the Owls (10-10, 2-6), who posted their second fewest points of the campaign.\nClark made 6 of 7 field goal attempts while becoming the fifth player in Cincinnati history to top 1,000 career rebounds and also the fifth player to reach at least 1,000 points and 1,000 rebounds.

The Owls scored the next four points before the Bearcats struck for the final eight points of the half -- including 3-pointers from Evans and Washington -- to take a 35-19 halftime lead.\nCincinnati pushed its advantage to 20 for the first time at 48-28 on a layup by freshman forward Eliel Nsoseme with 12:50 remaining. Aflakpui scored a basket 23 seconds later for Temple before the Bearcats erupted with 14 consecutive points.\nClark drained two 3-pointers and delivered a dunk during the run, and Washington capped it with a basket to make it 62-30 with 8:11 remaining.\nThe lead topped out at 34 points on a 3-pointer by Evans with 6:25 left.\n--Field Level Media\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-01-25T12:31:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-25T13:27:45.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
