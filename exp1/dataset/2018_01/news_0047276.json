Sunday should be out of the four days the least windy, but it will still be windy.”\nThe LPGA generally cuts tournaments to 54 holes rather than play into a Monday, unlike the PGA Tour, which stipulates that competition must continue into a Monday if that is necessary to complete 72 holes.\nReporting by Andrew Both in La Jolla, California; Editing by Peter Rutherford\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-01-27T10:42:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-27T12:57:27.010+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
