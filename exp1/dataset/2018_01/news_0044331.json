(the \"Company\") (Nasdaq: CCRN) today announced organizational changes to support growth while increasing focus on operational execution and profitability.\nCross Country Healthcare is a leading nationwide platform providing innovative and value-added staffing and workforce solutions to hospitals and healthcare facilities across the country. Since 2013, under the leadership of Chief Executive Officer William J. Grubbs, the Company has increased its market share of the approximately $16 billion healthcare staffing market, while more than doubling revenue and increasing Adjusted EBITDA from $4 million to over $40 million. 1 During this time, the Company has reached a number of significant milestones, including:\nGrowing Travel Nurse and Allied revenues by more than 50% Becoming the largest provider of per diem staffing in the U.S. Building one of the nation's largest branch networks with more than 70 locations, responding to the shift from acute care to ambulatory and outpatient facilities Achieving a significant increase in revenue and spend under management through a portfolio of more than 80 active Managed Service Programs (MSPs) Diversifying into the high growth, high margin Education Healthcare Staffing business\nTo support our expanded nationwide platform and enhance operational focus, the Company has created the role of Chief Operating Officer, a dedicated senior executive who will drive efficiencies and improvements. All current lines of business will report directly to the Chief Operating Officer. Additionally, Cross Country Staffing, the Company's legacy nurse and allied business, has been split into two divisions – (1) travel nurse and allied and (2) branch operations. These divisions will be managed by two newly appointed presidents and continue to be reported in the Company's nurse and allied segment. Splitting the Company's legacy nurse and allied business into two divisions with separate leadership will provide greater operational focus to these divisions.\nAs a result of these changes:\nWilliam J. Burns, the Company's former Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, has been appointed as the Company's Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer. Prior to joining the Company in April 2014, Mr. Burns served as Group Vice President and Corporate Controller for Gartner, Inc., a technology research and advisory firm. In his four years as Chief Financial Officer, Mr. Burns gained valuable experience and an in depth understanding of the Company and the markets it serves. The Company believes this, coupled with his outstanding leadership skills and strong financial acumen, will give him the ability to drive performance at each division. Christopher R. Pizzi, the Company's former Corporate Controller, has been named Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of the Company. Mr. Pizzi joined the Company in December 2014 as Vice President of Finance and Corporate Controller. He is a Certified Public Accountant and has held several senior-level accounting and finance positions over the past 20 years in the financial services, technology and healthcare industries, most recently with Health Management Associates, Inc. Buffy S. White, who has served as the Company's Senior Vice President, Recruiting Strategy and Operations since September 2016, has been promoted to President – Travel Nurse and Allied. Prior to joining the Company, Ms. White served in various capacities at Pontoon and Adecco since 2006, most recently as Executive Vice President, Global Services and Solutions Consulting. Marisa Zaharoff has been promoted from Senior Vice President, Branch Operations to President – Branch Operations. Ms. Zaharoff, a registered nurse, has been managing the Company's branch network since 2014. Prior to joining the Company, Ms. Zaharoff was an executive with Medical Staffing Network, which was acquired by Cross Country Healthcare in 2014.\n\"We are proud of the deep bench of professional talent here at Cross Country and believe we have the right team and the right organizational structure to strengthen our position in the growing healthcare staffing market,\" said Chief Executive Officer William J.
