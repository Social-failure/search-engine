For the first time ever, the index did not have a single losing month in all of 2017, perhaps even more impressive than its nearly 20 percent annual gain.\n\"With so much momentum coming into this year, Lang thinks it would be a big mistake to get too bearish on this one,\" Cramer said.\nIn the fourth quarter, more stocks in the S&P started to trade above their 50-day moving averages, a good indicator of the breadth and strength of the index's rally.\nCramer attributed the strength to institutional buying after the S&P's small dip in November, and said that the strategy was a winning one going forward as well.\n\"Until we see any evidence that these institutions want to start selling en masse, and we have none, Lang thinks you should keep buying the S&P into any dip if we get one,\" Cramer advised. \"Last year, the S&P only had two pullbacks, and they both went to its 20-week moving average ... and both [of] these turned out to be excellent buying opportunities.\"\nAll in all, Lang wouldn't be surprised if the S&P logged yet another double-digit gain in the new year, he told Cramer.\nWhat of the Dow industrials? First and foremost, Cramer noted the average's 25 percent gain for 2017, calling its weekly chart \"picture-perfect.\"\nFrom the Chaikin money flow oscillator, which measures buying and selling pressure, to the Relative Strength Index, which measures momentum, the Dow's technical indicators were red-hot for most of 2017, indicating high levels of institutional buying.\n\"From a momentum perspective, Lang says this chart is a thing of beauty,\" Cramer said. \"Volume trends are positive, the money flow remains very strong — what's not to like?\"\nLang even said that trying to call a top for the Dow would be \"pointless\" given its strength and predicted a 12 to 15 percent rise in 2018, keeping the possibility of Dow 30,000 on the table.\n\"[These] charts give us a lot of reasons to be feeling pretty darned good about 2018,\" Cramer said. \"No, we don't want to get too euphoric. No, we don't want to be complacent. But I also think it's a big mistake to get too cynical — that's right, too sardonic — for your own good. Irony never made a dime for anybody. Let's face it: we've got a phenomenal bull market going here. Why don't you just enjoy it?\"\nWATCH: A year of Dow and S&P 500 charts with Cramer show chapters Cramer's S&P 500 and Dow charts indicate a strong start to 2018 20 Hours Ago | 05:30 ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-03T01:44:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-03T03:32:45.003+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
