Puerto Rico used some $940 million in clawbacks and other restricted cash to fund government services in fiscal year 2017, they alleged. \nJudge Swain, in a 19-page ruling on Tuesday, said she lacked jurisdiction over some claims. Others, she said, failed to state a claim upon which relief could be granted, amounting “to abstract declarations of the parties’ respective relationships” without application to a “current concrete dispute.” (Reporting by Nick Brown, Editing by Rosalba O‘Brien)", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-31T01:19:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-31T01:39:49.014+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
