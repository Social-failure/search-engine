I think all of us are mindful of the Mexican elections,” Freeland told reporters on the sidelines of a Cabinet retreat. \nTalks to update the North American Free Trade Agreement, which are due to wrap up by end-March to avoid clashing with the Mexican vote, have bogged down amid major disagreements. \nIn his remarks on Thursday, Trump reiterated his threat to announce a U.S. withdrawal from the treaty unless major changes are made but said he was “leaving it a little bit flexible” until after the election. \n“We have always felt that imposing artificial deadlines was not necessary from the Canadian standpoint ... I thought that was a constructive proposal from the president,” said Freeland. \nTrump wants the 1994 deal between the United States, Canada and Mexico overhauled to better serve U.S. interests.
