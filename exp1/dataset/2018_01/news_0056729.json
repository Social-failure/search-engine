REUTERS/Baz Ratner \nEarlier, executives in the media industry accused the government of keeping them in the dark over the switch-off of their broadcast stations. \n“There was no comment from the government when the action was taken, and there’s been none since,” said Wachira Waruru, managing director of Royal Media Services, which owns Citizen TV and Radio. \nAttempts by Reuters to reach Kenya’s Communications Authority for comment by telephone on Wednesday were unsuccessful. \n“We’re trying to reach out informally to government officials, but we are not getting any answers,” Waruru said. “Our business is advertising-based so we are making huge losses,” he said, declining to give a figure. \nThe stations are considering filing a petition to the Kenyan courts in the hope of having their broadcasts restored by court order, he said. “We are trying to resolve through dialogue, but if it doesn’t work we will go to the courts,” he said. \n“It’s shocking that the stations are still shut down,” said Isaac Okero, president of the Law Society of Kenya.
