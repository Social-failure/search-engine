In addition, Google — which extended the deadline from 2014 to 2015 and then eventually to 2018 — is not willing to push the date out further.\nDiamandis and Shingles say the foundation is \"exploring a number of ways\" to move forward, including finding a replacement sponsor or simply continuing to support the teams' efforts through public promotion.\nRead CNBC's full story here .", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-23T21:40:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-23T21:56:43.005+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
