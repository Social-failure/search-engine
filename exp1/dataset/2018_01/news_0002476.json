She then subdued a late fightback to seal the win in 97 minutes.\n“I knew that she is playing really hard and hitting every ball. I knew I had to be strong on my legs,” Halep said.\n“After the first set I was thinking I have to find rhythm, to stay closer to the baseline and open the court better, which I did... It was a very tough match.”\nHalep’s compatriot and fourth seed Irina-Camelia Begu overcame Russia’s Ekaterina Alexandrova 4-6 6-1 6-2. She was joined in the quarter-finals by Czech Katerina Siniakova who beat China’s Wang Yafan 7-5 6-3.\nReporting by Shrivathsa Sridhar in Bengaluru; Editing by Christian Radnedge\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-03T13:21:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-03T13:35:09.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
