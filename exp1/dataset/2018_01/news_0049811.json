I wanted to be 30 seconds ahead tonight,” said Ogier, who was only eighth in Saturday’s last stage.\n“It was very dirty out there, maybe my tyres were not the perfect choice. I was a bit on the limit.”\nOgier joined M-Sport last season after Volkswagen, with whom he won his first four titles, pulled out as part of a strategic shift to help the German carmaker overcome a costly emissions scandal.\nTanak also struggled with the dirt and mud in the 13th stage.\n“In the dirty places the tyres were good but in the dry they were overheating a bit,” he said.\n“It’s difficult to have the perfect tyre in this stage.”\nReporting by Julien Pretot; Editing by Christian Radnedge\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-27T18:39:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-27T19:03:06.006+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
