He expects a slightly negative market reaction to the results. \nPKN’s so-called EBITDA LIFO, or earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation, excluding the impact of impairment and costs of oil inventories stood at 1.92 billion zlotys in the fourth quarter versus 1.98 billion expected by analysts. Negative one-offs amounted to around 184 million zlotys during the quarter, according to Kozak. \nPKN said earlier this month that its refining margin fell to $5.3 per barrel in the fourth quarter from $5.8 a year ago. \nPKN shares have gained 5 percent since the beginning of the year, slightly underperforming the Warsaw blue-chip index . $1 = 3.3304 zlotys Reporting by Anna Koper; Writing by Marcin Goclowski and Agnieszka Barteczko, Editing by Sherry Jacob-Phillips and Sunil Nair", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-25T09:10:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-25T09:46:01.036+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
