Once she came into office, donors lined up,” said Steven Radelet, an economist at Georgetown University and former advisor to Johnson Sirleaf.\nLiberia still faces severe poverty and underdevelopment and was further crippled by the Ebola epidemic in 2014-2016. Less than one in ten households have electricity and two thirds of people live below the poverty line, according to the World Bank.\nSome aid programs that ended last year were not renewed because donors were anxious about the presidential transition, and this trend will likely continue, Radelet said.\n“It is a risky time,” he told the Thomson Reuters Foundation, adding that times would be hard even if Johnson Sirleaf were staying.\nAid accounts for more than half of Liberia’s gross national income, making it one of the most aid-dependent countries in the world, according to the World Bank. Its chief exports - iron ore and rubber - are in a slump, leaving little means of earning.\n“If the new government is stable and reasonably competent, the World Bank and the African Development Bank will continue to support them,” said Judith Tyson, a research fellow at the Overseas Development Institute.\n“But if not, they may be hesitant to extend further assistance and that would be damaging,” she said, adding that there is some doubt in development circles about Weah’s credibility in economic management.\nBeyond securing aid, Johnson Sirleaf knew how it should be used and was more involved in development projects than most heads of state, said people who worked with her.\n“She has a very deep knowledge of the strengths and comparative advantage of every donor,” said Larisa Leshchenko, Liberia country manager for the World Bank.\nThe World Bank, one of Liberia’s top donors, supports work in agriculture, infrastructure, women’s empowerment, and more. While its major policies will be maintained, it is too soon to say whether all programs will continue, Leshchenko said.\nReporting By Nellie Peyton; Editing by Ros Russell; Please credit Thomson Reuters Foundation, the charitable arm of Thomson Reuters, that covers humanitarian news, women's rights, trafficking, property rights, and climate change.
