In November Aryzta forecast 2018 EBITDA to be broadly in line with last year. \nChief Executive Kevin Toland also started only in September last year as part of sweeping changes at the top of Aryzta and analysts said the profit warning was a blow to the new team. \nBaader Helvea analyst Andreas von Arx said the credibility of the new management “took a crack”, while Kepler Cheuvreux analyst Jon Cox said in a note that the profit warning was “particularly painful” as it was under their watch. \nVon Arx said it was the magnitude of the EBITDA shortfall that had been a surprise and not the fact that it would be behind 2017, adding that he expects Aryzta’s share price to remain low until a sustainable stabilization in profitability. \nAryzta’s shares were down 20.3 percent to 30.09 Swiss francs at 0850 GMT and were heading for their worst single-day percentage decline since Jan. 24, 2017, the day it issued a major profit warning for last fiscal year. \nAryzta said underperformance in Europe was likely to account for about 20 percent of the shortfall relative to previous expectations, in stark contrast with its view in November, when it trumpeted broadly based growth across the region. \nIt said Brexit-related pressures were hurting its British business and higher distribution and labour costs were denting profit in the United States.
