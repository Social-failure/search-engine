Telecom companies stand to benefit because they are primarily domestic businesses.\nVerizon also said it expects a separate accounting change implemented on Jan. 1, 2018 to increase pre-tax retained earnings by $4 billion to $4.6 billion.\nReporting by Anjali Athavaley; Editing by Sandra Maler and Lisa Shumaker\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-18T00:11:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-18T00:24:17.004+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
