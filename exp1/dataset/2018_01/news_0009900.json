It’s fantastic he’s agreed to join the team,” Ainslie said in a statement on Wednesday. \n“Adding his skillset and experience to our technical line up has greatly strengthened our challenge to win the 36th Americas Cup.” \nAinslie plans to challenge holders Emirates Team New Zealand for the next America’s Cup in 2021. \nThe 40-year-old Briton and his crew failed in their first attempt to win the “Auld Mug” last year in Bermuda, where New Zealand trounced Oracle founder Larry Ellison’s team in state-of-the-art foiling catamarans. \nNew Zealand get the right to choose what type of boat to sail in and have opted for a monohull design rather than the multihull catamarans used in Bermuda.
