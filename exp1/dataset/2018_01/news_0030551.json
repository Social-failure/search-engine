Net income for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017 was $11.7 million or $1.56 per common share compared to $16.6 million or $2.21 per common share for the prior twelve months. During the fourth quarter of 2017, the Company recorded an income tax expense adjustment of $5.9 million related to the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (“Tax Act”) that was signed into law during December. The adjustment relates to revaluing its net deferred tax assets using the new lower corporate federal income tax rate of 21% effective January 1, 2018, a reduction from the current rate of 35%.\n“The one-time adjustment to income tax expense of $5.9 million resulted in a net loss for the quarter. However, our core or non-GAAP adjusted net income was $4.4 million or $.59 per common share when excluding this tax adjustment,” says Lloyd C. Hillard, Jr., President and Chief Executive Officer of the Company. “While the reduced tax rate resulted in lower net income for the current quarter, the Company will benefit from the lower rate going forward.”\nNon-GAAP adjusted net income excludes the tax expense related to the Tax Act adjustment during the fourth quarter of 2017 and the after-tax expenses related to the Company’s consolidation and integration of its subsidiaries announced during the third quarter of 2016. Non-GAAP adjusted net income for the fourth quarter of 2017 was $4.4 million, which excludes the Tax Act adjustment. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2017, non-GAAP adjusted net income was $17.9 million or $2.38 per common share, which excludes the Tax Act adjustment and pre-tax expenses of $472 thousand ($307 thousand after tax) related to the Company’s consolidation of its subsidiaries. There were no non-GAAP adjustments to net income for the third quarter of 2017.\nNon-GAAP adjusted net income for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2016 was $3.1 million or $.41 per common share and $17.3 million or $2.31 per common share, which excludes pre-tax consolidation expenses of $814 thousand ($529 thousand after tax) and $1.1 million ($697 thousand after tax) for those periods, respectively. The Company completed the subsidiary consolidation in February 2017. Refer to the heading captioned “Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures” for a reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures.\nSummary\nLinked Quarter Comparison Twelve Month Comparison Net income down $6.7 million Expense related to Tax Act of $5.9 million Non-GAAP adjusted net income down $878 thousand or 16.5% 1 Loans up $40.2 million or 4.0% to $1.0 billion Nonperforming assets down $11.5 million or 35.5% to $20.9 million Net interest income up $184 thousand or 1.3% Net interest margin 3.71% compared to 3.67% Provision for loan losses of $87 thousand compared to a credit of $379 thousand Shareholders’ equity down $4.3 million or 2.2% Tangible book value per common share is $25.72, down $.58 or 2.2% Net income down $4.9 million or 29.6% Expense related to Tax Act of $5.9 million Non-GAAP adjusted net income up $562 thousand or 3.2% 1 Loans up $64.3 million or 6.6% Nonperforming assets down $19.2 million or 47.9% Net interest income up $3.2 million or 6.0% Net interest margin 3.67% compared to 3.36% Credit to provision for loan losses of $211 thousand compared to $644 thousand Gain on early extinguishment of debt of $4.1 million in first quarter of 2016 Shareholders’ equity up $9.3 million or 5.0% Tangible book value per common share up $1.21 or 4.9% 1 Refer to the heading captioned “Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures” for a reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures.\n“We have been optimistic about loan demand for some time, and this quarter we had an increase in loans of $40.2 million or 4.0%, and net loan growth for the year of $64.3 million or 6.6%,” says Mr. Hillard. “This marks the largest quarterly increase since the second quarter of 2007 and the largest annual increase since 2007.”\n“Nonperforming assets are down $11.5 million or 35.5% for the quarter and $19.2 million or 47.9% from a year ago,” continues Mr. Hillard. “During the quarter, the largest restructured loan was upgraded to performing status as a result of the underwriting and approval of a new loan. Although this loan has been a performing restructured loan for many years, legal issues between the borrower and a third party previously prevented the loan from being refinanced. This refinancing drove a $10.9 million or 41.5% decline in nonperforming loans. At $15.4 million, nonperforming loans are at the lowest level since the third quarter of 2007.”\nA summary of nonperforming assets follows for the periods indicated.\n(In thousands) December 31,\n2017 September 30,\n2017 June 30,\n2017 March 31,\n2017 December 31,\n2016 Nonaccrual loans $ 3,887 $ 3,949 $ 4,427 $ 5,182 $ 6,423 Loans 90 days or more past due and still accruing - 32 2 3 - Restructured loans 11,482 22,276 22,415 22,551 22,942 Total nonperforming loans 15,369 26,257 26,844 27,736 29,365 Other real estate owned 5,489 6,106 6,187 8,000 10,673 Other foreclosed assets - - - - - Total nonperforming assets $ 20,858 $ 32,363 $ 33,031 $ 35,736 $ 40,038 Ratio of total nonperforming loans to total loans 1.5 % 2.6 % 2.7 % 2.8 % 3.0 % Impact of restructured loans (1.1 ) (2.2 ) (2.3 ) (2.3 ) (2.3 ) Ratio, excluding restructured loans 0.4 % 0.4 % 0.4 % 0.5 % 0.7 % Ratio of total nonperforming assets to total assets 1.2 % 1.9 % 2.0 % 2.1 % 2.4 % Impact of restructured loans (0.6 ) (1.3 ) (1.4 ) (1.3 ) (1.4 ) Ratio, excluding restructured loans 0.6 % 0.6 % 0.6 % 0.8 % 1.0 % Activity during the current quarter for nonaccrual loans, restructured loans, and other real estate owned follows:\n(In thousands) Nonaccrual\nLoans Restructured\nLoans Other Real\nEstate Owned Balance at September 30, 2017 $ 3,949 $ 22,276 $ 6,106 Additions 799 - - Principal paydowns (571 ) (59 ) - Transfers to performing status (41 ) (10,735 ) - Transfers to other real estate owned and other changes, net (228 ) - 228 Charge-offs/write-downs (21 ) - (209 ) Proceeds from sales - - (749 ) Net gain on sales - - 113 Balance at December 31, 2017 $ 3,887 $ 11,482 $ 5,489 Restructured loans declined primarily due to a $10.7 million credit secured by commercial real estate that refinanced during the quarter and was upgraded to performing status.
