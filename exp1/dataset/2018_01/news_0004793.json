Roundup is also sprayed on residential lawns and golf courses.\nThe controversy in California is a headache for the company as it faces a crisis around another herbicide based on a chemical known as dicamba that has been linked to U.S. crop damage.\nMonsanto, which is being acquired by Bayer AG for $63.5 billion, developed the dicamba-based product following an increase in weeds resistant to glyphosate.\nThe 11 states are supporting a federal lawsuit Monsanto, the National Association of Wheat Growers and other agricultural groups filed in November to stop the state from requiring glyphosate warnings.\nMonsanto said Wednesday it had discussed California’s mandate with officials in agricultural states as it proceeded with the lawsuit.\nCalifornia’s Office of Environmental Health Hazard Assessment (OEHHA), which is named in the lawsuit, declined to comment. The office previously said it stands by the decision to include glyphosate on the state’s list of products known to cause cancer, as required under a rule known as Proposition 65.\n“Proposition 65 is 30 years old and for every one of those years there have been strenuous attempts to kill it on the ground that it’s different from other states,” said David Roe, the rule’s primary author.\n“They’ve always failed.”\nReporting by Tom Polansek; Editing by Matthew Lewis\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-04T01:41:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-04T01:58:35.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
