An Islamic finance tranche using a murabaha structure will be added to the loan. \nThe plans are a step toward Saudi Arabia’s ambition of establishing a prominent position in international debt markets as part of its economic reforms, said Fahad al-Saif, president of the debt management office. \n”We look forward to a satisfactory conclusion of the process over the coming months,” he said. \nThe Saudi government started issuing debt in the international markets through loans and bonds two years ago in order to refill state coffers hit by a slump in oil prices. \nIts $10 billion syndicated loan in early 2016 was followed later that year by a $17.5 billion debut bond issue, the largest bond ever sold by an emerging market issuer.
