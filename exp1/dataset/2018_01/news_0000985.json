It seems to be a conservative target, reflecting a slow recovery in China and ongoing U.S difficulties,” Kim Jin-woo, an analyst at Korea Investment & Securities said.

REUTERS/Kim Hong-Ji \nHyundai Motor shares ended down 4.2 percent on Tuesday, and Kia Motors stocks finished 2.1 percent lower. The broader market rose 0.5 percent. \nThe grim outlook came as the Korean won strengthened to a more than three-year high against the dollar on Tuesday, threatening the competitiveness of South Korean exporters as their Japanese rivals benefit from the weakening yen.

REUTERS/Kim Hong-Ji \nThe expiration of a tax cut on small-engine cars in China also would be a negative for Hyundai’s sedan-heavy line-up, they said. \nWhile Hyundai Motor has plans to offer more SUVs in the United States and China this year, analysts said new models such as the redesigned Santa Fe SUV may come too late in the year to significantly impact sales. \nHyundai Motor Group chairman Chung Mong-koo said in a statement it would “actively venture into” new markets like Southeast Asia, as protectionism was expected to grow elsewhere. \nSouth Korea and the United States will hold talks on a trade deal on Jan. 5 although U.S. President Donald Trump has threatened to withdraw from the pact. \nChung, 79, skipped his annual New Year speech to employees for a second year in a row. He has not made any public appearances since December, 2016.
