ANZ bank said the jump came \"as shale producers quickly reacted to the strong rise in prices in 2018\".\nThe picture was similar in Canada, where energy firms almost doubled the number of rigs drilling for oil last week to 185, the highest level in 10 months.\nThe high prices for crude, which is the most important feedstock in the petroleum industry, have also crimped profit margins for oil refiners, resulting in a decline in new crude orders.\n(Reporting by Henning Gloystein; Editing by Richard Pullin and Tom Hogue)", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-15T09:48:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-15T13:02:53.006+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
