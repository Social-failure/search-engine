At least one person died in the wake of clashes there on Friday.\nFormer mutineers told Reuters they believed the CCDO members had been sent to Bouake to spy on them.\n“At the moment we are surrounding the CCDO camp and there is an exchange of gunfire,” said one of the mutineers’ leaders. “They must leave the city or we will force them to leave.”\nA regional security source, who asked not to be named, said the government had earlier in the day dispatched around 200 soldiers to reinforce positions in Bouake.\nIvory Coast, the world’s top cocoa grower, has emerged from a decade-long political crisis as one of Africa’s fastest growing economies and a darling of international investors.\nHowever, last year’s instability laid bare the dangerous divisions that still persist within an army cobbled together from rival rebel and loyalist factions at the end of a 2011 civil war.\nReporting by Ange Aboa and Joe Bavier; Editing by Gareth Jones\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-01-10T04:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-10T02:58:21.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
