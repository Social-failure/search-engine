As a result, and in accordance with GAAP, the Company revalued its net deferred tax asset as of December 31, 2017. This resulted in a one-time reduction in the value of our net deferred tax asset of $1.3 million or $0.18 per diluted share, recorded as additional income tax expense in the fourth quarter.\n\"2017 was an outstanding year in terms of organic balance sheet growth,\" said Ciaran McMullan, President and CEO of Suncrest Bank. \"We finished the year with approximately $530 million in total assets, an 18.2% increase over the previous year, while total deposits increased by 20.0% and total loans by 14.9%.\"\n\"Our pre \"Tax Act\" net income set new records of $4.7 million for the full year and $1.4 million for the quarter, resulting in diluted EPS (1) for the year of 65 cents, a year-over year increase of over 90%.\"\nMcMullan added, \"Our anticipated merger with Community Business Bank is progressing extremely well and we are excited by the opportunities that will come with a significantly expanded presence in the Greater Sacramento and Lodi markets.\"\nFull Year 2017 Highlights\nRecord net income for 2017 of $4.7 million (1) , up 170.4% over the prior year Diluted full year EPS of $0.65 (1) , up 91.2% over the prior year Return on average assets of 0.96% (1) compared to 0.54% for the prior year Return on average equity of 7.85 % (1) compared to 4.19% for the prior year Efficiency ratio of 59.32% compared to 76.66% for the prior year Organic growth in total assets of $81.3 million or 18.2% over the prior year Organic growth in total deposits of $77.9 million, or 20.0% over the prior year Organic growth in total non-maturity deposits (2) of $93.0 million, or 30.5% over the prior year Organic growth in total loans of $45.9 million, or 14.9% over the prior year New loan originations (3) of over $110 million with average commitment size of approximately $600,000\nFourth Quarter 2017 Highlights\nRecord fourth quarter net income of $1.4 million (1) , up 3.4% compared to the linked quarter Return on average equity of 9.17% (1) compared to 9.05% for the linked quarter Net Interest Income increased by $2.1 million, up 61.1% compared to the fourth quarter 2016 Net Interest Margin for the quarter was 4.45% compared to 4.02% for the fourth quarter 2016 Total loans increased by $5.9 million, or 1.7%, during the quarter New loan originations (3) were $17.3 million during the quarter Total risk based capital ratio was 14.47% and Tier 1 leverage ratio was 10.58% On November 7, 2017 we announced an agreement to merge with Community Business Bank, headquartered in West Sacramento, CA with approximately $325.5. million in assets at September 30, 2017 Merger is expected to close in the second quarter of 2018 and is subject to the customary closing conditions\n(1) Excludes one-time impact of tax expense associated with the \"Tax Act\"\n(2) Non-interest bearing demand, NOW, Savings and Money Market\n(3) Includes unfunded commitments\nIncome Statement\nThe comparability of fourth quarter net income to the same quarter last year, and the linked quarter, is impacted by the one-time impact of tax expense associated with the \"Tax Act\", non-recurring costs associated with our acquisition of Security First Bank, and non-recurring income due to the recognition of fair value discount accretion on acquired loans.\nPeriod\nNet Income\nNon-recurring\nincome\nNon-recurring\ncosts(4)\nCore Net Interest\nIncome(5) (6)\nCore Net\nIncome(5) (6)\nCore\nNIM(5) (6)\nCore Diluted\nEPS(5) (6)\nQ4 2017\n$ 111,999\n$ 434,412\n$ 1,430,000\n$ 5,096,185\n$ 1,285,999\n4.10%\n$ 0.18\nQ3 2017\n$ 1,365,183\n$ 543,492\n$ -\n$ 4,915,672\n$ 1, 045,338\n4.21%\n$ 0.15\nQ4 2016\n$ 110,438\n$ 43,986\n$ 725,000\n$ 3,389,802\n$ 554,538\n3.97%\n$ 0.11\n(4) Includes $1.3 million related to the \"Tax Act\" and $130,000 in non-recurring merger expenses.\n(5) Excludes non-recurring income and non-recurring costs.\n(6) Non-GAAP financial measure.\nCore net income for the quarter, which excludes all non-recurring items, was a record $1.29 million or $0.18 per diluted share compared with core net income of $0.55 million or $0.11 per diluted share for the fourth quarter of 2016, and $1.05 million or $0.15 for the linked quarter. Core net interest income for the quarter was $5.1 million, an increase of $1.7 million or 50.3% over the same quarter last year.\nNon-interest income for the quarter was $0.29 million, an increase of 23.9% over the same quarter last year while non-interest income for the full year was $1.36 million, an increase of 22.9% over the full year 2016. Full year 2017 non-interest income includes $0.28 million in income generated through the gain on sale of a number of government guaranteed loans. This gain on sale income was $0.29 million lower than the full year 2016. While we currently have a number of these loans available for sale, we chose to hold them on balance sheet, which largely explains the difference between gain on sale income from 2016 and 2017.\nNon-interest expense for the quarter was $3.33 million, a decrease of approximately $44,000 or 1.3% compared to the fourth quarter of 2016, and an increase of approximately $142,000 compared to the linked quarter. This increase is largely explained by $130,000 in non-recurring costs associated with our upcoming merger.\nCore net interest margin (NIM), which removes accretion of loan fair value marks and non-recurring items such as recovery of interest, was 4.10% for the quarter, an increase of 13 basis points from the same quarter last year. This improvement was driven primarily by a lower cost of funds and improved return on our investment securities. Our Core NIM declined by 11 basis points when compared to the linked quarter driven by average loans being a lower percentage of average earnings assets in the last quarter.\nBalance Sheet\nTotal assets declined by $0.4 million during the quarter and have increased, year over year, by $81.3 million, or 18.2%. Total deposits declined during the quarter by approximately $0.5 million, or 0.1%, although this reflects the net impact of an increase in non-maturity deposits of approximately $3.0 million and a decline in time deposits of approximately $3.6 million. Total deposits have increased by $77.9 million or 20% year over year. This outstanding growth reflects our focus on lower cost core deposits. Non-maturity deposits have increased by $93.0 million or 30.5% over the prior year, while time deposits declined by $15.1 million, or 17.9%. Our cost of funds has declined by 3 basis points when comparing this quarter to the same quarter last year.\nTotal loans increased by $5.9 million during the quarter, or 1.7%, and new loan originations together with new unfunded commitments during the quarter were approximately $17 million. Commercial real estate loans (both owner and non-owner occupied) increased by $8.5 million or 6.3%, and were well distributed across various real estate sectors. Construction and land development loans declined by $4.7 million, or 27.7%, due to the completion of a number of commercial construction loans, which we transitioned to permanent financing. Loans to finance agricultural production declined by $1.3 million, which is the net result of pay downs of 2017 harvest lines and initial draws of our 2018 lines.\nAt December 31, 2017, commercial and industrial loans were $39.2 million or 11.1% or total loans, loans secured by farmland and loans to finance agricultural production were $94.7 million or 26.8%, and loans secured by real estate (excluding farmland) were $219.2 million or 62.0%.\nAt December 31, 2016, commercial and industrial loans were $47.3 million or 15.4% of total loans, loans secured by farmland and loans to finance agricultural production were $71.3 million or 23.2%, and loans secured by real estate (excluding farmland) were $188.6 million or 61.3%\n% of Total Loans\nat 12/31/17\n% of Total Loans\nat 12/31/16\nCommercial & Industrial Loans\n11.1%\n15.4%\nFarmland & Agricultural Production\n26.8%\n23.2%\nReal Estate (excl. Farmland)\n62.0%\n61.3%\nTotal loans have grown by $45.9 million or 14.9% over the previous year with 100% of this growth sourced locally through direct local business relationships rather than through purchased participations or loan pool investments.\nAsset Quality\nNon-performing assets were $0.97 million or 0.18% of total assets at December 31, 2017 compared with $1.95 million or 0.37% of total assets at September 30, 2017. This decrease was primarily due to the full pay off of one non-accrual loan relationship and the upgrade of an additional non-accrual loan.\nThe company did not record any additional loan loss provision during the fourth quarter, and the allowance for loan losses as a percentage of total loans, excluding acquired loans that have been marked to fair value, was 1.27% at December 31, 2017 (including $246,000 in specific reserves) compared to 1.27% at September 30, 2017.\nCapital\nSuncrest Bank remained well capitalized at December 31, 2017. All of the Bank's capital ratios are above minimum regulatory standards for \"well capitalized\" institutions.\nAt December 31, 2017 the tangible book value per common share was $8.02 with common shares issued of 7,007,594 as of the same date. This compares to a tangible book value per common share of $8.03 at September 30, 2017 and $7.83 at June 30, 2017. The decline in tangible book value per share of $0.01 from the linked quarter is primarily explained by the one-time impact of tax expense associated with the \"Tax Act.\" The bank has only common shares on issue.\nAbout Suncrest Bank\nSuncrest Bank, member FDIC, is locally owned and operated and offers a full range of commercial, small business and agribusiness loans, cash management services and personal deposit products throughout the Central Valley of California.
