There just isn't the evidence base.\" \nAfter the foundation was announced Sept. 13, it quickly drew scorn from the World Health Organization, which says it won't work with the group and accused it of having \"a number of clear conflicts of interest.\" \nDerek Yach, chief of the foundation and a former executive of the World Health Organization, responded in a letter insisting that the group is \"fully insulated\" from industry influence. \nBut leaders of the public health schools questioned the group's independence, writing that its money is \"equivalent to funding from the tobacco industry.\" \n\"There is a fundamental contradiction in what they are doing,\" said Dr. Pierre Buekens, dean of Tulane's public health school. \"Until we know more, we are not prepared to accept funding from the foundation.\" \nAmid the debate, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration says it's working on a new plan that would drastically cut nicotine levels in cigarettes so they would essentially be non-addictive. For those who don't quit, the plan would allow lower-risk products that deliver nicotine without the deadly effects of combustible cigarettes. \nEllen MacKenzie, dean of Johns Hopkins University's public health school, said the possibility of forthcoming regulation makes it even more important for schools to be cautious about funding sources. \n\"This an especially critical time for tobacco control efforts,\" said MacKenzie, who organized the statement from the public health schools. \"Thoughtful, independent academic research will be essential to guide policy.\" \nFollow Collin Binkley on Twitter at @cbinkley.
