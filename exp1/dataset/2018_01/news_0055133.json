(NYSE: SXCP) today reported fourth quarter and full-year 2017 results, reflecting improved operating performance and the net impact of tax items discussed above.\n\"A solid fourth quarter contributed to SunCoke's success in delivering full-year Adjusted EBITDA above our guidance range, and again illustrated the strength of our coke and logistics businesses,\" said Mike Rippey, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer of SunCoke Energy Partners, L.P. \"In 2017, our teams delivered strong operating results, which included the continued work on our Granite City gas sharing project as well as our successful efforts to diversify CMT's customer and product base, and also optimized SXCP's capital structure.\"\nLooking forward, the Partnership expects 2018 Adjusted EBITDA attributable to SXCP to be between $215 million and $225 million. This outlook reflects higher logistics volumes, partially offset by our coke business returning to normalized performance as compared to the prior year period.\nRippey continued, \"As we move into 2018, we will remain focused on operations excellence, including leveraging our unique capabilities at CMT to secure new business. In doing so, I am confident that we can again execute against our objectives and deliver value to SXCP unitholders.\"\nCONSOLIDATED RESULTS\nThree Months Ended\nDecember 31,\nYears Ended\nDecember 31,\n(Dollars in millions)\n2017\n2016\nIncrease/\n(Decrease)\n2017\n2016\nIncrease/\n(Decrease)\nSales and other operating revenue\n$\n235.4\n$\n218.3\n$\n17.1\n$\n845.6\n$\n779.7\n$\n65.9\nNet income (loss) attributable to SXCP\n$\n101.5\n$\n45.9\n$\n55.6\n$\n(18.1)\n$\n119.1\n$\n(137.2)\nAdjusted EBITDA (1)\n$\n71.6\n$\n77.4\n$\n(5.8)\n$\n224.7\n$\n213.0\n$\n11.7\n(1)\nSee definition of Adjusted EBITDA and reconciliation elsewhere in this release.\nTotal revenues from operations increased $17.1 million and $65.9 million for the fourth quarter and full-year 2017, respectively, compared with the same prior year periods, primarily reflecting the pass-through of higher coal prices in our Domestic Coke segment. The increase in fourth quarter revenue was partially offset by lower deferred revenue recognized on Logistics take-or-pay contracts discussed in segment information below.\nAdjusted EBITDA during the fourth quarter of 2017 decreased $5.8 million to $71.6 million compared to the same prior year periods, primarily driven by the timing of revenue recognized on our Logistics take-or-pay contracts discussed in the segment results below. Excluding this timing impact, fourth quarter 2017 results improved $9.3 million as compared to the prior year period.\nFull-year Adjusted EBITDA increased $11.7 million to $224.7 million, primarily reflecting higher volumes in our Logistics segment, higher energy sales in our Domestic Coke segment and lower corporate spending.\nFourth quarter 2017 net income attributable to SXCP was $101.5 million, reflecting operating results discussed above as well as $67.4 million of income tax benefits associated with the recently passed tax legislation, which lowered corporate tax rates. Full-year 2017 net loss attributable to SXCP was $18.1 million, reflecting the impact of current year losses on extinguishment of debt and the absence of prior year gains on extinguishment of debt as well as $145.6 million of deferred income tax expense recorded in connection with the final qualifying income regulations issued by the Internal Revenue Service in the first quarter of 2017. The favorable operating results and income tax benefits of the new tax legislation partially offset these losses during 2017.\nSEGMENT INFORMATION RESULTS\nDomestic Coke\nDomestic Coke segment consists of our 98 percent interest in the Haverhill, Middletown and Granite City cokemaking facilities.\nThree Months Ended\nDecember 31,\nYears Ended\nDecember 31,\n(Dollars in millions)\n2017\n2016\nIncrease/\n(Decrease)\n2017\n2016\nIncrease/\n(Decrease)\nSales and other operating revenue\n$\n191.1\n$\n164.6\n$\n26.5\n$\n739.7\n$\n681.8\n$\n57.9\nAdjusted EBITDA (1)\n$\n40.3\n$\n36.7\n$\n3.6\n$\n170.3\n$\n167.0\n$\n3.3\nSales Volume (in thousands of tons)\n580\n581\n(1)\n2,298\n2,336\n(38)\nAdjusted EBITDA per ton (2)\n$\n69.48\n$\n63.17\n$\n6.31\n$\n74.11\n$\n71.49\n$\n2.62\n(1)\nSee definition of Adjusted EBITDA and reconciliation to GAAP elsewhere in this release.\n(2)\nReflects Domestic Coke Adjusted EBITDA divided by Domestic Coke sales volumes.\nRevenues increased $26.5 million and $57.9 million, for the fourth quarter and full-year 2017, respectively, compared with the same prior year periods, primarily as a result of the pass-through of higher coal prices.

CMT achieved record volumes in 2017, including higher throughput on take-or-pay contracts, which resulted in higher revenues throughout 2017 and lowered the deferred revenue recognized in the fourth quarter 2017 for take-or-pay volume shortfalls as compared to same prior year period.\nCorporate and Other\nCorporate and other costs improved $0.8 million and $1.9 million, to $3.5 million and $15.3 million for the fourth quarter and full-year 2017, respectively, compared with the same prior year periods, primarily as a result of lower professional service costs as well as favorable period-over-period, mark-to-market adjustments in deferred compensation driven by changes in the Partnership's unit price. Additionally, the full-year 2017 was favorably impacted by lower costs incurred to resolve certain legal matters as compared to the prior year.\nRELATED COMMUNICATIONS\nToday, we will host an investor conference call at 10:00 a.m. Eastern Time (9:00 a.m. Central Time).

In our cokemaking business, we utilize an innovative heat-recovery technology that captures excess heat for steam or electrical power generation and have long-term, take-or-pay coke contracts that pass through commodity and certain operating costs. Our logistics terminals have the collective capacity to mix and transload more than 40 million tons of material each year and are strategically located to reach Gulf Coast, East Coast, Great Lakes and international ports. SXCP's General Partner is a wholly owned subsidiary of SunCoke Energy, Inc. (NYSE: SXC), which has more than 50 years of cokemaking experience serving the integrated steel industry. To learn more about SunCoke Energy Partners, L.P., visit our website at www.suncoke.com .\nDEFINITIONS\nAdjusted EBITDA represents earnings before interest, (gain) loss on extinguishment of debt, taxes, depreciation and amortization (\"EBITDA\"), adjusted for changes to our contingent consideration liability related to our acquisition of CMT and the expiration of certain acquired contractual obligations. Adjusted EBITDA does not represent and should not be considered an alternative to net income or operating income under GAAP and may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures in other businesses. Management believes Adjusted EBITDA is an important measure of the operating performance and liquidity of the Partnership's net assets and its ability to incur and service debt, fund capital expenditures and make distributions. Adjusted EBITDA provides useful information to investors because it highlights trends in our business that may not otherwise be apparent when relying solely on GAAP measures and because it eliminates items that have less bearing on our operating performance and liquidity. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are not measures calculated in accordance with GAAP, and they should not be considered an alternative to net income, operating cash flow or any other measure of financial performance presented in accordance with GAAP. Adjusted EBITDA attributable to SXCP equals Adjusted EBITDA less Adjusted EBITDA attributable to noncontrolling interests. Distributable Cash Flow equals Adjusted EBITDA plus sponsor support and Coal Logistics deferred revenue, less net cash paid for interest expense, ongoing capital expenditures, accruals for replacement capital expenditures, and cash distributions to noncontrolling interests; plus amounts received under the Omnibus Agreement and acquisition expenses deemed to be Expansion Capital under our Partnership Agreement. Distributable Cash Flow is a non-GAAP supplemental financial measure that management and external users of SXCP's financial statements, such as industry analysts, investors, lenders and rating agencies use to assess: SXCP's operating performance as compared to other publicly traded partnerships, without regard to historical cost basis; the ability of SXCP's assets to generate sufficient cash flow to make distributions to SXCP's unitholders; SXCP's ability to incur and service debt and fund capital expenditures; and the viability of acquisitions and other capital expenditure projects and the returns on investment of various investment opportunities.\nWe believe that Distributable Cash Flow provides useful information to investors in assessing SXCP's financial condition and results of operations. Distributable Cash Flow should not be considered an alternative to net income, operating income, cash flows from operating activities, or any other measure of financial performance or liquidity presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). Distributable Cash Flow has important limitations as an analytical tool because it excludes some, but not all, items that affect net income and net cash provided by operating activities and used in investing activities. Additionally, because Distributable Cash Flow may be defined differently by other companies in the industry, our definition of Distributable Cash Flow may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies, thereby diminishing its utility.\nDistributable Cash Flow Coverage Ratio equals Distributable Cash Flow divided by estimated distributions to the limited and general partners. Operating Cash Flow Coverage Ratio equals net cash provided by operating activities divided by total estimated distributions to the limited and general partners. Operating cash flow is generally expected to be higher than Distributable Cash Flow as Distributable Cash Flow is further reduced by certain cash reserves including capital expenditures, an investing cash flow item. Additionally, Distributable Cash Flow represents only the Partnership's share of available cash by excluding Adjusted EBITDA attributable to noncontrolling interest, while operating cash flow is reported on a consolidated basis. Ongoing capital expenditures (\"capex\") are capital expenditures made to maintain the existing operating capacity of our assets and/or to extend their useful lives. Ongoing capex also includes new equipment that improves the efficiency, reliability or effectiveness of existing assets. Ongoing capex does not include normal repairs and maintenance, which are expensed as incurred, or significant capital expenditures. For purposes of calculating distributable cash flow, the portion of ongoing capex attributable to SXCP is used. Replacement capital expenditures (\"capex\") represents an annual accrual necessary to fund SXCP's share of the estimated costs to replace or rebuild our facilities at the end of their working lives. This accrual is estimated based on the average quarterly anticipated replacement capital that we expect to incur over the long term to replace our major capital assets at the end of their working lives. The replacement capex accrual estimate will be subject to review and prospective change by SXCP's general partner at least annually and whenever an event occurs that causes a material adjustment of replacement capex, provided such change is approved by our conflicts committee.\nFORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS\nSome of the statements included in this press release constitute \"forward-looking statements.\" Forward-looking statements include all statements that are not historical facts and may be identified by the use of such words as \"believe,\" \"expect,\" \"plan,\" \"project,\" \"intend,\" \"anticipate,\" \"estimate,\" \"predict,\" \"potential,\" \"continue,\" \"may,\" \"will,\" \"should\" or the negative of these terms or similar expressions.
