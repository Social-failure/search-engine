The stock is also on the firm's \"Best Ideas List.\" \nThe analyst noted that EA shares have \"traded down significantly\" since the end of October. The stock declined 12 percent during the last two months of 2017 versus the S&P 500's 4 percent gain. \n\"The initial catalyst was weaker-than-expected Q3:18 guidance, which suggested sagging expectations for Star Wars Battlefront II,\" he wrote. \"Downward pressure was exacerbated by criticism of the title's MTX model, which EA pulled before launch, as well as a broader sector sell-off.\" \nElectronic Arts announced Nov. 16, a day before the \"Star Wars Battlefront II\" game's official launch, that it is temporarily turning off all in-game purchases for the game in response to negative sentiment from gamers on social media. \nPachter is optimistic over EA's title pipeline in fiscal 2019, which begins in April. Upcoming titles include \"Anthem,\" \"FIFA World Cup,\" the next \"Battefield\" game and \"Titanfall 3.\" \n\"The Street's FY:19 expectations may prove to be too conservative given EA's loaded lineup,\" he wrote.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-02T18:05:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-02T18:15:49.008+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
