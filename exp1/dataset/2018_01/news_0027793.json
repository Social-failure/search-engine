The application process closed up by October , and just recently it was suspected the e-commerce giant may have dropped a clue with reported expansion plans in Boston . \nAmazon (amzn) has said it plans to invest over $5 billion in construction and produce many as 50,000 high-paying jobs at HQ2, with the further promise of “tens of thousands of additional jobs” as well as billions of dollars more in additional investment in the host city—prompting a flurry of ( sometimes outlandish ) bids from cities and states to woo CEO Jeff Bezos and company. (Although not everyone was eager to roll out the red carpet to Amazon, with one city even telling the company not to bother considering it.) \nA final decision is expected by the end of the year.
