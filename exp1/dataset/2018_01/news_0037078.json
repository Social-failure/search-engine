Chinese authorities said he was released in October last year, although his whereabouts remained unclear.\nA Swedish Foreign Ministry official would not comment on what had happened but said Sweden was aware and would be able to provide more information, probably later on Monday.\n“The Swedish Government is fully aware of what happened on Jan. 20. Firm actions have been taken at a high political level and we have been in contact with Chinese officials who have promised us immediate information about his condition,” Patric Nilsson said.\nGui Minhai had been kept in China and forced to report regularly to the police, his daughter, Angela Gui, told the New York Times by phone from Britain, where she is a graduate student.\nChinese authorities have said Gui was involved in a traffic accident in 2003, although that has been questioned by his family.\nChina’s foreign ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment, and Reuters was not immediately able to reach Angela Gui.
