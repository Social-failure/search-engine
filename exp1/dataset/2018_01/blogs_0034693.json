He was told to stay home Monday on furlough, or temporary unpaid leave. 3 Hours Ago | 01:47 \nPatrick Conway, 62, didn't report for work on Monday because he's a \"non-essential\" worker. \nConway is the chief knowledge officer in the Department of the Army assigned to a four-star command. His job involves studying how knowledge is shared through teams within the armed forces. He doesn't consider his duties as non-essential. \n\"It's kind of a slap in the face,\" he said. \"There are things not getting done and those things not getting done have a ripple effect.\" \nConway made it clear that these are his personal views. He is not speaking on behalf of the Department of the Army. \nConway is one of hundreds of thousands of federal workers who are collateral damage in the budget battle between Republicans and Democrats to get government operations going again. \"There are things not getting done and those things not getting done have a ripple effect.\" -Patrick Conway, chief knowledge officer in the Department of the Army \nDuring government shutdowns, \"essential\" workers, including those dealing with public safety and national security, continue working. Conway, like other \"non-essential\" workers, has been told to stay home on furlough, or temporary unpaid leave. \nAt the top of his field, Conway makes more than $130,000 a year but is not prepared for an extended unpaid leave. \n\"It's not like people in the government are at the high end of the income ladder and always have huge savings that they can tap into,\" he said. \nIn addition, payments for health insurance, medical insurance and life insurance are automatically deducted from Conway's paycheck. \"If you don't get paid, that cannot be paid,\" he said. \nNon-essential employees, like Conway, who are furloughed get back pay as soon as lawmakers reach a budget deal. \nBut for them, Congress has to take an extra step to authorize it. That's something lawmakers have done in the past. \nThe last government shutdown in October 2013 lasted more than two weeks and more than 800,000 federal employees were furloughed. \nMore from Personal Finance:", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-22T21:50:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-22T22:35:52.029+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
