China will continue to support the globalisation and the free trade flow,” he said, adding that a trade war with the United States would be “no good for anyone”. \nTrump said last week the United States was considering imposing a big “fine” as part of a probe into China’s alleged theft of intellectual property, the clearest indication that his administration would take retaliatory trade action.
