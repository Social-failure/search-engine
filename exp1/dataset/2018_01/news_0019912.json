Nigeria’s Globacom and Bharti Airtel’s local subsidiary have also submitted bids, sources say.\nSince the debt issue, 9mobile, the country’s fourth biggest operator, has lost subscribers. In October its total number of users had fallen to 17.1 million, giving it a 12.2 percent market share, from 20 million subscribers with a 14 percent share earlier this year, the telecoms regulator said.\nSouth Africa’s MTN, the market leader has 36.1 percent.
