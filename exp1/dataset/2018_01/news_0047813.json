With the number of runs we have on the board, we think we can bowl them out (for less).” \nThe pitch, which offered both bounce and prodigious lateral movement, is likely to deteriorate as it bakes under the Highveld sun for a few days, posing an even greater challenge for a South African side that has to bat last. \n“There was a lot of deviation ... as the game progresses it will get harder to bat on,” Pujara said. \n“I never felt in on this pitch. If we bowl well, we have a very good chance. It’s as good as scoring 300 on any normal pitch. Our bowlers are used to bowling better lengths than the South Africans did.” \nThe home side have   lead after wins in Cape Town and Pretoria but can seal a first clean-sweep against India if they win at The Wanderers.
