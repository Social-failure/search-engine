The unit has benefited from working with Apple on hearing aids that stream from Apple devices. \nThe hearing aid unit accounts for 60 percent of GN’s revenue, while the audio division contributes 40 percent. \nGN will produce the devices at its U.S. manufacturing site in Minnesota. It did not disclose the price of the device. \n($1 = 5.9771 Danish crowns)", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-30T11:47:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-30T12:24:22.032+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
