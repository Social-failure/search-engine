In October, house price growth slipped to a five-year low of 3.9 percent. \nThe December data suggests the country’s house price boom has got some life left, despite the Reserve Bank of New Zealand in November predicting a continued slowdown. \nThe central bank also announced it would ease back its macro-prudential mortgage lending curbs at the start of 2018. \n“The slight easing in LVR restrictions by the Reserve Bank due this month is likely to help improve activity and demand in housing the market as we move through the summer months,” Rush said. \nThe index is now 61.6 percent above the market’s previous peak in late 2007. \nHouse prices in the Auckland, the country’s commercial centre were 0.4 percent higher in the year to December, compared with a 0.5 percent drop the month before.
