Both have denied the allegations.\nFormer Democratic Senator Al Franken of Minnesota, Democratic Representative John Conyers and Republican Representative Trent Franks resigned from Congress following misconduct allegations. Those lawmakers have also denied the allegations.\nReporting by Eric Beech; Editing by Eric Walsh and Lisa Shumaker\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-26T04:29:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-26T05:17:38.005+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
