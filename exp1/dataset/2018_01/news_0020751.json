REUTERS/Arnd Wiegmann /File Photo Sales in China fell sharply, though PSA said sales have shown signs of stabilising in recent months. Chief Executive Jean-Philippe Imparato told BFM TV that he was far more confident on China than a year ago. \nPSA said it increased market share in all of its main European countries apart from the United Kingdom, where the company is grappling with difficulties at the Opel-Vauxhall business acquired last year. \nThe group also reported solid sales for Peugeot and Citroen light commercial vehicles (LCV) in overseas markets in the Middle East, Latin America and Asia. \nIn 2016 the company unveiled a strategic plan that built on a previous two-year recovery that hauled the company back from near-bankruptcy to its highest profitability in 14 years, helped by a government-led bailout. \n“We currently hold Peugeot shares in our portfolio,” said Roche Brune Asset Management fund manager Meriem Mokdad. “The quality of the company has improved, with returns on capital coming back to a level above that of the automobile sector.” \nReporting by Sudip Kar-Gupta and Gilles Guillaume; Editing by Richard Lough and David Goodman\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-16T14:06:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-16T14:21:07.002+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
