An SSI official declined to comment and referred Reuters to its legal representative.\nSSI employed 500 people at the Davao call center and since the fire said it would not comment until after investigations were concluded. NCCC has insisted it had met safety requirements.\nFour fire officials being questioned over the blaze have been relieved of their duties after initial findings from a probe showed they have “some liabilities” a government investigator said on Monday.\nReporting by Karen Lema; Editing by Martin Petty and Michael Perry\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-03T03:13:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-03T03:24:45.007+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
