You never know. It happened in 2012 to us so why not?” \nJose Mourinho has faced criticism for United’s more conservative approach against the top teams this season, including their 0-0 draw against Liverpool at Anfield in October. \nJones, however, is satisfied with the manager’s tactical plans and believes the results prove the club are on the right track. \n“People will criticise, people will have their own comments, views, but we don’t care too much about that to be honest,” Jones added. \n“We do what we do best, we set up the way the manager wants us to play and it works. We’re doing well, we need to keep going. It’s another big game on Saturday against Burnley.” \nUnited visit Burnley, who secured a 2-2 draw at Old Trafford in the reverse fixture last month.
