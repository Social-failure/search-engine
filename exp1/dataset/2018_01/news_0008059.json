If they are roads, they cannot be one-way,” he said.\nUnveiled in 2013, the Belt and Road project is aimed at connecting China by land and sea to Southeast Asia, Pakistan and Central Asia, and beyond to the Middle East, Europe and Africa.\nXi pledged $124 billion for the plan at a summit in May but it has faced suspicion in Western capitals that it is intended more to assert Chinese influence than Beijing’s professed desire to spread prosperity.\nReporting by Michel Rose; Editing by Paul Tait\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-01-08T14:57:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-08T14:05:50.004+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
