Fiat Chrysler also is investing more than $1 billion at a truck factory near Detroit to produce heavy-duty versions of the Ram pickup starting in 2020. The plant will add 2,500 jobs, according to a statement. \nFiat Chrysler is paying double the bonus that phone carrier AT&T (t) said it would pay workers after President Donald Trump and Congress cut the U.S. corporate tax rate to 21% from 35% late last year. Wal-Mart (wmt) said earlier Thursday it will boost wages to $11 an hour and also write checks for as much $1,000 to employees. \nThe investment follows a dramatic jump in Fiat Chrysler stock amid optimism about its product lineup being revamped with fresh trucks and sport utility vehicles. The companyâ€™s U.S.-listed shares have surged 31% already this year after almost doubling in 2017. The automaker is set to reveal revamped Ram 1500 and Jeep SUV models at the Detroit auto show next week.
