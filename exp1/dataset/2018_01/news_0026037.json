I want to be playing someone that has challenged me,” Sharapova said. \n“I want to be playing someone that’s on a hot streak and playing well. These are the players I should be playing and beating, as well. I expect that from myself.” (Reporting by Martyn Herman; Editing by John O‘Brien)", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-16T05:40:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-16T06:05:54.002+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
