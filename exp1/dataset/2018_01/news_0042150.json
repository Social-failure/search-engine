For this year, the Ifo institute expects an economic expansion of 2.6 percent. \nIn another positive sign for more growth to come, a survey among purchasing managers showed on Wednesday that Germany’s private sector continued to grow robustly in January, propelled by both factories and services activity. \n“For the next government, the tailwind could hardly be better to put Germany on a stable foundation in the long term,” KfW chief economist Joerg Zeuner said, adding more investments were needed, especially in education and digitization. \n“France and the other partners are ready to develop the EU - this is a huge opportunity for our strong export-oriented country,” Zeuner said.
