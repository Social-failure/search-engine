Ian Mahinmi scored 17 points off the bench for the Wizards. Wall also had nine assists and three key blocks. Washingtonâ€™s Marcin Gortat was dominant inside, finishing with 12 points and 11 rebounds.\nElfrid Payton finished with 27 points and Jonathon Simmons added 23 for the Magic, who have lost seven games in a row and 27 of 31 since Nov. 10. Bismack Biyombo had a career-high 21 points and added 13 rebounds for Orlando.\nThe Wizards improved to 13-11 against teams with losing records this season.\nOrlando entered the game ranked 27th in scoring defense at 110.8 points allowed per game and once again struggled with its matchups.\nThe Wizards did a much better job protecting the ball after they had a season-high with 23 turnovers in the previous game against the Utah Jazz. Washington turned the ball over just 11 times against the Magic, and that played a critical part in the victory.\nThe game was tied 98-98 heading into the final quarter. The teams traded leads before a dunk by Mahinmi gave Washington a 108-104 edge with 7:41 left in the game. Mahinmi wound up shooting 7 of 8 from the field.\nThe Magic regained the lead, 111-110, on a dunk by Biyombo. However, the Wizards answered on jumpers by Wall and Kelly Oubre Jr. Wall came up big again and converted back-to-back shots that provided a 119-113 lead with 3:13 remaining.\nA dunk by center Gortat off a pass from Wall provided Washington a 121-113 advantage with just over two minutes left. Another layup by Wall, who had eight points in the final eight minutes, closed out the game for the Wizards.\nWashington won the rebound battle 41-40.\n--Field Level Media\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-01-13T10:55:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-13T14:54:57.111+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
