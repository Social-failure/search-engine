The FARC is now a political party with a presidential candidate for the May elections.\nThe task force will include officials from the army, the police, the air force and the navy, Santos said.\nReporting by Luis Jaime Acosta; Writing by Helen Murphy; Editing by Susan Thomas\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-01-13T02:56:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-13T14:43:05.002+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
