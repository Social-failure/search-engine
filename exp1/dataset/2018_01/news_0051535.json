These non-GAAP financial measures may be provided to enhance the user’s overall understanding of the Company’s current financial performance and its prospects for the future. Specifically, the Company believes non-GAAP results provide useful information to both management and investors as these non-GAAP results exclude certain expenses, gains and losses that it believes are not indicative of its core operating results and because it is similar to the approach used in connection with the financial models and estimates published by financial analysts who follow the Company.\nThese non-GAAP results are some of the primary measurements management uses to assess the Company’s performance, allocate resources and plan for future periods. Reported non-GAAP results should only be considered as supplemental to results prepared in accordance with GAAP, and not considered as a substitute for, or superior to, GAAP results. These non-GAAP measures may differ from the non-GAAP measures reported by other companies in its industry.\nSEAGATE TECHNOLOGY PLC\nADJUSTMENTS TO GAAP NET INCOME AND DILUTED NET INCOME PER SHARE\n(In millions, except per share amounts)\n(Unaudited)\nFor the Three Months\nEnded December 29, 2017\nFor the Six Months\nEnded December 29, 2017\nReconciliation of GAAP Net Income: GAAP Net income $ 159 $ 340 Non-GAAP adjustments: Revenue A (6 ) (6 ) Cost of revenue B 14 40 Product development C 2 3 Marketing and administrative D 1 1 Amortization of intangibles E 18 39 Restructuring and other, net F 33 84 Other expense, net G 3 2 Provision for income taxes H 207 207 Non-GAAP net income $ 431 $ 710 Reconciliation of GAAP Diluted Net Income Per Share: GAAP $ 0.55 $ 1.17 Non-GAAP $ 1.48 $ 2.44 Shares used in diluted net income per share calculation 291 291 A For the three and six months ended December 29, 2017, Revenue has been adjusted on a non-GAAP basis to exclude the favorable adjustments for sales of certain discontinued products.
