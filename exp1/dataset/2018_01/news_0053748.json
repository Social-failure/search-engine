That attack was claimed by Islamic State. \nThe wave of attacks has put pressure on President Ashraf Ghani and his U.S. allies, who have expressed growing confidence that a new more aggressive military strategy has succeeded in driving Taliban insurgents back from major provincial centers. \nThe United States has stepped up its assistance to Afghan security forces and increased its air strikes against the Taliban and other militant groups, aiming to break a stalemate and force the insurgents to the negotiating table. \nHowever, the Taliban have dismissed suggestions they have been weakened by the new strategy, and the past week has shown their capacity to mount deadly, high-profile attacks is undiminished, even in the heavily protected center of Kabul. \nWashington, which has accused Pakistan of giving assistance to the Taliban and has cut off some aid to Islamabad, urged all countries to take “decisive action” to stop the violence. \n“There can be no tolerance for those who support or offer sanctuary to terrorist groups,” Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said in a statement. \nPakistan, which denies the accusations, condemned the attack and called for “concerted efforts and effective cooperation among the states to eradicate the scourge of terrorism.” People carry an injured man to a hospital after a blast in Kabul, Afghanistan January 27, 2018.REUTERS/Mohammad Ismail AMBULANCE AT CHECKPOINT \nSaturday is a working day in Afghanistan and the streets were full when the blast went off at around lunchtime in a busy part of the city close to shops and markets and near a number of foreign embassies and government buildings. \nMirwais Yasini, a member of parliament who was near the blast, said an ambulance approached the checkpoint and blew up, having passed through another checkpoint further down the road. \nThe target was apparently an Interior Ministry building but the victims were mainly people who happened to be in the street.

That attack prompted a major reinforcement of security aimed at preventing similar vehicle-borne assaults. \nSecurity officials said further attacks were likely and security was tightened around potential targets in the city. \nBut with much of central Kabul already a heavily fortified zone of high concrete blast walls and police checkpoints, there were angry questions about how the bomber got through. \n“Officials must be held responsible,” said former deputy Interior Minister Mohammad Ayub Salangi. \nPeople helped walking-wounded away as ambulances with sirens wailed through the traffic-clogged streets of the city center. \n“I was sitting in the office when the explosion went off,” said Alam, an office worker whose head was badly cut in the blast. “All the windows shattered, the building collapsed and everything came down.” \nThe Swedish and Dutch embassies as well as the European Union mission and an Indian consular office are also nearby but there were no reports that any staff were hurt.
