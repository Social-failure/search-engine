After the Horned Frogs’ Desmond Bane missed a long jumper with 10 seconds remaining, Sims made one of two free throws to give Texas the lead for good.\nFisher then drove to the basket on Coleman and had a chance to win the game, but his layup rolled off the rim as the buzzer sounded.\nEric Davis Jr. led the Longhorns (11-5, 2-2 Big 12) with 22 points. Osetkowski added 20 points, Coleman hit for 17 and dished out 12 assists, and Mohamed Bamba scored 10 points, grabbed nine rebounds and blocked five shots for Texas.\nTCU’s Kenrich Williams, who had just three points at halftime, led all scorers with 26 points. Brodziansky added 19 points, all after halftime, for the Horned Frogs (13-3, 1-3 in Big 12). Robinson scored 14 and Fisher hit for 13 points, all after halftime after playing just two minutes in the first half because of foul trouble.\nTexas played without junior guard Kerwin Roach II, its best perimeter defensive player, who was ruled out an hour before tipoff with a left hand injury that will keep him out indefinitely. Earlier in the day, the school announced that sophomore guard Andrew Jones was diagnosed with leukemia. There is no timetable for Jones’ return.\n--Field Level Media\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-01-11T13:17:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-11T12:25:42.013+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
