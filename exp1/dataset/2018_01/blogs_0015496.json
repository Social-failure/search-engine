He said Coinone was cooperating with the investigation. Getty Images \nBithumb, the second largest virtual currency operator in South Korea, was also raided by the tax authorities on Wednesday. \n\"We were asked by the tax officials to disclose paperwork and things yesterday,\" an official at Bithumb said, requesting anonymity due to the sensitivity of the issue. \nSouth Korean financial authorities had previously said they are inspecting six local banks that offer virtual currency accounts to institutions, amid concerns the increasing use of such assets could lead to a surge in crime. \nThe crackdown on Seoul-based operators of some of the world's busiest virtual currency exchanges comes as the government attempts to calm frenzied demand for cryptocurrency trading in Asia's fourth largest economy. \nBitcoin's 1,500 percent surge last year has stoked huge demand for cryptocurency in South Korea, drawing college students to housewives and sparking concerns about a gambling addiction.
