All are offered with a 0% floor and 101 soft-call for six months, the sources said.\nAn OID is expected to emerge at bank meetings in London and New York on January 18 and January 22, respectively. Lenders have been asked to commit to the financing by February 5.\nThe financing also includes a US$300m, five-year revolving credit facility.\nThe term loan will part-finance the acquisition, pay acquisition fees and expenses, and refinance Cineworld and Regal’s existing debt. The revolving credit will be used for working capital, capital expenditures and general corporate purposes.
