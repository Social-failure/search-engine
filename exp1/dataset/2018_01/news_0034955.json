NO CONCESSIONS? \nSchulz, whose leadership was on the line on Sunday, said the vote handed him a “duty to fight for all those who had voted against”. “Let us now concretely improve the lives of people in the country,” he tweeted on Sunday evening. \nThe SPD’s parliamentary leader Andrea Nahles said she would negotiate “until the other side squeals”. \nBut Volker Bouffier, a lawmaker of Merkel’s Christian Democrats (CDU), said any major changes to the coalition blueprint in the formal talks should be ruled out. \n“Coalition negotiations between the CDU/CSU and the SPD need to start quickly,” he told daily Bild. “The result of the exploratory talks stands. The key issues can no longer be called into question.” \nMerkel has made clear that the blueprint will form the basis of negotiations but that many questions have yet to be clarified in detail. \nBoth parties suffered heavy losses to the far-right in national elections in September and Merkel was weakened further by the collapse in November of three-way coalition talks with other parties, raising questions about her future. \nIn the blueprint, there is a clause that envisages a review of the next government’s progress after two years to assess if changes are needed, sparking speculation that it might also be engineering an opportunity for Merkel to step down.
