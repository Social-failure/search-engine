That has made Dimon think that regulators would not allow it to make acquisitions to become bigger out of concern\nfor risk to the financial system.\nIn a statement on Tuesday, Dimon said \"having a healthy, strong company allows us to make these long-term, sustainable investments.\"\nThe bank will also increase community-based philanthropic investments by 40 percent to $1.75 billion over five years, it said.\nJPMorgan employed 252,539 people worldwide at year-end, some 134,117 of which work in Chase consumer businesses which include the branch, small business and mortgage operations that are the focus of the new spending and hiring.\nJPMorgan's shares were down 0.03 percent $114.30 shortly after the market opened in New York. The stock had risen nearly 37 percent in the past 12 months through Monday, outperforming the S&P 500 index's 25 percent increase.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-23T14:33:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-23T14:41:25.021+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
