We wanted to prove to ourselves we were ready and see what we had to improve for the Games. We achieved that.” \nAfter finishing fourth in the short dance, Ekaterina Bobrova and Dmitri Soloviev of Russia won silver with 187.13 points, while their compatriots Alexandra Stepanova and Ivan Bukin took the bronze with 184.86 points. \n“Not everything was ideal in our free skate,” said Soloviev, who won bronze at last year’s European championships. \n“We made errors on our lifts. But overall we are pleased with our performance. We know what we have to work on.” Reporting by Gabrielle Tétrault-Farber; Editing by Ken Ferris", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-20T17:24:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-20T17:35:19.007+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
