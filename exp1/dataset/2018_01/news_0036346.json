Trial is set for March 19. \nFights over data are common during antitrust trials since companies that are subpoenaed frequently fear that their rivals’ executives will gain access to sensitive internal data that put them at a competitive disadvantage. \nAT&T is expected to use the data to show that previous mergers did not lead to price increases for content as a way to bolster its argument that this deal also will not lead to higher prices when cable companies seek to buy content. \nAT&T and Time Warner are seeking data from five programmers, including Walt Disney Co ( DIS.N ), Twenty-First Century Fox ( FOXA.O ), Viacom Inc ( VIAB.O ), Discovery Communications Inc ( DISCA.O ) and Scripps Networks Interactive Inc ( SNI.O ), according to the judge’s order. \nThey are also seeking it from distributors Comcast Corp ( CMCSA.O ), Charter Communications Inc ( CHTR.O ), Cox Communications Inc and Altice USA Inc ( ATUS.N ), the judge’s order said. \nLeon had given access to confidential information to the court, Justice Department lawyers and staff, service providers and AT&T and Time Warner’s outside counsel.
