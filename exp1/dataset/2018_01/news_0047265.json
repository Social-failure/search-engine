Guards cracked jokes and drank coffee. His office said the prince was out visiting family, but declined to give any details.\nPrince Alwaleed had been confined at the Ritz-Carlton since early November, along with dozens of other senior officials and businessmen, part of Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman’s plan to reform oil superpower Saudi Arabia and consolidate his position.\nThe attorney general said earlier this week that 90 detainees had been released after their were charges dropped, while others traded cash, real estate and other assets for their freedom. The authorities were still holding 95 people, he said. Some are expected to be put on trial.\nAn official Saudi source said on Friday that several prominent businessmen had reached financial settlements with the authorities, including Waleed al-Ibrahim, owner of regional television network MBC, who was released. Terms of his settlement were not revealed.\nSaudi authorities have said they expect to raise some $100 billion for the government through such settlements - a huge windfall for the state, which has seen its finances squeezed by low oil prices. Some private analysts think that target will be hard to hit, given how many suspects have seen charges dropped.\nMAINTAINING INNOCENCE Allegations against Prince Alwaleed, who is in his early 60s, included money laundering, bribery and extorting officials, a Saudi official told Reuters in November. The prince’s net worth has been estimated by Forbes magazine at $17 billion.\nSaudi Arabian billionaire Prince Alwaleed bin Talal sits for an interview with Reuters in the office of the suite where he has been detained at the Ritz-Carlton in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia January 27, 2018, REUTERS/Katie Paul In his first interview since he was taken into custody, conducted hours before his release, Prince Alwaleed told Reuters that he had maintained his innocence of any corruption in talks with the authorities.\nHe said he expected to keep full control of his global investment firm Kingdom Holding Co without being required to hand over assets to the government.\nAsked if the attorney general was convinced of Prince Alwaleed’s innocence, the senior Saudi official said:\n“I will not negate or confirm what he says. Generally this falls back to those who concluded the settlement, and for sure there is no settlement unless there are violations, and they are not concluded without the accused admitting it in writing and promising not to repeat it.”\nThe source declined to give further details, but confirmed that Prince Alwaleed would remain head of Kingdom Holding.\nSlideshow (2 Images) The prince described his confinement as a misunderstanding and said he supported reform efforts by the crown prince.\n“There are no charges. There are just some discussions between me and the government,” he said.\nThe prince appeared greyer and thinner than in his last public appearance, a television interview in October, and had grown a beard while in detention.\n“I have nothing to hide at all. I‘m so comfortable, I‘m so relaxed. I shave here, like at home. My barber comes here. I‘m like at home, frankly speaking,” he said.\nHe granted the 30-minute interview, including a tour of his suite, partly to disprove rumours about mistreatment and that he had been moved from the hotel to a prison.\nThe prince said he was able to communicate with family members and executives at his business during his detention.\nPrince Alwaleed showed off the comforts of his gold-accented private office, dining room and kitchen, which was fully stocked with his preferred vegetarian meals.\nIn the corner of his office sat tennis shoes, which he said he used regularly for exercise. A television played business news programmes, and a mug with an image of his own face on it was perched on the desk.\nAfter being released, Prince Alwaleed said, he would stay in Saudi Arabia and would return to the challenge of juggling his global business interests.\n“I will not leave Saudi Arabia, for sure. This is my country.”\nAdditional reporting by Samia Nakhoul and Rania El Gamal,; Writing by Sami Aboudi and Andrew Torchia; Stephen Powell\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-27T12:44:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-27T12:52:02.002+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
