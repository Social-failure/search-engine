Wichmann, chief executive officer of UnitedHealth Group.\nAs a result of The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, UnitedHealth Group’s 2017 net earnings of $10.72 per share included a $1.22 per share non-cash benefit from the revaluation of the Company’s net deferred tax liability. This one-time item affects the comparability of results between periods, and accordingly has been excluded from adjusted net earnings per share.\nThe Company revised its 2018 financial outlook to reflect the effects of the U.S. corporate tax law changes, dedicating a significant portion of the benefits to accelerating investments in data analytics, technology and innovations to better serve consumers and care systems and to advancing new and existing business platforms. UnitedHealth Group now expects 2018 net earnings of $11.65 to $11.95 per share and adjusted net earnings of $12.30 to $12.60 per share. Cash flows from operations are expected to range from $15 billion to $15.5 billion.\nQuarterly and Annual Financial Performance Three Months Ended\nYear Ended\nDecember 31,\n2017\nDecember 31,\n2016\nSeptember 30,\n2017\nDecember 31,\n2017\nDecember 31,\n2016\nRevenues $52.1 billion $47.5 billion $50.3 billion $201.2 billion $184.8 billion Earnings From Operations $4.0 billion $3.2 billion $4.1 billion $15.2 billion $12.9 billion Net Margin\n6.9% 3.5% 4.9% 5.2% 3.8%\nNet Margin Adjusted for Tax Reform 1\n4.6%\n4.7%\n1 The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 resulted in a $1.2 billion favorable non-cash revaluation of UnitedHealth Group’s U.S. net deferred tax liability, reducing the 2017 full year tax rate by 860 basis points to 22.8 percent and the fourth quarter tax rate by 32.7 percentage points to -1.4 percent and impacting the Company’s GAAP net margin. UnitedHealth Group’s full year 2017 revenues of $201.2 billion grew 8.8 percent or $16.3 billion year-over-year. Revenue growth was broad-based and balanced across the businesses, reflecting strong demand for the Company’s product and service offerings. Full year 2017 earnings from operations grew $2.3 billion, up 17.6 percent year-over-year to $15.2 billion, and adjusted net earnings grew 25.1 percent to $10.07 per share, with fourth quarter adjusted net earnings growing 22.7 percent year-over-year to $2.59 per share. Full year 2017 cash flows from operations of $13.6 billion grew 38.8 percent year-over-year and were 1.3 times net earnings, with an increasing mix of cash generated by non-insurance businesses in 2017. Fourth quarter 2017 adjusted cash flows from operations were $2 billion. The full year 2017 consolidated medical care ratio of 82.1 percent increased 90 basis points year-over-year, as a 140 basis point increase from the health insurance tax deferral was partially offset by $690 million in favorable prior year reserve development in 2017, compared to $220 million in 2016. The fourth quarter 2017 consolidated medical care ratio of 82.2 percent reflected consistent medical cost trends. The full year 2017 operating cost ratio of 14.7 percent declined 70 basis points year-over-year from 15.4 percent in 2016, as a 90 basis point decrease from the health insurance tax deferral was partially offset by business mix. Year end 2017 days claims payable of 50 days decreased one day sequentially and year-over-year; 2017 days sales outstanding rose one day sequentially and year-over-year to 17 days due to the mix of health care services revenues. Driven by net earnings growth, including the deferred tax revaluation, return on equity increased to 24.4 percent in 2017. The debt to total capital ratio decreased 740 basis points year-over-year to 38.9 percent at December 31, 2017. Dividend payments grew 22.6 percent year-over-year to $2.8 billion, and the Company repurchased 8.6 million shares for $1.5 billion in 2017.\nUnitedHealthcare provides global health care benefits, serving individuals and employers, and Medicare and Medicaid beneficiaries.\nQuarterly and Annual Financial Performance Three Months Ended\nYear Ended\nDecember 31,\n2017\nDecember 31,\n2016\nSeptember 30,\n2017\nDecember 31,\n2017\nDecember 31,\n2016\nRevenues $41.6 billion $37.9 billion $40.7 billion $163.3 billion $148.6 billion Earnings From Operations $1.8 billion $1.4 billion $2.4 billion $8.5 billion $7.3 billion Operating Margin 4.2% 3.7% 5.9% 5.2% 4.9%\nUnitedHealthcare’s full year 2017 revenues of $163.3 billion grew $14.7 billion or 9.9 percent year-over-year. In 2017, UnitedHealthcare grew to serve 2 million more people across domestic employer-sponsored, Medicare and Medicaid benefit offerings. UnitedHealthcare grew to serve 480,000 more consumers in the fourth quarter of 2017, helping lift revenues by 9.6 percent year-over-year to $41.6 billion. Full year 2017 earnings from operations of $8.5 billion grew 16.3 percent, driven by diversified revenue growth and improved operating performance. Fourth quarter 2017 earnings from operations of $1.8 billion were ahead of the Company’s outlook, due to strong business growth and increased reserve development. Comparisons of 2017 results with those of 2016 are affected by the health insurance tax deferral and a $350 million industry guarantee assessment in fourth quarter 2016. UnitedHealthcare Employer & Individual served nearly 30 million people at December 31, 2017. Full year 2017 revenues of $52.1 billion decreased $1 billion year-over-year, including nearly $200 million in the fourth quarter, due to the effects of the ACA Individual market withdrawals and health insurance tax deferral. These factors offset revenue increases from strong year-over-year growth of 465,000 people in commercial risk-based group benefit offerings, including 130,000 people in the fourth quarter. UnitedHealthcare Medicare & Retirement served nearly 9 million people with medical benefit products at year end 2017, reflecting growth of 12.4 percent or approximately 1 million people.
