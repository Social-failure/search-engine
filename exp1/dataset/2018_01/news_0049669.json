Slideshow (3 Images) \nDumek Turbay, the governor of Bolivar province, wrote on Twitter that the violence was “disgusting and vile”. \nAuthorities have arrested one person in connection to Saturday morning’s bombing in the port city of Barranquilla, which officials said could have been retaliation for police raids targeting criminal gangs. \nColombian President Juan Manuel Santos visited the wounded after that explosion and vowed the government would not rest until the perpetrators were caught. \nColombia has myriad crime gangs, some of which operate across large swaths of rural territory and others in major cities. Many are involved in the production and trafficking of cocaine, largely to the United States and Europe, as well as extortion and other crimes.
