It is the country’s principal gateway and handles about 99 percent of the total volume of external trade. \nAll strategic imports, such as food and petroleum products, and raw materials for the textile industry, as well as major exports such as sugar and textile transit through the harbour. \nCyclone Hollanda killed two people, destroyed 450 homes and caused $135 million in damage when it hit Mauritius in February 1994. \nThe small Indian Ocean island of Reunion was also on alert as Berguitta approached.
