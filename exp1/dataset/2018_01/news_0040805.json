K. Surana said on Monday that there could be a merger between his firm and MRPL to achieve synergy benefits in the refining and petrochemicals sectors, although he noted no discussions had yet taken place.\nReporting by Nidhi Verma; Writing by Promit Mukherjee; Editing by Susan Fenton\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-01-22T22:51:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-23T17:54:33.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
