DACA was created in 2012 under Trump’s Democratic predecessor Barack Obama \n“In this country, in over 230 years, this is not ordinary,” Garaufis said, referring to statements Trump has made on Twitter and elsewhere. “It’s extreme. It’s recurring. It’s vicious.” \nThe judge did not specify the Trump remarks with which he was taking issue. But Trump critics often point to his claim that Mexico was sending rapists and murderers into the United States, his disparaging words about a U.S. judge of Mexican-American heritage and other comments. \nOften called “Dreamers,” hundreds of thousands of young adults, mostly Hispanics, have been granted protection from deportation and given work permits under DACA. Garaufis is presiding over a lawsuit brought by several DACA recipients and by states including New York, Massachusetts and Washington. \nThe plaintiffs are asking Garaufis to issue an injunction that would leave the DACA programme in place. Garaufis did not make a decision at Tuesday’s hearing, or say when he would. Under Trump’s action, DACA is set to expire in March. \nU.S. District Judge William Alsup in San Francisco issued an order on Jan. 9 keeping DACA in place, which Trump is asking the U.S. Supreme Court to overturn. \nNew York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman said at a news conference on Tuesday that the plaintiffs in the New York case are seeking an order covering people who became eligible to apply for DACA since Trump acted to rescind it. Schneiderman said Alsup’s order did not cover such people. \nTrump said last week he was open to a deal that would offer a path to citizenship for illegal immigrants who qualify for DACA protections in exchange for curbing some legal immigration programs and providing funding for a wall along the U.S.-Mexican border.
