CHINESE DEAL, JOB CUTS \nIn response, Carrefour announced a preliminary deal with Internet giant Tencent ( 0700.HK ) and local retailer Yonghui regarding a potential investment stake in Carrefour China. Carrefour will remain the largest shareholder of Carrefour China. \nA weak performance in France, which accounts for 47 percent of Carrefour’s sales and 44 percent of operating profit and where struggling hypermarkets still dominate, has weighed on group profitability and hampered the performance of its shares. \nCarrefour unveiled plans to cut costs by 2 billion euros on a full year basis by 2020, simplify its organization and store network, and accelerate its expansion into convenience stores. \nCarrefour added that a voluntary redundancy plan would be offered to 2,400 employees at its head office in France, out of total workforce of 10,500. \nCarrefour is the largest private sector employer in France, with 115,000 French staff out of a global workforce of 384,000. \nThe job cuts threaten to put Bompard on a collision course with powerful French unions, such as Force Ouvriere, which has already called for a day of protests on Feb. 8. \nBompard unveiled the plan after Carrefour said last week that its 2017 operating profit could fall by 15 percent amid weak sales. This marked its second profit warning in six months. \n($1 = 0.8165 euros)", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-23T11:48:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-23T12:14:07.003+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
