Meanwhile, bitcoin is the better choice for investing. \n\"When I look at it from the product standpoint, I think the greater demand is for peer-to-peer cash than for digital gold,\" Lingham told CNBC's \" Fast Money \" on Thursday. \nLingham, who is the co-founder and CEO of Civic, an identity protection and management startup in San Francisco , added that investors should hold bitcoin and ethereum — but said now is a good time to buy bitcoin cash. \nBitcoin was priced just above $11,200 as the market closed on Thursday, a 45 percent dip from its December high of $19,500. Investors have sold off cryptocurrencies amid fears of an uncertain regulatory environment. and a breathtaking rally that has only recently begun to reverse. \nLast August, developers split off from the original bitcoin to form bitcoin cash, in an attempt to improve the speed and costs of bitcoin transactions. \nThe U.S. has been slow to regulate the crypto market as the popularity of digital coin investments increases. Meanwhile, South Korea and China have already announced they are cracking down on cryptocurrencies .
