Access to new, prospective exploration acreage is a central pillar in the government’s petroleum policy,” Energy Minister Terje Soeviknes said in a statement.\nThe 75 licenses were awarded to 34 firms, of which 19 won the right to lead projects.\nEnvironmentalists have criticized the expansion of exploration acreage via APA rounds in the Barents Sea, saying that such moves into a largely unexplored area with only two producing fields exceed the original purpose of the rounds.\nIn total, 39 firms had applied for the offered acreage, up from 33 companies that applied in the previous round a year ago, when the ministry awarded 56 exploration licenses.\nStatoil was the biggest winner in the latest round with 31 licenses, including 17 lead operators, while Aker BP came in second with 23 licenses, of which 14 were lead operators.\nShell, Total, ConocoPhillips, Lundin Petroleum and ExxonMobil were among those awarded acreage.\nAdditional reporting by Ole Petter Skonnord; Editing by Terje Solsvik and Susan Fenton\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-16T16:53:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-16T17:12:18.005+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
