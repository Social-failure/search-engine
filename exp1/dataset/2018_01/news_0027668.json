It came in at 7.26 million tonnes, up 1.3 percent on the year.\nBeef output has risen in recent years as low milk prices prompted farmers to slaughter more dairy cattle and as the country’s growing middle class developed a taste for steak and hamburgers.\nPoultry output climbed 0.5 percent to 18.97 million tonnes in 2017, while lamb production was up 1.8 percent at 4.68 million tonnes, the data showed.\nReporting by Dominique Patton; Editing by Joseph Radford\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-01-18T15:50:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-19T12:17:00.013+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
