The company said in a notice Tuesday on its website that it's working with AMD to resolve the problem so people can resume installing the recommended repairs.\nAfter the bugs were announced last week, AMD declared there is \"near zero risk\" to its own processors, partly because of Microsoft's security patches.\nIn other developments, Microsoft also warned that some computers powered by older processors probably won't work as well as they once did after the antidotes to Spectre and Meltdown are installed.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-10T01:38:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-10T03:08:18.078+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
