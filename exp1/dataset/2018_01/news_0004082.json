The Fed also proposed guidance outlining its expectations for how banks manage their various business lines in terms of risk. \nThe proposals are part of a broader effort at the Fed to overhaul its confidential internal large bank rating system. Thursday’s proposals are part of the effort to modernize that system, known as CAMELs, to reflect the host of new rules established by the Fed in recent years. \nReporting by Pete SchroederEditing by Chizu Nomiyama\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-04T22:31:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-04T22:50:17.053+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
