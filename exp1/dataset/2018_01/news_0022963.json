In September, the U.S. firm had modified its app store rule to exempt personal cash gifts from being counted as in-app purchases, of which Apple takes a 30 percent cut.\nWeChat, with nearly 1 billion users, is the most popular app in China that integrates messaging, payment, gaming, content publishing, as well as “mini programmes” that look and operate much like apps on iOS and Google’s Android operating systems - but are far less data-intensive.\nThe launch of “mini-programmes” last January was seen by many as a threat to Apple’s and Google’s duopoly over the app-store ecosystem, but Tencent has repeatedly said it was not seeking to compete against Apple or to kill apps.\nThere are now some 580,000 mini-programmes on WeChat with 170 million daily active users, Gerald Hu, a WeChat manager told the conference. More than 1 million developers and 2,300 third-party platforms are currently working on WeChat mini-programmes.\nAccording to Zhang, the current adoption of mini-programmes is fully in line with expectations. “We have plenty of patience for mini-programmes,” Zhang said.\nOn Monday, WeChat also announced a partnership with French video game developer Ubisoft, whose mobile game publisher Ketchapp will start launching WeChat-based games.\nWeChat-based games have already accumulated 310 million users.
