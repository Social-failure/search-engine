It will also be Letterman’s first televised interview after retiring as host of the CBS’ The Late Show in 2015. \nUnlike The Late Show , My Next Guest Needs No Introduction will dedicate each hour-long episode to one guest, as opposed to several, including a musical guest or comedian performing a short routine. The six-part series will run a new episode each month and conclude in June. \nGet Data Sheet , Fortune’s technology newsletter. \nNetflix (nflx) also released a trailer of the new series in which Letterman is shown sporting a long, Walt Whitman-like beard and filmed in a more intimate setting featuring two chairs and a simple backdrop as opposed to his former show’s more lavish set. \nObama last talked to Letterman in a televised interview on The Late Show in 2015 during Letterman’s final run hosting the CBS show after two decades.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-06T15:54:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-06T01:00:34.031+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
