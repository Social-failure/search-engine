Last years Vivendi appealed against this ruling.\nOn its website the regional court said the appeal hearing would be held on July 4. It was previously set for Feb. 7.\nReporting by Stefano Rebaudo; writing by Francesca Landini; editing by John Stonestreet\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-01-20T18:38:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-21T13:21:21.023+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
