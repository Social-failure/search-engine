About 80 percent of its network will be in urban areas and the group is talking to supermarkets, retail chains and petrol stations to aid its expansion.\n“Everyone with a role in the mobility space without an ‘e’ wants to grow there ... it’s going to be a big competitive opportunity,” Piglia said.\n($1 = 0.8039 euros)\nReporting by Stephen Jewkes; Editing by David Goodman\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-30T17:48:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-30T18:06:18.002+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
