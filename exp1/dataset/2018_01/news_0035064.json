It also impacts critical missions for our customers.\"\n\"NSS missions\" refers to national security space contracts for the Air Force, of which SpaceX has won two thus far . Worth nearly $100 million each, SpaceX hopes to win more once Falcon Heavy is operational.\nFalcon Heavy is the name for the company's biggest rocket yet, which Musk had said would launch in January . With thrust equivalent to 18 Boeing 747 aircraft at full throttle, Falcon Heavy would be the most powerful rocket in the world once operational. Testing delays have pushed back a planned static fire, in which the rocket would ignite all 27 of its engines while on the launchpad.\nThe new rocket's testing and launch are set to take place on Launch Complex 39A at Kennedy.\nThis is breaking news.
