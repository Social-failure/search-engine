In addition to the threat of a conflict on the Korean peninsula, the report pointed to the risk of new military confrontations in the Middle East. \nIt cited a rise in “charismatic strongman politics” across the world and said political, economic and environmental risks were being exacerbated by a decline in support for rules-based multilateralism.

Still, the report described income inequality as a “corrosive problem” in many countries and warned against complacency over the economic environment given high debt levels, low savings rates and inadequate pension provisions. \n“A widening economic recovery presents us with an opportunity that we cannot afford to squander, to tackle the fractures that we have allowed to weaken the world’s institutions, societies and environment,” said Klaus Schwab, founder and executive chairman of the WEF. \n“We must take seriously the risk of a global systems breakdown.” Reporting by Noah Barkin; Editing by Kevin Liffey", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-17T11:03:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-17T11:40:07.006+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
