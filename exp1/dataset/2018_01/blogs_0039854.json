The company is attempting a turnaround under Hackett, who was appointed CEO in early 2017. \nFord spends about $10 billion in commodities annually, and about two-thirds of that go to steel and aluminum. The company benefited from falling prices in 2015 and 2016. But the market began to turn in late 2016 and prices are expected to continue their climb through 2018. \nFord uses a larger amount of aluminum than competitors in some of its vehicles, particularly in its trucks and SUVs. But aluminum is not the primary problem, said CFO Bob Shanks on Wednesday's conference call. Steel is the real issue, he said. \nFord expects revenues in 2018 to be flat or modestly higher over 2017, and is expecting flat to lower profits from its automotive business. It is also expecting lower profits from its Ford Credit business. \nAt the same time, Ford plans to spend about $7.5 billion in capital in 2018. The company is plowing profits into investments in new mobility initiatives, such as developing self-driving cars. Ford is battling a perception that it is behind rivals and tech firms on mobility technologies. \nFord has a plan to improve fitness, Hackett said, but he did not disclose many details on what action the firm plans to take, saying he wanted to discuss plans within the company first.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-25T02:46:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-25T02:56:27.021+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
