Boeing complained the planes were sold to the Atlanta-based airline below their production cost. \nIn late 2017, the Commerce Department slapped duties of nearly 300 percent on the jets, forcing Delta to come up with alternative fleet plans as the trade dispute intensified. Those tariffs would have made the planes unaffordable. Friday's vote means the tariffs cannot be implemented.\nThat dispute may not be over. Boeing could appeal to the International Court of Trade in New York. The U.S. government could take the case to the World Trade Organization.\nDelta's Bastian had repeatedly insisted the airline wouldn't pay the duties on the planes. It may be a moot point in the end because European aerospace giant Airbus, Boeing's chief rival, last year agreed to take a majority stake in the jet program and that the two plan to build the aircraft in Alabama, where Airbus makes narrowbody passenger planes.\nBombardier's CEO told CNBC after the ruling that that plan is still on track .\nshow chapters Bombardier CEO: ITC ruling a major victory for Bombardier, innovation and customers      3:42 PM ET Fri, 26 Jan 2018 | 03:32", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-30T21:40:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-30T21:41:50.004+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
