At least three children were killed, and others injured. In all, around 60 people were wounded, medical officials said.\n“I was there for the second blast and there was an ambulance between us and the explosion,” said Yassin Farouk, a shopkeeper who had been praying in the mosque and was one of the first to leave. “The explosion was very powerful and we survived it by a miracle.”\nThere was no immediate claim of responsibility for the attack.\nPeople walk near a puddle of water mixed with blood at the site of twin car bombs in Benghazi, Libya, January 24, 2018. REUTERS/Esam Omran Al-Fetori Benghazi is controlled by the Libyan National Army (LNA), led by eastern-based commander Khalifa Haftar. It was battling Islamists including some linked to Islamic State and al Qaeda, as well as other opponents until late last year in the Mediterranean port city.\nMarae al-Houti, an LNA special forces commander, blamed “terrorists defeated in battle, using this wicked method”.\nSlideshow (4 Images) “There are terrorist sleeper cells and they will be arrested soon,” he told Reuters.\nHaftar, a possible contender in national elections that could be held by the end of 2018, has built his reputation on delivering stability in Benghazi and beyond, promising to halt the chaos that developed after a NATO-backed uprising ended Muammar Gaddafi’s long rule nearly seven years ago.\nHaftar launched his military campaign in Benghazi in May 2014, in response to a series of bombings and assassinations blamed on Islamist militants.\nIn past months there have been occasional, smaller scale bombings apparently targeting LNA allies or supporters.\nOne of those killed in Tuesday’s attack was Ahmed al-Feitouri, head of the LNA’s investigation and arrest unit. A tent for mourners was erected in front of his house, close to the Bayaat al-Radwan mosque.\nMohamed Fathi, who came to help people hit by the first blast, suffered shrapnel injuries in his leg and hand from the second. “It was a huge explosion intended to kill as many people as possible,” he said.\nWriting by Aidan Lewis; Editing by Mark Heinrich\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-24T14:19:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-24T14:33:42.001+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
