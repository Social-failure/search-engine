It’s surprising to note that growth in the euro zone is actually similar if not outpacing the U.S.”\nThe greenback gained some respite against other major peers. Against the yen, the dollar held steady at 111.27 yen, having bounced from Wednesday’s four-month low of 110.19 yen.\nThe Canadian dollar eased about 0.2 percent to C$1.2462 , having see-sawed on Wednesday after the Bank of Canada raised interest rates and indicated confidence in the economic outlook but sounded a cautious tone on the future of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA).\nOn Wednesday, the Canadian dollar had fluctuated in a relatively wide range of C$1.2540 to C$1.2362.\nLater on Thursday, investors will turn their focus to China’s fourth-quarter and 2017 gross domestic product data, and data on December factory output, retail sales and fixed-asset investment.\nThe Chinese economic indicators are due to be released at 0700 GMT rather than the usual 0200 GMT.
