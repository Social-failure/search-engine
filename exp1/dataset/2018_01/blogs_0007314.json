It is because of the market rotation that started occurring in the second half of 2017.\nWhile technology dominated the year, energy and financials rallied in the second half, he explained. Plus consumer discretionary and consumer staples began playing a game of catch-up.\n\"This rotation is very powerful. ... We have a heck of a lot more left,\" he said.\nAcampora said stocks that haven't performed in 2017, such as IBM and Exxon Mobil , will start to take over some of the leadership.\nIn fact, he'd start making positions in Exxon and Halliburton , which he said have a lot more room to run. He also likes Bank of America to buy and put away for 5 years.\nshow chapters Closing Bell Exchange: Dow passes 25K 23 Hours Ago | 04:32 However, strategist Jim Paulsen said there's a correction in the cards this year.\nNot only are investors optimistic, but Main Street is as well, with consumer and business confidence high.\n\"When it gets good on Main Street and everyone thinks the water is finally safe it often gets rough on Wall Street,\" the chief investment strategist at the Leuthold Group told \"Closing Bell.\"\n\"Momentum might keep this going for a while, but I think we're setting ourselves up for a significant correction sometime this year.\"\nâ€” CNBC's Melody Myers contributed to this report.\nDisclaimer", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-05T02:01:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-05T02:11:07.005+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
