And some of the risks were significant. \nTwo issues—the lack of smoke detectors with flashing lights (which alert hearing-impaired guests) and missing slabs of concrete, which exposed steel rebar on a staircase (and could have caused someone to fall)—were cited as high priority items during a Nov. 8 inspection. A follow-up inspection on Nov. 17 found the problems fixed satisfactorily. \nThe kitchens at the resort were hit with 15 violations, according to the Miami Herald . Included among those was a failure to track the freshness of potentially hazardous foods, though the kitchen did pass inspections on the first try. \nMar-a-Lago, a haven for Donald Trump, has been in a harsh spotlight of late.
