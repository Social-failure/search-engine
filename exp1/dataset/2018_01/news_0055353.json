Nowell wasn’t supposed to do a fitness session on Friday, but he did it, as did Brownie.” \nItoje fractured his jaw while playing for Saracens last month and then injured his hip, while Brown was suffering from blurred vision and Robshaw and Nowell from back and ankle injuries, respectively. \nEngland are still missing several key players, including number eight Billy Vunipola, who has a broken arm, and suspended duo Joe Marler and James Haskell. \n“It’s great to have all the squad in place because out of our top 30 players, we have probably got about 25 percent of them out,” Jones said. “So to have these guys come back into contention is absolutely outstanding.” Writing by Simon Jennings in Bengaluru; Editing by Peter Rutherford", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-31T06:45:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-31T07:22:15.062+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
