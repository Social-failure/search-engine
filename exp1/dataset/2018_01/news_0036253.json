Also, supply-and-demand is seen more balanced as new lines from companies such as China’s BOE Technology Group are still ramping up production quality. \nLG Display leads the industry in OLED panels for TVs but rival Samsung Electronics’s display business dominates the industry for small OLED panels used in mobile phones -- a market that LG is trying to penetrate. \nIn December, South Korea approved LG Display’s plan to build an OLED panel production facility in China, as the firm works to grow its OLED business. \nWitsView forecast that LG Display will be able to ship smartphone OLED panels to Apple around the end of the third quarter. \nSouth Korean exporters will be keeping a close eye on the won in 2018. The currency traded on Monday at 1,070.1 won per dollar, near a three-year high.
