Specifically, the Company appoints Philip Wills, PhD, as Chief Commercial Officer, John Conner as Chief Manufacturing Officer, and William \"Bill\" Thomas, Jr., PhD, as Chief Scientific Officer, and hires Randy Henrickson as VP of Manufacturing and Dermot McCaul as VP of Information Technology.\nRecent Leadership Appointments\nDr. Wills has been instrumental to the growth of Paragon Bioservices and helping build the Company's reputation as a global CDMO leader in the gene therapy and vaccine space. He initially joined Paragon as Group Leader of Assay Development in July 2002, and during his tenure with the company has held many key positions.\n\"Since joining Paragon, Philip has played a vital role in growing our organization and helping us pivot to our new and aggressive growth strategy. He's led the way in building our current brand as well as solidifying our position in the marketplace,\" said President and CEO of Paragon Bioservices Pete Buzy.\nMr. Conner is a biotechnology operations executive who has successfully led development in the areas of manufacturing, process development, analytical, manufacturing science and technology operations. He has over 30 years of experience and has spent much of his career successfully meeting the challenges of providing manufacturing services to the biotechnology industry. Mr. Conner was most recently the Senior Vice President of Operations at CDMO, Cytovance Biologics, where he was responsible for building the operations team, manufacturing facilities and GMP systems, and providing world-class GMP manufacturing over several biologic platforms.\n\"John's experience and leadership in driving our growth, while expanding our manufacturing capabilities to meet burgeoning client needs, including our anticipated commercial manufacturing capacity in the next few years, has been invaluable to Paragon,\" stated Mr. Buzy.\nIn his role as Chief Scientific Officer, Dr. Thomas will work to continue to strengthen Paragon's collaborative partnerships, supporting the scientific aspects of product development.
