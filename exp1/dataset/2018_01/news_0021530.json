JCPOA (the nuclear deal) is not renegotiable: rather than repeating tired rhetoric, U.S. must bring itself into full compliance - just like Iran,” Mohammad Javad Zarif wrote on his Twitter account.\nWriting by Parisa Hafezi; Editing by Hugh Lawson\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-01-13T04:18:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-13T04:44:29.003+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
