The economy is expected to grow by 6 percent in the next fiscal year, she added. \nEgyptâ€™s economy has struggled since a 2011 uprising drove tourists and foreign investors away, two main sources of hard currency, but the government hopes that IMF-backed reforms it has embarked on over the past year will put it back on track.
