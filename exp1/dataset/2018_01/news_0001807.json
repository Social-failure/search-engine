It then suspended its share buyback program to fund the deal.\nThe company on Thursday forecast fourth-quarter adjusted earnings per share at the lower end of its previous outlook of $1.88-$1.92 as it suspended its share buyback program.\nCVS Health said its plan to cancel share buybacks has eroded about 340-610 basis points of growth in its annual adjusted earnings per share.\nIt also forecast its full-year net revenue to grow 0.75 percent-2.5 percent in 2018, helped by strong growth in scripts and claims.\nThe range, however, came below analysts’ estimates of 3.9 percent-4.4 percent, according to Leerink Research.\nThe company also expects to see the lowest level of year-over-year enterprise operating profit growth in the first quarter of 2018, CVS Health’s CFO David Denton said on a conference call.\nRetail operating profit would contract in the first quarter as the company would incur costs associated with investments made to grow the business, he said, adding that the number would improve as the year progresses.\nThe guidance is operationally disappointing but is somewhat explainable with a couple of one-time payments negatively impacting the company’s spending, Needham analyst Kevin Caliendo told Reuters.\nAnalysts believe that the benefit CVS Health expects to gain from the tax overhaul is driving its stock up.\nShares of the No. 2 U.S. drug store chain spiked as much as 4.7 percent to $76.67 in afternoon trading.\n“The 27 percent number versus the current tax rate of 39 percent is a material positive,” Caliendo said.\nRival Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc ( WBA.O ) reported weak quarterly retail sales on Thursday, but declined to provide an update on the tax code revamp. Walgreens’ shares were trading down 4.7 percent at $71.95.\nReporting by Divya Grover Martina D'Couto\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-04T14:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-04T14:47:38.016+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
