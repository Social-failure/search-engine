REUTERS/Denis Balibouse - RC1AD97826A0 \nThe European Court of Justice on Wednesday confirmed Italy and Milan had logged two legal cases at the Luxembourg-based tribunal to annul the November decision. \nThe EU’s chief health official at the Brussels-based executive European Commission poured cold water on Italy’s EMA campaign, saying it was “very close to the Italian election.” \n“Sorry but me personally, I think the whole Commission also is not a part of Italian election debates. It will be a crystal clear answer. The Council decision is done,” Vytenis Andriukaitis told a briefing in Brussels. \nEMA’s head, Italian Guido Rasi, said earlier this week the temporary accommodation Amsterdam was offering before it finishes building a new site to host the agency was “not optimal”. \nRome was swift to mount its legal challenge, but the Hague has pointed out that the temporary accommodation has always been part of its bid and was fit to host EMA, while the destination building would be ready on schedule in November, 2019. \n“The process leading to the decision was fair and square,” said Dutch Minister for Medical Care Bruno Bruins.
