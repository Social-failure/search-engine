Dennis has since also left McLaren and sold his shares.\nAfter leaving Formula One, where he had also been chairman of the now-defunct teams’ association FOTA, Whitmarsh became chief executive of Olympic yachtsman Ben Ainslie’s America’s Cup challenge in 2015.\nHe was replaced in that role last November, taking an advisory position instead.\nWhitmarsh is also on the Global Advisory Board of electric series Formula E.\nReporting by Alan Baldwin, editing by Toby Davis\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-16T22:38:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-16T22:52:34.060+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
