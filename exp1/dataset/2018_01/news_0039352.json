These actions include a stock split and a special dividend, as well as additional funding of the company’s defined benefit program and the creation of a charitable foundation.\nPaul Varga, Chief Executive Officer of Brown-Forman, said, \"These capital deployment actions underscore the strength of the company’s balance sheet and health of our business, and are augmented by the anticipated benefits due to tax reform. We believe the last many years of significant capital investment and portfolio reshaping have helped position our company for a continuation of the comprehensively strong results that Brown-Forman has historically enjoyed. Today’s announcement is reflective of the breadth and balance of stakeholder value we strive to create over time.\"\nThe stock split will be effected in the form of a dividend on both Class A and Class B common stock, payable in shares of Class B common stock. For every four shares of either Class A or Class B common stock held, shareholders of record as of the close of business on February 7, 2018 will receive one share of Class B common stock, with any fractional shares payable in cash. The additional shares and cash for fractional shares will be distributed to stockholders on February 28, 2018. Any future cash dividend declared will reflect the greater number of shares outstanding after. In addition, all per-share amounts in the company's subsequent financial statements will reflect the stock split.\nThis will be the 14 th stock split since the company’s listing in 1934. Assuming there had been no splits over that time period, one share of Class B common stock would be worth approximately $189,000 today.\nThe company also declared a special dividend of $1.00 on its Class A and Class B common stock, which will be paid to stockholders of record on April 2, 2018 and they will receive the cash dividend on April 23, 2018. This equates to roughly $480 million after the implementation of the stock split.\nThe company has also decided to fully fund its current pension liability of $120 million, further strengthening an important employee retirement benefit. Additionally, with the goal of helping to fund the company’s ongoing philanthropic endeavors in the communities where Brown-Forman employees live and work, the company is pursuing the creation of a foundation with a contribution of $60-$70 million. The company anticipates that the foundation’s proceeds will provide a consistent amount of revenue per year for its charitable giving program independent of the company’s yearly earnings.\nBrown-Forman’s Board of Directors also declared a regular quarterly cash dividend of 15 4/5 cents per share on its Class A and Class B common stock, reflective of the planned five for four stock split. Stockholders of record on March 5, 2018 will receive the cash dividend on April 2, 2018.\nReferencing the impact of tax reform, Varga added, “As is customary for Brown-Forman, we will provide an updated perspective on fiscal year 2018 with the release of third quarter results in early March, and this update will incorporate the estimated impact of tax reform on an ongoing basis.”\nFor almost 150 years, Brown-Forman Corporation has enriched the experience of life by responsibly building fine quality beverage alcohol brands, including Jack Daniel’s Tennessee Whiskey, Jack Daniel’s & Cola, Jack Daniel’s Tennessee Honey, Jack Daniel’s Tennessee Fire, Gentleman Jack, Jack Daniel’s Single Barrel, Finlandia, Korbel, el Jimador, Woodford Reserve, Old Forester, Canadian Mist, Herradura, New Mix, Sonoma-Cutrer, Early Times, Chambord, BenRiach, GlenDronach and Slane.
