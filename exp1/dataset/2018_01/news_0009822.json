I did six weeks of preparation. It was great. Very good,” said Giorgi, who missed the back end of last season with an elbow injury. \n“I made a few errors at the start but then I played my game and it was good after that.” \nGiorgi will next meet twice Wimbledon champion Petra Kvitova, who went through when last year’s surprise Australian Open semi-finalist Mirjana Lucic-Baroni retired after losing the first set 6-1. \nAnother former grand slam champion also progressed with Germany’s 2016 Melbourne Park title winner Angelique Kerber saving two match points to outlast Lucie Safarova 6-7(3) 7-6 (8) 6-2. \nKerber’s victory sends her into a second round clash with multiple grand slam champion Venus Williams. \nSlovakian dynamo Dominika Cibulkova also reached the last 16 with a quickfire 6-3 6-1 demolition of eighth seeded Latvian Anastasija Sevastova. \nSydney’s weather continued to wreak havoc with Sunday’s extreme heat replaced by storms with hail, lightning and rain all halting the Kerber-Safarova clash. \nThe Australian Open, the opening grand slam of the year, runs from Jan. 15-28.
