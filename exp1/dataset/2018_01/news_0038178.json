REUTERS/Dado Ruvic/Illustration Some Western firms have been advised by lawyers that the U.S. Treasury Department could, in theory, take the view this constituted financing in violation of the sanctions, according to several people involved in the discussions.\nTwo Microsoft distributors, Merlion and RRC, set out new guidelines for sales in directives referring to restrictions resulting from the new U.S. sanctions policy.\n“Microsoft will lose a market worth several billion dollars, from the point of view of its corporate and government clients in our country,” Nikoforov is cited by the TASS news agency as saying at the annual economic summit in Davos, Switzerland.\nRussia is able to get by without Microsoft and can replace the software completely, Nikoforov said.\n“This may require further work and investments, but... it’s the U.S. economy that is hit hardest by these politically-motivated sanctions,” Nikoforov said, according to TASS.\nNeither Merlion nor RRC responded to Reuters questions.\nMicrosoft said in a statement to Reuters: “Microsoft has a strong commitment to complying with legal requirements and has robust processes around the world to help ensure that our partners are in compliance as well.”\nReporting by Anastasia Lyrchikova; Writing by Polina Ivanova; Editing by\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-23T14:44:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-23T15:10:24.025+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
