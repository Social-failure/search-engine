Italy’s budget deficit came in at 2.5 percent of gross domestic product in 2016 and was below that level last year, according to Italy’s central bank.\n“The 3 percent deficit rule can be a debatable one, but we intend on respecting it,” Berlusconi told reporters in Brussels.\nOpinion polls show the centre-right grouping involving Berlusconi is in the lead ahead of an election on March 4.
