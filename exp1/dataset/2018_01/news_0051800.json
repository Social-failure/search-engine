On Monday, Petrobras also settled taxes owed for vessel leasing contracts totaling $538.5 million, according to Reuters.\nSpeaking to CNBC at a conference in Florence, Italy, on Monday, Nelson Silva, executive director at Petrobras, said that there would be dividends \"as soon as we have profits.\"\n\"We are working hard to get to that place,\" he added.\nSilva told CNBC the company has made \"much, much progress\" in changing its governance and culture.\nBrazil is holding a general election in October of this year â€” that could potentially have an impact on the company. However, Silva shrugged off any concerns about the country's next leadership, arguing Petrobras is focused on its business plan.\n\"For us there's only once scenario, which is the business plan we have to deliver, so we are focused totally in the business plan and do not pay attention to any distraction outside of the company,\" he said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-30T11:15:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-30T11:15:10.023+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
