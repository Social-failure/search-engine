Beyond that area, Ocean Infinity will receive $70 million, Liow said.\nIts priority is to locate the wreckage or the flight and cockpit recorders, and present credible evidence to confirm their location within 90 days, Liow added.\n“They cannot take forever or drag it on for another six months or a year.”\nFILE PHOTO - A woman leaves a message of support and hope for the passengers of the missing Malaysia Airlines MH370 in central Kuala Lumpur March 16, 2014. REUTERS/Damir Sagolj/File Photo ‘UNIQUE SOLUTION’\nOcean Infinity’s vessel carries eight autonomous underwater vehicles that will scour the seabed with scanning equipment for information to be sent back for analysis.\nIt has 65 crew, including two government representatives drawn from the Malaysian navy.\nThe ship could complete the search within three or four weeks, and cover up to 60,000 square km in 90 days, or four times faster than earlier efforts, Plunkett told Reuters.\n“It was a unique problem that required a unique solution... We looked at it and said, ‘Let’s do something different than what other people would do,’ and that’s the essence of our business.”\nOcean Infinity’s core business is in the oil and gas industry, as well as subsea exploration services for tasks such as underwater cabling and seabed mapping, he said.\nThe company’s shareholders would bear the upfront costs of the search, Plunkett added.\nDebris from MH370 could provide clues to events on board before the crash. There have been competing theories that the aircraft suffered mechanical failure or was intentionally flown off course.\nInvestigators believe someone may have deliberately switched off the plane’s transponder before diverting it thousands of miles out over the Indian Ocean.\nAt least three pieces of debris collected from sites on Indian Ocean islands and along Africa’s east coast have been confirmed as being from the missing plane.\nReporting by Rozanna Latiff; Writing by Praveen Menon; Editing by Jamie Freed and Clarence Fernandez\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-10T11:59:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-10T12:37:51.025+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
