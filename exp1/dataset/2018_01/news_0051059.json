In 2014, it paid $8.3 billion to buy travel and expense management software firm Concur, marking the company’s largest acquisition ever.\n“We are in no way looking to be in the M&A business at scale,” the SAP CEO said. “This is a tuck-in.”\nCallidus, which is based outside of San Francisco, competes with software giants Oracle and IBM ( IBM.N ), as well as more focused start-ups Anaplan, Optymyze and Xactly.\nThe deal is expected to be essentially neutral to SAP’s reported earnings per share this year, and should begin to boost earnings starting in 2019, SAP said.\nSAP has agreed to pay $36 per share for Callidus, which is a premium of about 10 percent to the stock’s last close of $32.70 but nearly 30 percent higher based on the company’s share performance over the last 90 days.\nThe deal was unanimously agreed by Callidus’s board, the two companies said in a joint statement.\nReporting by Eric Auchard in Walldorf, Germany and Shubham Kalia and Subrat Patnaik in Bengaluru; Editing by Sunil Nair and Keith Weir\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-30T11:49:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-30T12:11:31.001+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
