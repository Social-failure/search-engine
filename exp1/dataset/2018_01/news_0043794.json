State Bank of India shares were down 2.7 percent, Punjab National Bank was down 3.5 percent while Bank of Baroda was down 3.6 percent. \nSmaller banks however gained. UCO Bank was up 5.7 percent, United Bank of India rose 1.4 percent and Indian Overseas Bank was up 1.7 percent. \n($1 = 63.5300 rupees)", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-25T07:39:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-25T08:01:24.011+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
