She has proved that she can step up to anyone, she is very smart and clear on what needs to be done... Those two together could actually make a dream couple.\" \nGermany has been without a government since September's general election; however, a coalition between the Social Democratic Party (SPD) and Merkel's Christian Democratic Union (CDU) is in the making. The CDU received the most votes and Merkel is expected to lead the new government. \n\"She can support the momentum into the future going forward with Macron and she has enough experience to help him not to jump too quickly to things,\" Kaeser said. \nKaeser, the head of the German multinational, said that that once a government is in place in Germany, this will be \"good for Europe.\" Silvia Amaro Digital Reporter, CNBC.com Playing ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-24T14:47:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-24T15:58:45.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
