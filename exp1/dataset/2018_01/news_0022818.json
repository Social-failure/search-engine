Government regulators allowed the company to partially restart the mine in August.\nSince then, the mine has operated at a significantly lower efficiency compared with industry benchmark levels. In December, South32 forecast its Illawarra coal project’s 2018 output at about 60 percent of what it produced the previous year.\nThe company, which resumed operations at a section of the colliery in October, said it remained committed to its ramp-up plan as it looked to drive productivity to an ”acceptable level”.\nDecember quarter manganese ore output rose 21.8 percent from a year ago. Zinc production was down 62.3 percent over the period, while nickel output increased 12.2 percent.\nSouth32 raised its full-year output forecast for its South African Manganese operations by 8 percent due to strong market demand and a record December quarter performance, but stood pat on guidance for all other operations.
