The aim is to apply lessons from the financial crisis when Lehman Brothers collapsed but it took time to find out who was exposed to the bank’s derivatives trades.\nESMA reviewed fees charged by the TRs and in its report published on Thursday said it was unclear whether they comply with EU rules that cost must be the key pricing factor.\n“It is important to ensure that TRs’ decisions on price setting are based not only on strategic and/or practical considerations,” the report said.\n“ESMA expects that TRs are able to demonstrate that their fees, including fee caps, are driven by costs.” (Reporting by Huw Jones, editing by Carolyn Cohn)\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-01-11T20:35:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-12T18:28:33.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
