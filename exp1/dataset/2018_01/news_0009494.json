Absolutely not,” she told the conference. \n“We have to understand that the number of players in the banking system is not the only consideration,” she said. \nUnder the share-swap deal, Mizrahi-Tefahot will buy the 75 percent held by Union’s controlling shareholders, including Yeshayahu Landau and Shlomo Eliyahu Holdings. It will then seek to buy the remaining 25 percent through an offer to the public. $1 = 3.4285 shekels Reporting by Steven Scheer and Ari Rabinovitch; Editing by Edmund Blair", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-10T14:07:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-10T14:30:58.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
