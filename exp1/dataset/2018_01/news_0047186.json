It said the move was also to \"prevent the buildup of risks that could arise from interest rates being too low for a prolonged period of time.\" \nThe central bank last hiked the interest rate in July 2014. In July 2016, it cut the rate to 3 percent shortly after Britain's Brexit vote. \nThe government predicts 5.5 percent growth in the economy this year, with the ringgit currency strengthening. \nBank Negara said in a statement that inflation hit 3.7 percent last year but is expected to be lower this year. \nThe rate hike surprised some analysts who had expected any increase to come after the general elections, which must be held by August but are widely expected to be called in the second quarter of the year. Analysts said another rate hike would be expected after the elections to realign with higher U.S. and regional interest rates.
