If it’s about a knee-jerk reaction to illustrate value, I think they are more patient than that,” Sidhu said.\nThe company still has funds to deploy from the $700 million raised through a private placement by Axiata to Malaysian sovereign wealth fund Khazanah Nasional Bhd, local pension fund Retirement Fund Inc and Innovation Network Corporation of Japan.\nOf that, $270 million and $160 million were used for acquisitions in Pakistan and Myanmar.
