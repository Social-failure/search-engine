Starz said Altice “unilaterally pulled down the Starz signal,” without providing any notice, in the midst of active negotiations. \nAltice spokeswoman Lisa Anselmo said the contents of the Starz letter “are completely false and without merit.” \nThe pay TV distributor announced on Monday it would no longer carry Starz’ channels to its 3.4 million Optimum and SuddenLink TV customers, after the two failed to reach an agreement on pricing. \nAltice has advised customers to sign up for the premium cable network’s $8.99 online video service if they want to continue watching its programming.
