I will let you know how it feels to be beaten up until all your teeth drop to the ground.” \n“It is absurd how a protest against a university policy has now been elevated to the level of state secession and I‘m being labelled a Hong Kong independence advocate,” Chan told Reuters.

Slideshow (3 Images) \nBaptist University said in a statement on Friday the decision to suspend the two “was made solely based on the abusive behaviour of the students, nothing to do with politics and outside pressure”. \nA recent report published by non-government organisation Hong Kong Watch said while academic freedom is “alive and generally well” in Hong Kong, it is under threat due to the politicization of universities following the 2014 protests. \n“The suspensions that these students are facing are symptomatic of the broader politicization of universities,” said the report’s author, Kevin Carrico, a lecturer of Chinese Studies at Macquarie University. \nHe also called the students “victims of a state-led campaign” in reference to the Global Times articles. \nFootage of the students and teachers arguing during the eight-hour sit-in protest last Wednesday was circulated widely online and picked up by local and mainland Chinese media. \nSome, including the city’s acting Chief Executive Matthew Cheung, have criticised student union leader Lau Tsz-kei, 20, for using an expletive when he argued with a teacher. Lau later apologized. \nA commentary published under a subsidiary of the state-owned People’s Daily on Thursday said the Baptist University students had been “heavily poisoned by an attitude that fights against everything mainland China”.
