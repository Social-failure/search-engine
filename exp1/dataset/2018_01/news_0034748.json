His daughter Colombina and grandson, also called Angel, both had some success with rock bands in Latin America in the 1990s.\nNicanor Parra’s first published book of poems was “Cancionero Sin Nombre” (Songbook Without a Name), released in 1937 while he was a student in the capital Santiago. In it, Parra broke with the florid style prevalent in Latin American literature at the time, and adopted a more direct, colloquial style.\nPolice stand guard at the house of Chilean poet Nicanor Parra, a mathematician and physicist, awarded with the Spanish Ministry of Culture's Cervantes Prize, the most important prize of Spanish literature, after he died at the age of 103, in Santiago, Chile, January 23, 2018. REUTERS/Ivan Alvarado After graduating in physics, he taught in Chilean schools before moving to the United States where he studied at Brown University in Rhode Island.\nHe returned to Chile in 1946 and divided much of the rest of his life between teaching theoretical physics and writing and reading his poetry.\nHis many published works include “Thick Works” (1969), “Artifacts” (1972), “Leaves of Parra” (1985), “After-Dinner Declarations” (2006) and a translation of Shakespeare’s “King Lear” (2004).\nIn 1999 he wrote the following message to young poets:\n”Write as you will, In whatever style you like, Too much blood has run under the bridge, To go on believing, That only one road is right.\n”In poetry everything is permitted.\n“With only this condition of course, You have to improve the blank page.”\nHe lived the last years of his life in a coastal town southwest of Santiago.\nWriting by Rosalba O'Brien and Dave Sherwood; Editing by Lisa Shumaker\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-23T21:39:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-23T22:05:45.002+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
