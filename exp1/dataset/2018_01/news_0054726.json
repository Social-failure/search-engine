But Philadelphia went 0-for-15 from deep in the opening half while Antetokounmpo and Khris Middleton combined for 26 to send Milwaukee into the break with a 55-53 lead.\nBack-to-back 3-pointers from Tony Snell and Middleton put the Bucks ahead by eight with 3:54 left in the third. Antetokounmpo had a chance to make it a 10-point lead but lost the ball and James Young knocked down Philadelphia’s first 3-pointer with 3:15 left, bringing the Sixers within five.\nThe Bucks hit 4 of 7 3-point attempts in the quarter and went into the fourth with an 83-75 lead.\nA Middleton jumper early in the final quarter gave Milwaukee a 10-point cushion and after Robert Covington came up empty on the other end, Sterling Brown connected on a 27-footer from the right wing to put the Bucks up 88-75 with 10:25 to play.\nThey wouldn’t score again, though, until a Dellavedova 3 with 6:50 to go. He followed that with a steal, went the length of the court, drew contact from Covington then hit both free throws to put the Bucks back up 12.\n-- Field Level Media\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-01-30T11:49:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-30T18:55:49.008+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
