The retailer also opened three new cash-and-carry stores, all in different regions.\n$1 = 3.22 reais Reporting by Gram Slattery; Editing by Susan Thomas and Lisa Shumaker\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-01-17T05:38:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-17T20:07:09.006+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
