It may also consider a transaction with its majority-owned VMware Inc, a public virtualization software maker.\nVMware shares, which have gained more than 62 percent in the past 12 months, touched an all-time high on Thursday. As part of Dell’s takeover of EMC in 2016, shareholders received VMware tracking stock, a move intended to give investors exposure to VMware, which is growing faster than EMC.\nDell and VMware were not immediately available for comment outside regular U.S. business hours. The news was first reported by Bloomberg.\nAdditional reporting by Ismail Shakil in Bengaluru; Editing by Amrutha Gayathri and Jacqueline Wong\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-26T05:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-26T06:00:42.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
