REUTERS/Kim Kyung-Hoon/File Photo Deason asked the company’s board in a letter dated Jan. 17 to hire new and independent advisers to evaluate the photocopier company’s strategic options with Fuji.\nDeason said the options “including the potential termination of what I suspect but am unable to yet confirm is a one-sided value destroying agreement disfavoring Xerox.”\nThe third-largest shareholder of Xerox said he had written to the board over eight months ago on the copier maker’s relationship with Fuji and requested relevant documents but Xerox failed to provide them.\nThe Wall Street Journal reported last week that Xerox, under pressure to find new growth sources amid shrinking demand for its printer and copier business, was in talks on a deal with the Japanese camera maker that could include a change in control of Xerox.\nNorwalk, Connecticut-based Xerox has also been targeted by activist investor Carl Icahn, its biggest shareholder, who said last month that the company “desperately” needed new leadership as it was slow to launch new products and increase revenue.\nReporting by Sonam Rai in Bengaluru and Pushkala Aripaka and additional repoting by Sangameswaran S; Editing by Maju Samuel and Lisa Shumaker\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-18T05:14:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-18T05:29:53.006+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
