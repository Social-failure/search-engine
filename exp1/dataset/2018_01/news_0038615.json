Excluding special charges and income tax adjustments, UAL reported fourth-quarter net income of $408 million, diluted earnings per share of $1.40, pre-tax earnings of $631 million and pre-tax margin of 6.7 percent. UAL reported full-year net income of $2.1 billion, diluted earnings per share of $7.02, pre-tax earnings of $3.0 billion and pre-tax margin of 7.9 percent. Excluding special charges and income tax adjustments, UAL reported full-year net income of $2.1 billion, diluted earnings per share of $6.76, pre-tax earnings of $3.2 billion and pre-tax margin of 8.4 percent. UAL repurchased $553 million of its common shares in the fourth quarter, bringing the full-year share repurchases to $1.8 billion and completing the company's July 2016 $2 billion share repurchase program. The company's board of directors authorized a new $3 billion share repurchase program in December. During 2017, United consistently notched operational bests in on-time arrivals and completions while seeing the fewest cancellations and the best baggage performance in company history. Employees earned $349 million in profit sharing for 2017.\n\"I am incredibly proud of how our employees delivered in 2017, achieving our best-ever operational performance. Reliability is an important pillar in our continued focus on further improving the customer experience,\" said Oscar Munoz, chief executive officer of United Airlines. \"Looking ahead, we are committed to improving profitability over the long-term by building on the strong foundation we have laid over the past two years. Everyone at United is excited to enter 2018 with a clear set of priorities and a renewed sense of purpose around unlocking the full potential of United Airlines.\"\nFourth-Quarter and Full-Year Revenue\nFor the fourth quarter of 2017, revenue was $9.4 billion, an increase of 4.3 percent year-over-year. Fourth-quarter 2017 consolidated passenger revenue per available seat mile (PRASM) was up 0.2 percent compared to the fourth quarter of 2016. Cargo revenue was $304 million in the fourth quarter of 2017, an increase of 21.6 percent year-over-year primarily due to higher international freight volume and yields. For the full year of 2017, total revenue was $37.7 billion, an increase of 3.2 percent year-over-year.\n\"Everything we do at United is underpinned by a commitment to deliver top tier operational reliability,\" said Scott Kirby, president of United Airlines. \"Thanks to the drive and dedication of our employees, we have significantly raised the bar in this area, delivering a record-setting operational performance in 2017. Looking ahead, our focus will be on continuing to improve customer service and expanding United's network to offer customers more choice.\"\nFourth-Quarter and Full-Year Costs\nTotal operating expense was $8.7 billion in the fourth quarter, up 8.2 percent year-over-year. Consolidated unit cost per available seat mile (CASM) increased 4.0 percent compared to the fourth quarter of 2016 due largely to higher fuel and labor expense. Fourth-quarter consolidated CASM, excluding special charges, third-party business expenses, fuel and profit sharing, increased 1.5 percent year-over-year, driven mainly by higher labor expense. For the full year, consolidated CASM increased 2.8 percent compared to full-year 2016 due largely to higher fuel and labor expense. Excluding special charges, third-party business expenses, fuel and profit sharing, consolidated CASM increased 3.1 percent compared to the prior year primarily due to expenses resulting from labor agreements ratified in 2016.\n\"We are encouraged by our financial results in the fourth quarter which capped a year of strong earnings. Additionally, throughout the year we made significant investments in the business while continuing to return cash to our shareholders through $1.8 billion of share repurchases,\" said Andrew Levy, executive vice president and chief financial officer of United Airlines. \"In 2018, we will continue to focus on cost control, invest strategically into the business and utilize our new $3 billion share repurchase authorization to return cash to our shareholders.\"\nCapital Allocation\nUAL generated $728 million in operating cash flow during the fourth quarter of 2017 and ended the quarter with $5.8 billion in unrestricted liquidity, including $2.0 billion of undrawn commitments under its revolving credit facility. UAL generated $3.4 billion in operating cash flow for the full year. The company continued to invest in its business through capital expenditures of $1.1 billion in the fourth quarter and a total of $4.0 billion for the full year.

Retired the company's iconic Boeing 747 fleet with a final farewell flight between San Francisco and Honolulu.\nCustomer Experience\nTook several actions to improve the overall customer experience – including providing more tools to employees to assist customers and increasing compensation for denied boarding. Rolled out system-wide new Customer Solutions Desk with a dedicated team to develop creative solutions to assist customers in reaching their final destinations when their travel plans don't go as expected.

The effective cash tax rate is calculated by dividing cash taxes paid by pre-tax income excluding special charges. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2017, the effective cash tax rate was 0.6%.\n(b)\nThe purpose of this adjustment is to capitalize the impact of aircraft operating leases. The company uses a multiple of seven times its annual aircraft rent expense to estimate the potential capitalized value and related liability of its aircraft. This is a simplified method used by many rating agencies and financial analysts to assist with the impact of operating leases on financial measures like return on invested capital.\n(c)\nNon-interest bearing liabilities include advance ticket sales, frequent flyer deferred revenue, deferred income taxes and other non-interest bearing liabilities.\nUNITED CONTINENTAL HOLDINGS, INC.\nNON-GAAP FINANCIAL RECONCILIATION\n(A) UAL evaluates its financial performance utilizing various accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP) and Non-GAAP financial measures, including operating income (loss) excluding special charges, income (loss) before income taxes excluding special charges and reflecting hedge adjustments, net income (loss) excluding special charges and reflecting hedge adjustments, net earnings (loss) per share excluding special charges and reflecting hedge adjustments, and CASM, as adjusted, among others.\nCASM is a common metric used in the airline industry to measure an airline's cost structure and efficiency. UAL reports CASM excluding special charges, third-party business expenses, fuel and profit sharing. UAL believes that adjusting for special charges is useful to investors because special charges are non-recurring charges not indicative of UAL's ongoing performance. UAL also believes that excluding third-party business expenses, such as maintenance, ground handling and catering services for third parties, fuel sales and non-air mileage redemptions, provides more meaningful disclosure because these expenses are not directly related to UAL's core business. UAL also believes that excluding fuel costs from certain measures is useful to investors because it provides an additional measure of management's performance excluding the effects of a significant cost item over which management has limited influence. UAL excludes profit sharing because this exclusion allows investors to better understand and analyze our recurring cost performance and provides a more meaningful comparison of our core operating costs to the airline industry. In addition, the company believes that adjusting for prior period gains and losses on fuel derivative contracts settled in the current period is useful because the adjustments allow investors to better understand the cash impact of settled fuel derivative contracts in a given period.\nPursuant to SEC Regulation G, UAL has included the following reconciliations of reported Non-GAAP financial measures to comparable financial measures reported on a GAAP basis.\nThree Months Ended\nDecember 31,\n%\nIncrease/\n(Decrease)\nYear Ended\nDecember 31,\n%\nIncrease/\n(Decrease)\n2017\n2016\n2017\n2016\nCASM Mainline Operations (cents)\nCost per available seat mile (CASM)\n12.90\n12.43\n3.8\n12.59\n12.22\n3.0\nSpecial charges (D)\n0.06\n(0.06)\nNM\n0.07\n0.29\nNM\nThird-party business expenses\n0.12\n0.13\n(7.7)\n0.12\n0.11\n9.1\nFuel expense\n2.68\n2.33\n15.0\n2.46\n2.16\n13.9\nCASM, excluding special charges, third-party business expenses and fuel\n10.04\n10.03\n0.1\n9.94\n9.66\n2.9\nProfit sharing per available seat mile\n0.08\n0.22\n(63.6)\n0.15\n0.28\n(46.4)\nCASM, excluding special charges, third-party business expenses, fuel, and profit sharing\n9.96\n9.81\n1.5\n9.79\n9.38\n4.4\nCASM Consolidated Operations (cents)\nCost per available seat mile (CASM)\n13.39\n12.87\n4.0\n13.05\n12.70\n2.8\nSpecial charges (D)\n0.04\n(0.05)\nNM\n0.07\n0.25\nNM\nThird-party business expenses\n0.12\n0.11\n9.1\n0.10\n0.10\n—\nFuel expense\n2.88\n2.49\n15.7\n2.64\n2.29\n15.3\nCASM, excluding special charges, third-party business expenses and fuel\n10.35\n10.32\n0.3\n10.24\n10.06\n1.8\nProfit sharing per available seat mile\n0.07\n0.19\n(63.2)\n0.13\n0.25\n(48.0)\nCASM, excluding special charges, third-party business expenses, fuel, and profit sharing\n10.28\n10.13\n1.5\n10.11\n9.81\n3.1\nUNITED CONTINENTAL HOLDINGS, INC.\nNON-GAAP FINANCIAL RECONCILIATION (Continued)\nThree Months Ended\nDecember 31,\n$\nIncrease/\n(Decrease)\n%\nIncrease/\n(Decrease)\nYear Ended\nDecember 31,\n$\nIncrease/\n(Decrease)\n%\nIncrease/\n(Decrease)\n(in millions)\n2017\n2016\n2017\n2016\nOperating expenses\n$\n8,709\n$\n8,047\n$\n662\n8.2\n$\n34,238\n$\n32,218\n$\n2,020\n6.3\nSpecial charges (D)\n31\n(31)\n62\nNM\n176\n638\n(462)\nNM\nOperating expenses, excluding special charges\n8,678\n8,078\n600\n7.4\n34,062\n31,580\n2,482\n7.9\nThird-party business expenses\n72\n69\n3\n4.3\n277\n257\n20\n7.8\nFuel expense\n1,875\n1,555\n320\n20.6\n6,913\n5,813\n1,100\n18.9\nProfit sharing, including taxes\n45\n122\n(77)\n(63.1)\n349\n628\n(279)\n(44.4)\nOperating expenses, excluding fuel, profit sharing, special charges and third-party business expenses\n$\n6,686\n$\n6,332\n$\n354\n5.6\n$\n26,523\n$\n24,882\n$\n1,641\n6.6\nOperating income\n$\n729\n$\n1,005\n$\n(276)\n(27.5)\n$\n3,498\n$\n4,338\n$\n(840)\n(19.4)\nSpecial charges (D)\n31\n(31)\n62\nNM\n176\n638\n(462)\nNM\nOperating income, excluding special charges\n$\n760\n$\n974\n$\n(214)\n(22.0)\n$\n3,674\n$\n4,976\n$\n(1,302)\n(26.2)\nIncome before income taxes\n$\n600\n$\n884\n$\n(284)\n(32.1)\n$\n2,999\n$\n3,819\n$\n(820)\n(21.5)\nSpecial charges and hedge adjustments before income taxes (D)\n31\n(27)\n58\nNM\n176\n643\n(467)\nNM\nIncome before income taxes excluding special charges and reflecting hedge adjustments\n$\n631\n$\n857\n$\n(226)\n(26.4)\n$\n3,175\n$\n4,462\n$\n(1,287)\n(28.8)\nNet income\n$\n580\n$\n397\n$\n183\n46.1\n$\n2,131\n$\n2,263\n$\n(132)\n(5.8)\nSpecial charges and hedge adjustments, net of tax and income tax adjustments (D)\n(172)\n165\n(337)\nNM\n(79)\n594\n(673)\nNM\nNet income, excluding special charges and reflecting hedge adjustments and income tax adjustments\n$\n408\n$\n562\n$\n(154)\n(27.4)\n$\n2,052\n$\n2,857\n$\n(805)\n(28.2)\nDiluted earnings per share\n$\n1.99\n$\n1.26\n$\n0.73\n57.9\n$\n7.02\n$\n6.85\n$\n0.17\n2.5\nSpecial charges and hedge adjustments\n0.11\n(0.09)\n0.20\nNM\n0.58\n1.95\n(1.37)\nNM\nIncome tax adjustments and tax effect related to special charges and hedge adjustments\n(0.70)\n0.61\n(1.31)\nNM\n(0.84)\n(0.15)\n(0.69)\nNM\nDiluted earnings per share, excluding special charges and income tax adjustments and reflecting hedge adjustments\n$\n1.40\n$\n1.78\n$\n(0.38)\n(21.3)\n$\n6.76\n$\n8.65\n$\n(1.89)\n(21.8)\nUNITED CONTINENTAL HOLDINGS, INC.\nNON-GAAP FINANCIAL RECONCILIATION (Continued)\nUAL provides financial metrics, including earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA), that we believe provide useful supplemental information for management and investors by measuring profit and profit as a percentage of total operating revenues.

In the first quarter of 2017, approximately 1,000 technicians and related employees elected to voluntarily separate from the company and will receive a severance payment, with a maximum value of $100,000 per participant, based on years of service, with retirement dates through early 2019. Also during the three months and year ended December 31, 2017, the company recorded $5 million ($3 million net of taxes) and $33 million ($21 million net of taxes), respectively, of severance primarily related to its management reorganization initiative.\nDuring the three months and year ended December 31, 2016, the company recorded $10 million ($6 million net of taxes) and $37 million ($24 million net of taxes), respectively, of severance and benefit costs related to a voluntary early-out program for the company's flight attendants and other severance agreements.\nImpairment of assets: In the fourth quarter of 2017, the company recorded a $10 million ($6 million net of taxes) impairment charge related to obsolete spare parts inventory. During 2017, United recorded a $15 million ($10 million net of taxes) intangible asset impairment charge related to a maintenance service agreement.\nIn April 2016, the Federal Aviation Administration (\"FAA\") announced that, effective October 30, 2016, it would designate Newark Liberty International Airport (\"Newark\") as a Level 2 schedule-facilitated airport under the International Air Transport Association Worldwide Slot Guidelines. The designation was associated with an updated demand and capacity analysis of Newark by the FAA. In the second quarter of 2016, the company determined that the FAA's action impaired the entire value of its Newark slots because the slots are no longer the mechanism that governs take-off and landing rights. Accordingly, the company recorded a $412 million special charge ($264 million net of taxes) to write off the intangible asset.\nLabor agreement costs and related items: In 2016, the fleet service, passenger service, storekeeper and other employees represented by the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers (IAM) ratified seven new contracts with the company which extended the contracts through 2021. Also in 2016, the technicians and related employees represented by the International Brotherhood of Teamsters (IBT) ratified a six-year joint collective bargaining agreement which extended the contract through 2022. During 2016, the company recorded $171 million ($110 million net of taxes) of special charges primarily for payments in conjunction with the IAM and IBT agreements described above. As part of the ratified contract with the IBT, the company amended some of its technicians and related employees' postretirement medical plans. The amendments triggered curtailment accounting, resulting in the recognition of a one-time $60 million gain ($38 million net of taxes) for accelerated recognition of a prior service credit in one of the plans. Also, as part of the ratified contract with the Association of Flight Attendants, the company amended two of its flight attendant postretirement medical plans. The amendments triggered curtailment accounting, resulting in the recognition of a one-time $47 million gain ($30 million net of taxes) for accelerated recognition of a prior service credit.\nCleveland airport lease restructuring: During 2016, the City of Cleveland agreed to amend the company's lease, which runs through 2029, associated with certain excess airport terminal space (principally Terminal D) and related facilities at Hopkins International Airport. The company recorded an accrual for remaining payments under the lease for facilities that the company no longer uses and will continue to incur costs under the lease without economic benefit to the company. This liability was measured and recorded at its fair value when the company ceased its right to use such facilities leased to it pursuant to the lease. The company recorded a special charge of $74 million ($47 million net of taxes) related to the amended lease.\nHedge adjustments: Prior to 2017, the company used certain combinations of derivative contracts that were economic hedges but did not qualify for hedge accounting under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. As with derivatives that qualified for hedge accounting, the economic hedges and individual contracts were part of the company's program to mitigate the adverse financial impact of potential increases in the price of fuel. The company recorded changes in the fair value of the various contracts that were not designated for hedge accounting to Nonoperating income (expense): Miscellaneous, net in the statements of consolidated operations. During the three months and year ended December 31, 2016, for fuel derivative contracts that settled in the three months and year ended December 31, 2016, the company recorded mark-to-market gains of $4 million and $6 million, respectively, in prior periods.\n(E) Effective tax rate: The company's effective tax rate for the three months and year ended December 31, 2017 was 3.5% and 29.0%, respectively. The company's effective tax rate for the three months and year ended December 31, 2016 was 55.1% and 40.7%, respectively. The rate for both 2017 periods was impacted by a one-time, $192 million benefit due to the passage of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act in the fourth quarter of 2017. The rate for both 2016 periods was impacted by a special tax expense of $180 million. In 2016, the company recorded approximately $180 million of deferred income tax expense adjustments in AOCI, which related to losses on fuel hedges designated for hedge accounting. Accounting rules required the adjustments to remain in AOCI as long as the company had fuel derivatives designated for cash flow hedge accounting. In 2016, we settled all of our fuel hedges and have not entered into any new fuel derivative contracts for hedge accounting. Accordingly, the company reclassified the $180 million to income tax expense in 2016.\nThe effective tax rates for the 2017 and 2016 periods represented a blend of federal, state and foreign taxes and the impact of certain nondeductible items. The effective tax rate for the three months and year ended December 31, 2017 reflects the impact of a change in the mix of domestic and foreign earnings.\nView original content with multimedia: http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/united-airlines-reports-fourth-quarter-and-full-year-2017-performance-300586900.html\nSOURCE United Airlines", "external_links": ["http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/united-airlines-reports-fourth-quarter-and-full-year-2017-performance-300586900.html"], "published": "2018-01-24T00:05:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-24T00:55:28.017+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
