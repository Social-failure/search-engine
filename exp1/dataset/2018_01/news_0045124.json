If I win one more point, I make history in Korea,” he told reporters. \n“Something I (was) thinking like that. I have to think about the ceremony. Anyway, I had to stay calm because... the match was not finished yet.” \nChung’s raw power ultimately prevailed, a blazing forehand into the corner causing a scrambling Sandgren to push his desperate retrieve well past the baseline. \nChung flashed a broad grin as South Koreans draped in flags roared in the terraces and his mother shaped a love heart with her arms from the players’ box. \nSouth Korea has been late to the party in global tennis but Chung’s success could light a fire for the sport in the east Asian nation. \nIt has also been a devastating raid by a player barely spoken about before the tournament, with most of the buzz around young guns like Germany’s Alexander Zverev, who Chung dismantled in the third round, and Australian Nick Kyrgios.

Chung Hyeon of South Korea hits a shot against Tennys Sandgren of the U.S. REUTERS/Toru Hanai FALSE ALARM \nThe match began in an unnerving way for all concerned, a false alarm ringing out and warning to “evacuate, evacuate, evacuate” early in the first set. \nPlay was halted for a few moments and some fans scurried for the exits. \nChung broke Sandgren in the third game and served out the set to love, then took the heavy-legged American’s serve again to take a 2-0 lead in the second. Slideshow (5 Images) \nSandgren rallied strongly, breaking Chung twice but he faltered when serving for the set at 5-3. \nThe Korean converted a second break point to get back on serve and the pair fought furiously in a breathless tiebreak. \nSandgren wound his forehand up for a straightforward winner to secure two set points but instead thumped the ball into the net to allow Chung to level at 5-5. \nAnother rush of blood saw the American fire long, and a clinical Chung needed only one chance to take the set.
