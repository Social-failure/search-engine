REUTERS/Joachim Dagenborg The decision, although expected, disappointed energy firms hoping to raise output from western Europe’s largest producer of oil and gas.\n“The potential for future value creation and jobs in these regions is large,” lobby group Norwegian Oil and Gas said in a statement.\nNegotiations with the Liberals have taken place since Jan. 2, following the government’s re-election last September, in which Solberg campaigned on a promise to continue to cut taxes for companies and individuals.\n“Parts of the oil policy, immigration and taxation were all difficult to agree,” the prime minister told a news conference on Sunday.\nNorway’s opposition Labour Party meanwhile criticized the government for not making firmer promises to raise military spending.\n“The government shows no ambition to meet NATO’s target of spending 2 percent (of GDP) by 2024,” Labour MP Anniken Huitfeldt tweeted.\nWriting by Terje Solsvik, editing by David Evans\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-14T19:22:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-14T19:48:38.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
