So you needed to take advantage of it today. Thankfully I was able to do that.” \nSpaniard Miguel Angel Jimenez, South African duo Darren Fichardt and Haydn Porteous, Irishman Paul Dunne and China’s Li Haotong were six under, a shot clear of a group containing defending champion Sergio Garcia. \nEnglishman Danny Willett endured a difficult opening day as he dropped three shots on the eighth and another four on the ninth to finish five-over at the bottom of the leaderboard.
