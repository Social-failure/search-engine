We are fully supportive of TfL’s efforts to enhance the standard of regulation in the private hire industry.”\nBoth TfL and Uber declined to comment.\nReporting by Costas Pitas; editing by Stephen Addison\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-12T16:47:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-12T17:03:47.001+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
