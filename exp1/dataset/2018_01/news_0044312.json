Wentworth Company® (“J.G. Wentworth” or the “Company”) today announced it has successfully completed its reorganization in coordination with its lenders (“Lenders”), pursuant to the Company’s Joint Prepackaged Chapter 11 Plan of Reorganization that was confirmed by the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware on January 17, 2018 (“the Plan”). The Company continued operations without interruption throughout the brief, in-court restructuring process.\nThrough its Plan, the Company fully extinguished $449.5 million in principal of outstanding debt, while securing a new revolving credit facility of approximately $70 million, supplied by HPS Investment Partners, LLC. The Company estimates that its debt service will be reduced from $32 million to approximately $5 million annually, and that its net leverage will be reduced from approximately 12.4x to 1.0x as a result of the reorganization. By deleveraging its balance sheet, the Company has emerged from the restructuring process with enhanced financial flexibility and the ability to accelerate its long-term growth initiatives.\n“Today, we have reached the final milestone in the restructuring process,” said Stewart A. Stockdale, Chief Executive Officer. “The Company has emerged stronger and more financially secure, allowing us flexibility to execute our business goals, focusing on growth and expansion, and to continue serving our customers’ needs.”\nThe efficient completion of the reorganization process reflects the Company’s alignment with its Lenders. Lenders have exchanged their claims under the Company’s extinguished credit facility for cash consideration and at least 95.5 percent of the equity in the newly-restructured Company.\nThroughout the reorganization process the Company has remained steadfast in delivering business results. J.G. Wentworth Home Lending, LLC has demonstrated record growth in loan originations and is increasing operational capacity through various technology and process improvements.
