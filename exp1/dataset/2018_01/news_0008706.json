The benchmark Bovespa stock index was nearly flat following a seven-day string of gains. Blue chips, such as miner Vale SA and state-controlled oil company Petr칩leo Brasileiro SA, led the gains. The rally in Brazilian stocks has been supported by investor bets on a market-friendly winner to this year's presidential elections who would advance President Michel Temer's austerity platform. Former President Luiz In치cio Lula da Silva, who has railed against Temer's policies, is leading opinion polls, but he could be barred from running if his conviction for corruption is upheld by a higher court on Jan. 24. Signs that the economic recovery is picking up steam have also supported demand for Brazilian stocks, which are bound to see earnings growth as Latin America's largest economy regains solid footing. \"Inflows from foreign investors remain substantial and the pipeline looks strong,\" analysts at the Magliano brokerage wrote in a report. The Brazilian real was also flat, roughly in line with major Latin American currencies, after strengthening 2.6 percent so far this year. The Mexican peso was down 0.2 percent, while the Chilean peso rose 0.1 percent. Traders in emerging markets have been closely following U.S. economic indicators and remarks by U.S. policymakers for hints over the pace of interest rate hikes there, particularly after a mixed jobs report last week. San Francisco Fed President John Williams told Reuters that the U.S. central bank should hike rates three times this year given that the already strong economy will get a boost from tax cuts. Higher U.S. rates could dampen demand for emerging markets, which offer higher yields.
