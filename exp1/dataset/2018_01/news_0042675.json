The United States this month also suspended military assistance worth about $2 billion. \nIslamabad denies sheltering militants and accuses Washington of not respecting Pakistan’s vast sacrifices in the war on militancy. \nOver the past decade, almost all U.S. drone strikes inside Pakistan have taken place within FATA, but some Pakistani officials fear the United States under Trump will begin carrying out strikes outside the tribal areas.
