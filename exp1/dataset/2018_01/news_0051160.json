Fourth quarter and annual earnings were reduced by $1.5 million due to the impact of an increase in income tax expense for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2017 as the Bank revalued its deferred tax assets to align with the lowered U.S. corporate tax rate.\nPresident and CEO, David V. Heald commented, \"We had an exceptional year with continued strong earnings and loan demand. While our earnings for the quarter and year reflect a substantial one-time downward revaluation of our deferred tax assets resulting from the recent reduction of the U.S. corporate tax rate, our pretax and after tax income for the year set another earnings record. We enter 2018 with a solid economy, a favorable corporate tax rate, and excitement in anticipation of opening our new headquarters in downtown Santa Cruz later in the year.\"\nSelected financial information is presented in the following table:\nYear Ended December 31,\n2017\n2016\nChange\nBalance Sheet\nTotal assets\n$629,963,786\n$588,231,651\n7%\nGross loans\n452,827,237\n414,984,843\n9%\nAllowance for loan losses\n9,106,258\n8,193,091\n11%\nNon-interest-bearing deposits\n242,497,582\n244,897,010\n-1%\nTotal deposits\n562,658,947\n529,311,149\n6%\nShareholders' equity\n57,280,548\n50,716,281\n13%\nNet Income\n$6,758,398\n$6,491,464\n4%\nNet interest margin\n4.33%\n4.05%\nTier 1 leverage ratio\n9.15%\n8.67%\nReturn on average assets\n1.11%\n1.17%\nReturn on average equity\n12.27%\n13.58%\nEfficiency ratio\n50.14%\n55.09%\nShare and Per Share Data\nBasic earnings per common share\n$2.80\n$2.98\nBook value per common share\n$23.64\n$23.15\nTotal common shares outstanding\n2,422,924\n2,190,786\nFourth Quarter Earnings\nFourth quarter 2017 net income was $846 thousand compared to $2.1 million in the third quarter of 2017, a 60% decrease and $1.8 million for fourth quarter of 2016, a 54% decrease. Both decreases were due to $1.5 million in additional tax expense arising from the one time revaluation of deferred tax assets.\nPretax income for the quarter ended December 31, 2017 was $3.65 million, an increase of $617 thousand, 20%, compared to $3 million for the quarter ended December 31, 2016 and an increase of 4%, $152 thousand over prior quarter.\nBasic earnings per share for the fourth quarter decreased $0.49 to $0.35, due to the impact of the increase in income tax expense for the fiscal year. Earnings per share for the year were also impacted by the 10% stock dividend granted to shareholders of record as of October 31, 2017.\nYear-to-Date Earnings\nFor the twelve months ended December 31, 2017, net income was $6.8 million compared to $6.5 million in 2016, an improvement of $267 thousand or 4%. Most of the improvement is located within interest income, which climbed $4 million, due primarily to growth in the loan portfolio combined with rising rates.\nFinancial Highlights\nAssets of $630 million Total deposits of $563 million Net income of $6.8 million for the year, a new record Return on average equity for the year of 12.27% Return on average assets of 1.11% for the year Efficiency ratio of 50.14% for the year Book value per share after dividends increased by $0.49 to $23.64 at year end Continued exceptional credit quality with no loans past due or on non-accrual\nLoans, Asset Quality & Deposits\nTotal assets declined by $4.3 million to $630 million in the fourth quarter but increased by $41.7 million compared to the prior year. The Bank's asset quality remained exceptional. For the fourth quarter, gross loans increased by $4.8 million. On a year to year basis, loans increased $37.8 million, 9% to $452.8 million. Allowance for loan losses of $9.1 million at December 31, 2017 represents an 11% increase over the same period last year. Deposits declined by 1%, $6 million since September 30, 2017 but grew 6%, $33.3 million to $562.7 million, over the last twelve months.\nNon-Interest Income / Expense and Net Interest Margin\nNon-interest income for the quarter ended December 31, 2017 was $525 thousand which represented a 45% decrease compared to the same period in 2016 and a 46% decrease compared to the quarter ended September 30, 2017. For the full year, non-interest income was $3.3 million, a decrease of 12% or $444 thousand from the prior year. The decrease can be attributed to the curtailment of SBA loan sales as Management decided to retain many high yielding loans generated by the Bank's top producing SBA Department. When strategically beneficial, SBA loan sales generate a significant portion of the bank's non-interest income.\nNon-interest expense for the quarter ended December 31, 2017 was $3.5 million, which was a 5% increase over the same period in 2016 but a 6% decrease from the quarter ended September 30, 2017. On a year-to-date basis, non-interest expense increased by 3.3%, most of which was due to an increase in Salaries and Employee Benefits as the Bank seeks to hire and retain the top bankers in its market.\nNet interest income of $6.8 million for the quarter ended December 31, 2017 was $317 thousand or 5% more than prior quarter and exceeded fourth quarter of 2016 by $1.2 million or 21%. The improvement year over year of 17% or $3.8 million, was driven by a continued focus on building high quality earning assets through loan production. Combined with rising rates, this focus enabled an improved net interest margin of 4.33% compared to 4.05% the prior year.\nShareholders' Equity\nTotal shareholders' equity was $57.3 million at December 31, 2017, a $6.6 million, 13% increase over December 31, 2016. The value added to our shareholders was due to continued strong earnings. This increase was reduced by the payout of quarterly cash dividends.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017, the Bank's return on average equity was 12.27% and return on average assets was 1.11%. The book value per share of Santa Cruz County Bank's common stock at December 31, 2017 was $23.64, up from $23.15 for the same period in 2016.\nNATIONAL, STATE, AND LOCAL RATINGS AND AWARDS\nFinancial Management Consulting (FMC) Group: The Bank ranked #1 in California for overall bank performance for the first and second quarters in 2017 among 185 California banks.
