REUTERS/Jean-Paul Pelissier \nSchiappa kicked off nationwide consultations on a law that is due to include steps to fight sexual harassment on the streets as well as extend the statute of limitation for rape of minors. \nIn late October, protesters in Paris disrupted the opening of a retrospective of Roman Polanski’s work following new rape allegations against the French-Polish film director. \nBut for Deneuve and the other signatories of the letter, including writers and journalists, this went too far. \n“This vigilante (online) justice has punished men in their jobs, forced some to resign, when all they did was touch a knee, try to steal a kiss, talk about ‘intimate’ matters in a work diner,” they wrote. \n“We defend a right to pester, which is vital to sexual freedom,” they said.
