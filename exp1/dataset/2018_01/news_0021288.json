Parson brings nearly two decades of successful financial leadership experience to CloudBees.\nWhile at NYSE-listed Red Hat, Parson was an integral part of the finance team for more than a decade. During this time, the company’s revenue grew from about $200 million to almost $3 billion, and Red Hat became the largest open source enterprise IT company in the world. Parson helped manage the organization’s tremendous growth, from about 800 employees to nearly 11,500 worldwide. Early in his Red Hat tenure, Parson gained international experience holding the position of EMEA finance director working in Ireland, then later becoming international controller, where he established new entities and managed finance teams across Europe, Asia and South America.\n“Matt has a robust financial background with extensive experience working with a multibillion-dollar open source company,” said Labourey. “His background speaks for itself. He has proven experience growing revenue and managing international financial teams. He’s joining us at an opportune time, as CloudBees looks to continue our momentum and accelerate through our next phase of growth.”\n\"I believe that Matt is uniquely qualified to drive the CloudBees financial strategy,” said Charlie Peters, CloudBees board member. “Matt has experience in high-growth environments, a deep knowledge of financial systems and familiarity with CloudBees customers, markets and subscription revenue models.”\nParson started his career in public accounting where he spent about six years with three of the Big 4 accounting firms, including Arthur Andersen, Ernst & Young and KPMG. During this time, he worked with large public companies and smaller private companies in industries ranging from technology to healthcare to financial services. Following his years in public accounting, Parson went to Red Hat where he worked his way from director, internal audit to treasurer.\n“I couldn’t be more excited to join CloudBees. The board and the management team are a remarkable group of professionals,” said Parson. “Furthermore, the CloudBees position within the DevOps industry is very impressive, and the DevOps movement has only just begun. I see huge opportunity for the company and feel strongly that 2018 is going to be a banner year for CloudBees.”\nAbout CloudBees\nCloudBees is the hub of enterprise Jenkins and DevOps, providing companies with smarter solutions for automating software development and delivery.
