But if you have bad credit, or none at all, your pool of options is decidedly smaller.\nFinancial services site WalletHub worked with a team of experts to crunch the numbers and determine which cards lead the pack in various categories for 2018, including ones catering to those without good credit.\nIf the issue is simply that your credit history is limited, WalletHub recommends the Capital One Platinum Credit Card . This card has fraud protection and no annual fee. After five months of making monthly payments on time, users get access to a higher credit line.\nBut if your credit history is spotty, WalletHub's pick is the Discover It Secured Credit Card with no annual fee.

They should also help users learn how to handle credit responsibly.\nshow chapters A couple who paid off $127,000 of debt shares their No. 1 money saving tip      12:38 PM ET Wed, 23 Aug 2017 | 01:08 Most of the time, the credit line on these account matches the amount you put down as a security deposit. However, that doesn't mean the card functions like a debit card: Money doesn't deduct automatically from an account when you swipe. You still have to make monthly payments.\nIt's possible to fall into the red while using a secured card, too. \"You can still accumulate debt if you make purchases and fail to pay your bills on time,\" Credit Karma reports . \"The amount you owe can quickly grow beyond the deposit you made, thanks to interest.\"\nBut if you pay off your bill in full every month, using a secured card will allow you build credit and eventually transition over to a traditional, unsecured card.\nDon't miss: Here's why you shouldn't close out old credit cards, even if you don't use them \nLike this story?
