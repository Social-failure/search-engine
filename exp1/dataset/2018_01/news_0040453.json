It decided to concentrate its activities in the Nordics.\nThe transaction is planned for the second half of 2018, the banks said, subject to regulatory approval. Terms of the deal were not disclosed.\nThe transaction will have a marginal positive impact on CET1 capital for Nordea, it said.\n(This story fixes spelling of Mottas in second paragraph.)\nReporting by Brenna Hughes Neghaiwi, editing by John Revill, John Miller\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-01-25T21:11:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-25T23:06:04.002+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
