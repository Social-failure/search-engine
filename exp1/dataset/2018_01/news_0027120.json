They argue that workers in Germany’s industrial sector already have shorter weeks than their peers in other countries and worry that reducing their hours further would hurt German competitiveness.\nIG Metall said more than 376,000 employees in the engineering sector had gone on warning strikes so far this year since a non-strike period ended on Dec. 31.
