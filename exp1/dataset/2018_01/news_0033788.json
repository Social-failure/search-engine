The ministry regularly conducts these auctions in an attempt to enhance market liquidity.\nThe bid-to-cover ratio, a gauge of investor demand at auctions, rose to 3.34 from the previous saleâ€™s 3.13.\nThe auction results helped offset negative pressures from U.S. Treasuries, which saw its 10-year yield edge up to a 3-1/2-year high amid the U.S. government shutdown.\n$1 = 110.7800 yen Reporting by the Tokyo markets team; Editing by Sherry Jacob-Phillips\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-01-22T12:15:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-22T20:40:25.051+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
