Anti-Doping Norway does not presume that such medicines should be used systematically to prevent asthma.” \nThe use of Therapeutic Use Exemptions (TUEs) and asthma medicines in endurance sports is a controversial topic, with no TUE necessary for certain medication up to specific limits. \nIn December 2017 it was revealed that cyclist and four-time Tour de France winner Chris Froome had excessive levels of salbutamol, the same substance Johnsrud Sundby had over-used, in his urine after a stage of the 2017 Vuelta a Espana. \nNorway’s neighbours and bitter rivals Sweden take a different approach to medication, which has led to a tense relationship between the two countries. \n“I don’t want to comment on how Norway medicate, but what we focus on is having a clear diagnosis when we give medicine,” Sweden team doctor Per Andersson told Reuters. \n“And naturally one shouldn’t medicate healthy skiers that don’t need medicine. That is a fundamental principle that is important to uphold,” he added. \nJohaug, a three-time Olympic medalist, was a notable omission from Norway’s team in the wake of a positive test in September, 2016 for the steroid clostebol. \nThe 29-year-old said the result was caused by an ointment called Trofodermin which she used to treat sunburnt lips during a training camp in Italy without knowing it contained a banned substance. \nThe Norwegian Olympic Committee banned Johaug for 13 months, effectively allowing her to compete at Pyeongchang, but the world governing body FIS appealed to the Court of Arbitration in Sport (CAS), which extended the ban past the Games. \nBarring a new directive from the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA), it is unlikely that Norway’s attitude to asthma medication will change before next month’s Games. \n“If one uses asthma medicines in the doses recommended for this illness and within the terms of the WADA doping list, we do not believe that there are any special benefits as a result of such use,” Anti-Doping Norway’s Thorsby said. \n“On the contrary, we believe that practitioners with documented asthma who do not get proper treatment will be at a major disadvantage.” Editing by Greg Stutchbury", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-06T15:14:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-06T15:34:03.031+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
