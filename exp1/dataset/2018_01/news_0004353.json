They say as a result Postbank shareholders are entitled to a much higher price for their holdings.\nA spokesman for Deutsche Bank said the complaint was unfounded, as were other similar suits that are currently making their way through the courts.\nA spokeswoman for the court declined to comment.\nGerman weekly WirtschaftsWoche first reported the lawsuit.\nKrauss, citing client confidentiality, declined to provide a copy of the lawsuit but confirmed the accuracy of the WirtschaftWoche article.\nWirtschaftsWoche said the lawsuit detailed examples of Postbank and Deutsche Bank acting in concert in 2008, including a strategy change to focus on retail customers and dropping riskier forms of business.\nIn addition, WirtschaftsWoche said Postbank and Deutsche Bank agreed on details of a planned capital increase, board changes and the elimination of a 2008 dividend.\nDecember 31 marked a deadline for taking legal action on the takeover.\nReporting by Hans Seidenstuecker; Writing by Tom Sims.
