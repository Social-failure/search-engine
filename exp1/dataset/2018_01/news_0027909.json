Alvarez was trailed by conservative lawyer Juan Diego Castro on 20.7 percent, according to the survey.\nFabricio Alvarado, an evangelical candidate of the National Restoration Party, was in third place, with 18.4 percent, the poll showed. The 2,800 person survey was conducted between Jan. 15-18, and had a margin of error of 1.9 percent, Opol said.\nNonetheless, as nearly 45 percent of those polled said they were undecided or likely to abstain, hope remains for 10 other presidential hopefuls.\nCandidates need to get 40 percent of the vote to avoid the runoff. Without that, the two highest-voted candidates would head to a second round, due on the first Sunday of April.\nEncumbent center-left President Luis Guillermo Solis can not seek immediate re-election under Costa Rican law.\nReporting by Enrique Pretel; Editing by Michael Perry\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-01-20T11:48:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-20T08:29:23.013+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
