(NYSE: AIZ), a premier global provider of risk management solutions, and The Warranty Group, a global leader of protection plans and related programs, and a portfolio company of TPG Capital, today jointly announced that they have amended the structure of their $2.5 billion transaction, previously announced on October 18, 2017. Under the revised terms, Assurant, Inc. will acquire TWG Holdings Limited and its subsidiaries, and remain a Delaware corporation. This change follows recently enacted U.S. tax legislation and allows Assurant to simplify the overall deal structure and optimize the transaction financing mix. The transaction is expected to close in the second quarter of 2018, subject to regulatory and other customary closing conditions.\nThe transaction remains valued at $1.9 billion in equity value or $2.5 billion of enterprise value, including The Warranty Group’s existing debt. As before, the acquisition is expected to be modestly accretive to 2018 Assurant operating earnings per share on a run-rate basis, and significantly more accretive excluding the amortization of transaction-related intangible assets. Accretion is now measured against a higher expected Assurant stand-alone earnings per share baseline, which reflects the net benefits from enacted U.S. tax legislation. Assurant will continue to be traded on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol AIZ.\nChanges from the new transaction structure include:\nTPG Capital and its affiliates will receive 10.4 million Assurant shares, or approximately 19.8 percent of the current shares outstanding. This represents a reduction from the 16.0 million shares to have been issued previously. In exchange for fewer Assurant shares, TPG Capital and its affiliates will receive increased cash consideration, totaling approximately $860 million, based on yesterday’s closing price, after taking into effect the transaction collar adjustment. Assurant has entered into a new commitment letter for a $1.5 billion bridge facility (increased from $1.0 billion) to reflect the new structure. Assurant currently expects to replace this bridge facility with a combination of debt and equity, subject to market conditions. The transaction will no longer be taxable to Assurant’s shareholders in the U.S. or other jurisdictions. Upon closing, Assurant’s board will be comprised of 14 directors, including two from TPG Capital.\n“We believe this simplified structure drives even greater value to shareholders, clients and employees, while also providing certainty on the benefits of tax reform to our global operations,” said Assurant President and Chief Executive Officer Alan Colberg. “Importantly, the acquisition remains a compelling, strategic transaction that advances our position as a leading vehicle protection provider, while building scale across other global lifestyle markets.”\nThe strategic rationale and other key terms previously announced are unchanged.\nThe combination of Assurant and The Warranty Group will significantly advance Assurant’s strategy in the global lifestyle market, with an attractive product and client portfolio, diversified growth profile and a deeper global footprint. By the end of 2019, Assurant expects to generate $60 million of pre-tax operating synergies by optimizing global operations. Assurant’s current senior management team will lead the combined organization.\nCONFERENCE CALL AND WEBCAST DETAILS\nAssurant will host a conference call and webcast today at 8:30 a.m. Eastern Time (U.S.) to discuss the transaction. The live webcast and investor presentation will be accessible in the Investor Relations section of assurant.com .
