The government has already given Hochtief’s bid the green light. \nThrough the takeover, Atlantia, controlled by the Benetton family, plans to create the world’s biggest toll road operator with a combined market value of more than 40 billion euros, though the offer has met with political hostility from Madrid. \nAfter the CNMV cleared Atlantia’s offer, the Spanish government asked the regulator to revoke the approval because the Italian group had not sought government permission to acquire Abertis’ satellite business, considered a strategic asset.
