Army and finance police helicopters were among those used in the evacuation. \nA year ago a massive avalanche razed a hotel in central Italy, killing 29. \nIn Switzerland, hosting the World Economic Forum in Davos this week, authorities went on avalanche alert on Monday after fresh snow smothered much of the Alps.
