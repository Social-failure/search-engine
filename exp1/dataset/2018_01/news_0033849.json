Greece’s top court has rejected Turkey’s request for the soldiers’ extradition and, therefore, they would not be sent back, he said.\n“The legal framework was presented from our side and it was hopefully fully understood by the Turkish side,” Kontonis said.\n“... The options are clearly stated in the Greek penal code, so therefore it is at Turkey’s discretion to take the appropriate legal steps,” he added, referring to the possibility of a trial taking place in Athens.\nThe eight men - three majors, three captains and two sergeant majors - flew to Greece by helicopter on July 16 in 2016, saying they feared for their lives. They requested asylum.\nTurkey has accused Athens of harboring coup conspirators. Greece denies this and says its justice system is independent of its politicians.\nReporting by Constantinos Georgizas, Renee Maltezou; Editing by Richard Balmforth\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-01-24T00:01:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-23T20:44:35.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
