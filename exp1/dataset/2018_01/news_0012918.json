Yes! Let’s sort this pay mess now,” Gracie said on Twitter.\nSeparately, the Equalities and Human Rights Commission, in charge of enforcing anti-discrimination laws, said it was asking the BBC for information about its pay policy and the facts in Gracie’s case.\n“We will consider whether further action is required based on this information,” said the commission, which can use courts and tribunals to enforce people’s rights.\nThe BBC did not comment on the statements from the commission or from Collins, but reiterated that its gender pay gap was significantly better than the national average.\nHall has pledged to close the gender pay gap by 2020.\nGracie has disclosed that she was paid 135,000 pounds ($182,440) a year as China Editor. Her counterpart Jon Sopel, the North America Editor, is paid between 200,000 and 250,000 pounds according to the BBC.\nReporting by Estelle Shirbon; editing by Stephen Addison\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-01-09T23:47:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-10T03:00:40.009+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
