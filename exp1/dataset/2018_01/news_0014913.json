Previously, Griffin was CEO of RG + Associates, a firm she founded in 2001 to focus on market strategy and business development consulting for emerging and diverse asset managers, which has annually sponsored its flagship ConsortiumEAST and ConsortiumWEST conferences for over a decade.\nIn her new role, Griffin will assist GCM Grosvenor in expanding its industry-leading small, emerging and diverse manager platform, which currently has cumulative commitments to small and emerging managers totaling $15 billion, including $3 billion in commitments to minority-owned and diverse asset managers across a number of asset classes. Griffin will focus on developing effective strategies for institutional investors, federal, state and local government agencies, corporations and non-profits to expand their exposure to high-quality emerging and diverse asset managers. Ms. Griffin will also be instrumental to integrating the Consortium conference series into the GCM Grosvenor Small and Emerging Managers Conference.\n\"As I explored a partnership to further the work of improving diversity in the asset management industry, I wanted to partner with a team that had a proven track record of doing so while generating top tier investment results,\" said Griffin. \"I have worked with GCM Grosvenor for many years, and have great respect and admiration for the firm's influence and market leadership in the smaller, emerging and diverse manager space. Specifically, I was drawn to the firm's full suite of capabilities, ranging from seeding managers, to anchoring fund commitments, providing secondary capital, and co-investing across the spectrum of the alternative asset management industry. Diversity and inclusion is at the heart of GCM Grosvenor's culture; the firm has a long history of being a catalyst for change in the industry and I'm excited to be joining the team,\" Griffin said.\n\"Having known of Renae's work for years when this opportunity arose, it was an easy, resounding 'yes,'\" said Michael Sacks, Chairman and CEO of GCM Grosvenor. \"This is a perfect fit - Renae has effectively convened LPs, GPs and other stakeholders to address the important issues associated with small, emerging, and diverse asset managers. Addressing these issues and driving outcomes is a highly valued part of GCM Grosvenor's work, and the opportunity to partner with Renae is exciting. Renae's Consortium series and our conference are the preeminent events in the space. We are excited to combine our efforts, deliver even more value to the marketplace and work together to drive equal access to capital for diverse asset managers,\" Sacks said.\nGriffin began her career in finance in 1982 with Bankers Trust Company in the commercial lending group.
