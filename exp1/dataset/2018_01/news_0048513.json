I will say that he can do more but that’s easy to say. Sometimes Lukaku might not be helped with Mourinho’s style of play. \n“I wish next season maybe, with one year under his belt, he’ll be even more consistent.” \nMourinho let Lukaku go at Chelsea but the Portuguese has continued to back his striker since their reunion, saying the Belgian offers more on the pitch than just goals. \nBut with the arrival of Chilean forward Alexis Sanchez from Arsenal this week, United have more attacking options and a further lack of goals could relegate Lukaku to the bench. \nSaha, who has also played in the Premier League for Everton, Fulham, Sunderland and Tottenham, hoped Sanchez could emulate Dutchman Robin van Persie, who left Arsenal for a successful spell at the Manchester club in 2012. UNPLAYABLE SANCHEZ \nVan Persie ended up as United’s highest scorer in his debut campaign at Old Trafford and helped guide the club to their 20th league title. \n“His speed, he has no fear. It’s impossible to mark those kind of players. He can play right, left, in the middle, play behind defenders... it’s unplayable,” Saha said of Sanchez. \n”When these players get players around them as well with desire to win titles... he can do amazing things at United. \n“If you remember Van Persie, who also came from Arsenal and destroyed the Premier League by himself in the first season. He killed it, we hope Sanchez will do the same.” \nThe 39-year-old Saha was speaking in Mumbai as part of Gulf Oil’s fan-building campaign for United’s supporters, who were invited to a live screening of the Premier League away fixture at Burnley on Saturday. \nUnited have struggled to compete for the title since the departure of long-term manager Alex Ferguson in 2013, but Saha feels they are a much-improved side under Mourinho. \n”They are consistent and look like a team who want to attack more than it used to,“ Saha said, with United now 12 points behind leader Manchester City after 24 league matches. ”Fans are happy, confidence is growing and the fear factor is back. \n“We need to get closer to City, they have been very consistent. I think it’s a good season, we will talk about it more in May.” Reporting by Sudipto Ganguly; Editing by John O'Brien", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-24T10:51:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-24T11:21:40.021+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
