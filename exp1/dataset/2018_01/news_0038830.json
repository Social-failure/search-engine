This is Venezuela breaking with its own constitutional order and the international community saying this is unacceptable,” he said.\nReporting by Arshad Mohammed; writing by David Alexander; editing by Doina Chiacu\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-25T20:44:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-25T21:27:25.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
