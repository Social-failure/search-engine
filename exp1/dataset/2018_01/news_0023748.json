Update on Shareholders consultation by SRC\nThe Company has completed the previously announced shareholder consultation. The feedback received was presented and taken on record by the Board on January 11, 2018\n6. Signing of the Advance Pricing Agreement (\"APA\") with the US Internal Revenue Service\nInfosys has concluded an Advance Pricing Agreement (\"APA\") with the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (\"IRS\"). Under the APA, Infosys and the IRS have agreed on the methodology to allocate revenues and compute the taxable income of the Company's U.S. operations. This agreement covers financial years from 2011 to 2021. The APA will enhance predictability of Infosys' tax obligations in respect of its U.S. operations.\nIn accordance with the APA, Infosys has reversed tax provisions of approximately US$ 225 million made in previous periods which are no longer required (both under International Financial Reporting Standards and Indian Accounting Standards). Further, in line with the APA, Infosys expects to payout approximately US$ 233 million due to the difference between the taxes payable for prior periods as per the APA and the actual taxes paid for such periods. This amount is expected to be paid over the next few quarters.\nThe reversal of the tax provisions of approximately US$ 225 million had a positive impact on the consolidated Basic EPS for the quarter ending December 31, 2017 by approximately US$ 0.10. Further, on account of the APA methodology, Infosys expects its overall effective tax rate to be lower by about 100 basis points for future periods covered under the APA.\n7.
