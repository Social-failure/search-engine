Boeing’s shares fell slightly. \n“It’s reassuring to see that facts and evidence matter,” said Chad Bown, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics in Washington. “This part of the trade policy process works unimpeded despite President Trump’s protectionist rhetoric.” \nIn a statement, Bombardier called the decision a “victory for innovation, competition, and the rule of law,” and a win for U.S. airlines and the traveling public. \nBoeing said it was disappointed that the commission did not recognize “the harm that Boeing has suffered from the billions of dollars in illegal government subsidies that the Department of Commerce found Bombardier received and used to dump aircraft in the U.S. small single-aisle airplane market.” \nDelta said it was pleased with the decision and looked forward to introducing Bombardier’s CS100 to its fleet.

REUTERS/Lucy Nicholson/File Photo \nFormer ITC chairman Dan Pearson praised the decision. “Not a single commissioner was willing to buy Boeing’s arguments,” he said. “I think ‘America First’ is a policy of the White House and the Commerce Department. But it’s not the policy of an independent agency (like the ITC).” \nThe decision may end up helping Trump’s plan to boost U.S. jobs as the CSeries jets for U.S. airlines will be built in Alabama rather than Canada. BOEING WIN EXPECTED \nThe ITC had widely been expected to side with Chicago-based Boeing, which alleged it was forced to discount its 737 narrowbodies to compete with Bombardier, which it said used government subsidies to dump the CSeries in the United States during the 2016 sale of 75 jets at “absurdly low” prices to Delta Air Lines. \nThe ITC, which currently has four commissioners, did not give an explanation on Friday for its decision. Related Coverage British PM May welcomes Bombardier's trade victory over Boeing \nThrough a venture with European planemaker Airbus SE, which has agreed to take a majority stake in the CSeries this year, Bombardier plans to assemble CSeries jets in Alabama to be sold to U.S. carriers starting in 2019. The case has sparked trade tensions between the United States and its allies Canada and the UK. Ottawa last year scrapped plans to buy 18 Super Hornet fighter jets from Boeing. \nThe British Prime Minister’s office said it welcomed the decision “which is good news” for the British industry, while Canada’s Innovation Minister said the IRC came to the “right decision” on Bombardier. \nThe fate of the CSeries and the well-paid jobs associated with the plane are important both to Ottawa and the British government. Bombardier employs about 4,000 workers in Northern Ireland, whose Northern Irish political party is helping keep Prime Minister Theresa May in power.
