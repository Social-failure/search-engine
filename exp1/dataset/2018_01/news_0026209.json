That takes time,” GMB General Secretary Tim Roache told BBC radio.\n“What we said to Greg Clark yesterday was we need more time, those companies need more time and we’ve suggested this taskforce be set up that is led by the government, that includes trade unions representing the workers, that includes businesses.”\nA spokesman for the business ministry’s insolvency service declined to comment when contacted by Reuters.
