(Reuters) - The California parents accused of imprisoning their 13 children in the family’s squalid home beat, starved and chained them to their beds for years, taunting them with apple pie, according to a prosecutor on Thursday who called it a case of “human depravity.” \nThe father, 57-year-old David Turpin, is also accused of sexually abusing one of his young daughters, Riverside   Mike Hestrin told reporters in announcing the charges before the couple’s first court appearance later on Thursday. \n“A case like that sticks with you and haunts you,” Hestrin said. “Sometimes in this business you are faced with human depravity, and that’s what we have here.” \nTurpin and his wife, Louise, 49, each face 94 years to life in prison if convicted on the more than two dozen charges that include torture, child abuse and false imprisonment \nThe couple was arrested on Sunday, and the conditions in their home in Perris, California, discovered after their emaciated 17-year-old daughter climbed out of a window of the family home and called police. \n“The 17-year-old victim that escaped has been working on a plan with the siblings to escape this abuse for more than two years,” Hestrin said. “She escaped through a window and took one of her siblings with her. That sibling eventually ... became frightened and turned back.” Riverside   Mike Hestrin announces charges against David Turpin, 56, and Louise Turpin, 49, in Riverside, California U.S. January 18, 2018. REUTERS/Lucy Nicholson \nHestrin said that the couple may have unlocked two of their children after police arrived at the family home but a 22-year-old remained chained to a bed. \nHe said the victims were chained for weeks or even months at a time, not released even to use the bathroom. They were allowed to shower only once or twice a year and given little food.
