REUTERS/Regis Duvignau/File Photo \nThe provisional deal was signed during a state visit to China by French President Emmanuel Macron. \nAirbus said the latest Tianjin agreement would result in production increasing to six aircraft per month - up from four at present - at the local final assembly line for the Airbus A320-family of jets. \nThe industrial ramp-up will target five aircraft by early 2019 and six per month by early 2020, it added in a statement. \nA Beijing signing ceremony did not, however, include any deal for Airbus to sell aircraft to China, despite earlier expectations of a contract timed to coincide with Macron’s visit. \nIndustry sources had said Airbus was negotiating to sell around 100 planes to China’s state purchasing agency, though a deal had not been flagged as part of the diplomatic preparations for the visit. \nNew orders for Airbus jetliners have historically featured during such state visits by French leaders. \nChina regularly splits large orders between Europe and the United States to cope with its fast-expanding airline traffic, but the momentum has recently been with rival Boeing ( BA.N ), which sold 300 jets during a visit by U.S. President Donald Trump last year. \nChina, however, placed a large order for 140 Airbus jets during a visit to Germany by President Xi Jinping last July. \nSome sources say Chinese officials are disappointed about a deal last year for Airbus to buy the CSeries jet project from Bombardier ( BBDb.TO ), derailing talks with Chinese investors after Ottawa intervened to keep the struggling program in Western hands.
