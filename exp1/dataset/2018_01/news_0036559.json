We'll make a long-term deal on immigration if, and only if, it is good for the country.\" Getty Images White House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders. \nThree days into a government shutdown, Trump has yet to make a public appearance, although he has issued a number of tweets accusing Democrats of prioritizing non-U.S. citizens over citizens. \nAsked to respond to criticism from both Democrats and Republicans that the president has been absent from the tense negotiations on Capitol Hill, Sanders said Monday's vote in the Senate proved that, \"what the president did clearly worked.\" \nFollowing the passage of the Senate cloture bill Monday afternoon, the next step in reopening the government would be a final Senate vote on the bill, which funds the government for 17 days, ostensibly allowing congressional negotiators to hash out a DACA solution in that time. \nA House vote on the measure has yet to be scheduled, but provided it passes, the bill would go to Trump's desk for his signature. \nHundreds of thousands of federal employees remained on furlough Monday afternoon, even as prospects improved significantly that they would return to work on Tuesday.
