Survey respondents earn an average of $57,426 and spend 17 minutes traveling to work. Just 46 percent are married.\nCheck out the infographic from Thermosoft below to see how else Americans across the country define success and how they are doing now:\nLearn more about this infographic at Visual Capitalist . \nLike this story?
