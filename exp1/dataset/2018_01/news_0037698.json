It is due to release the interim results on Feb. 28.\nEsprit is undergoing a multi-year revamp that includes store closures, price adjustments, new return policies, and technology and distribution upgrades.\nIt said in November it would continue downsizing effort to accelerate closure of loss-making retail stores and expect improvement in gross profit margin and operating expenses to outweigh the negative impact of revenue decline.\nThe company has expected controlled retail space to shrink by single digits in percentage terms in the current financial year with falling revenue.\nEsprit shares dived more than 15 percent in early trade at HK$3.44, their lowest since April 1999.\n$1 = 7.8176 Hong Kong dollars Reporting by Donny Kwok; Editing by Sherry Jacob-Phillips\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-01-25T10:04:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-25T13:16:04.058+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
