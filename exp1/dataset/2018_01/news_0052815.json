The harvest usually runs from November through April when the weather is normally dry and temperatures cool. The cane plants generally yield the most sugar from January through March.\nRainfall has been above the historic average since November and particularly so in January, the local weather service reported.\nIt can take up to two weeks for milling to recover after heavy rains due to rustic conditions in the plantations and lower yields.\nCuba consumes between 600,000 and 700,000 tonnes of sugar a year and has an agreement to sell China 400,000 tonnes annually. It sells the rest on the open market.\nSugar was long Cuba’s most important industry and export with output reaching 8 million tonnes in 1991, but today it ranks eighth in exports behind sectors such as tourism, tobacco, nickel and pharmaceuticals.\nReporting by Marc Frank; Editing by David Gregorio\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-01-29T23:23:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-30T18:44:49.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
