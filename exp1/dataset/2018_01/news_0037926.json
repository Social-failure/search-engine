The measure, which would reopen the government through Feb. 8, cleared a procedural hurdle in the Senate on Monday afternoon but must still pass the Senate and House of Representatives before it can become law.\nIt was not immediately clear whether the matter would delay the Senate’s final vote on the new funding plan.\n“We want every tool in our basket that we can to give the American people the assurance that we know exactly what’s going on, and that we are at least in agreement that (intelligence operations) proceed forward, not that they have a free rein,” Burr said.\nBurr and Warner requested that the language in the bill be replaced with a measure written by leaders of congressional intelligence committees, but the effort was rejected. Burr ended the discussion “with great disappointment.”\nWhite House officials did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\nReporting by Patricia Zengerle; Editing by Peter Cooney\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-01-23T04:34:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-23T07:48:29.072+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
