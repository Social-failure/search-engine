Lawyers for the other pharmacists did not respond to requests for comment.\nProsecutors say that 778 people nationwide were sickened after being injected with mold-contaminated steroids produced in unsanitary conditions at Framingham, Massachusetts-based NECC. Of those, 76 people died, prosecutors said.\nProsecutors said the trio, who worked in NECC’s packing area checking orders pre-shipment, approved the delivery of drugs based on obviously fake prescriptions made out to patients including Wonder Woman and Flash Gordon.\nU.S. District Judge Richard Stearns had found that trio was at most engaged in clerical tasks such as checking the address on a package’s mailing label, “incidental” conduct not covered by the statute’s prohibition on dispensing misbranded drugs.\nBut U.S. Circuit Judge O. Rogeriee Thompson wrote that Stearns incorrectly assumed the trio acted not as pharmacists at NECC but as shipping clerks, a proposition that prosecutors dispute. Thompson said jurors should hear the factual dispute.\n“We agree with the government that the major flaw in the judge’s and the defendants’ analyses is that the indictment says nothing -- zippo -- about the defendants’ having simply checked addresses or worked as clerks,” Thompson wrote.\nThe decision came ahead of the Jan. 31 sentencing of Chin’s husband, Glenn Chin, a former NECC supervisory pharmacist who prosecutors said cut corners while overseeing the production of drugs, including the tainted steroids.\nA federal jury in October found him guilty of racketeering and mail fraud charges but cleared him of second-degree murder in connection with the deaths of 25 people who were injected with mold-tainted steroids that NECC produced.\nBarry Cadden, NECC’s co-founder and former president, was sentenced in June to nine years in prison after being found guilty of racketeering and fraud charges but similarly being cleared of murder.
