Amazing, given SPX is up almost 9% since then,” DoubleLine Capital LP Chief Executive Jeffrey Gundlach said Thursday on Twitter, referring to the junk bond ETF.\nBut junk bonds trade within a range, or spread, of lower-risk debts, leading some managers to say their ability to appreciate further is limited. U.S. bond yields have marched higher since September, pushing prices lower. The 10-year Treasury benchmark hit 2.63 percent on Thursday, the highest in 10 months, having hit 2.02 in September.\nJanus Henderson Group plc fund manager Bill Gross told Bloomberg News last week that he had gone negative on high-yield bonds.\nGross has described the bond market generally as being in a bear market, but investors remain confident in other sectors.\nStock and bond funds based in the United States took in money overall during the week, with equities attracting $9.1 billion, taxable bonds taking in $2.5 billion and municipal bond funds reeling in $1.2 billion, Lipper said. The data covers U.S. -based funds.\nReporting by Trevor Hunnicutt; Editing by Jennifer Ablan and Diane Craft\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-01-19T06:48:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-19T00:54:36.015+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
