Its complete disarray on the Republican side,\" referring to conflicting immigration demands floated over the past several months by the Trump administration.\nInstead of passing a month-long patch to government spending, Schumer proposed a \"very short-term\" bill to keep the government running that he said could spark a deal over the next few days on immigration and overall spending levels through Sept. 30, the end of this fiscal year.\nHouse passage came only after conservatives secured a promise from House Speaker Paul Ryan that he would soon advance some type of legislation to bolster U.S. military readiness, said Republican Representative Mark Meadows.\nMeadows, head of the conservative House Freedom Caucus, did not provide details and Ryan aides were not immediately available for comment.\nCHILDREN'S HEALTHCARE EXTENSION\nAs of late on Thursday, there was no visible sign that Republicans who control Congress would meet Democrats' demands for including a plan for the \"Dreamers\" in the temporary spending bill.\nBesides extending government funding for a month to give negotiators more time to work on a longer deal, the temporary spending bill would extend for six years the Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP) for low-income families.\nRepublicans inserted the measure in a move partly to lure Democratic support.\nNevertheless, Schumer said earlier on Thursday that the House bill to fund the government was very likely to be unacceptable to the Senate.\"\nWith the fate of the spending bill uncertain, federal agencies were being instructed to prepare for partial government shutdowns throughout the country on Saturday.\nIf money were to run out, many federal agencies would be shut down and workers sent home. But \"essential services\" dealing with public safety and national security would continue.\nThe 2018 fiscal year began last Oct. 1. Congress' inability to agree on overall funding levels has meant that the government has been operating on a series of temporary measures that mainly kept spending at the previous year's levels.\n(Reporting by Richard Cowan and Amanda Becker; Editing by Peter Cooney)", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-19T04:25:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-19T05:10:28.014+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
