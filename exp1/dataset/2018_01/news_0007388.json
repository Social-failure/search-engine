Authorities did not give a cause of death but said investigations were under way.\nThis month Sudan devalued its pound currency to 18 per U.S. dollar from 6.7 pounds to the dollar previously.\nAmid the continuing unrest, the exchange rate on the black market hit about 29.5 pounds to the dollar on Monday, compared with 28 pounds to the dollar a day before.\nState Minister of Interior Babkar Daqna denied that the demonstrations were in response to price rises and said that destructive protesters would be “dealt with forcefully”, state news agency SUNA reported on Sunday.\nReporting by Khalid Abdelaziz; writing by Nadine Awadalla; editing by Mark Heinrich\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-08T19:57:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-08T20:24:48.001+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
