It is designed to complement the U.S. Commerce Department’s durable goods orders report, which it typically precedes by a few days. \nELFA’s index is based on a survey of 25 members that include Bank of America Corp, BB&T Corp, CIT Group Inc and the financing affiliates or units of Caterpillar Inc , Deere & Co, Verizon Communications Inc, Siemens AG, Canon Inc and Volvo AB . \nThe Equipment Leasing & Finance Foundation, ELFA’s non-profit affiliate, said its confidence index for January was at an all-time high of 75.3, up from 69.4 in December. \nA reading of above 50 indicates a positive outlook.
