Some of the cuts he hit off the tee were insanely long. He’s got his speed back, which is awesome to see.”\nWoods, 42, is making his first appearance in an official event since spinal fusion surgery last April.\nHis best shot came at the 188-yard, par-three 16th, a six-iron that climbed sharply into the wind and landed softly, almost going in for a hole-in-one, before settling eight inches away.\n“He hit the same club (as me) and it came out like a completely different window,” Reed said. “Mine came out a normal window, his was about 30 feet higher than that. It was monstrous up in the air. Into the wind you wouldn’t think a ball would carry the ball that far.\n“I imagine he’s probably jumping with joy just being out here playing golf, especially being pain free. That is huge. I hope he plays well tomorrow so we can see him on the weekend.”\nReed, a five-times PGA Tour winner, shot a 68 to trail leader Tony Finau by three strokes.\nEditing by Peter Rutherford\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-01-26T09:36:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-26T21:22:11.039+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
