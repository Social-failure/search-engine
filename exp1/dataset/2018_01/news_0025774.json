Questions of competence are wholly secondary.”\nReporting by Georgina Prodhan; Editing by Ludwig Burger\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-01-12T21:59:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-13T14:40:20.021+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
