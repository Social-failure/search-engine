Around 75 percent of its leather goods now cost just under 1,000 pounds ($1,400), or less.\nIn spite of a tougher balancing act on costs, Mulberry was “fully, fully committed” to Britain, Andretta added, speaking on Monday.\nThe label - whose bags have been sported by celebrities including Prince Harry’s fiancee, actress Meghan Markle - trades off its UK heritage and the skills of its craftsmen.\n“We want to continue this and I hope one day when we grow perhaps we will even consider opening another factory,” said Andretta, who used to run Italian fine jewellers Buccellati and has worked at labels like LVMH’s Celine.\nManufacturing bases outside Britain include Italy and Spain.\nDIGITAL GENERATION The brand is expanding sales overseas, branching into Japan with a partner.\nMulberry’s like-for-like retail sales, which compares stores that have been trading for a year or more, were down 1 percent in the United Kingdom in the six months to end-September and fell 3 percent overseas in that period. But international revenue growth sped up thereafter.\nThe label, majority-owned by Singapore billionaires Christina Ong and Ong Beng Seng, will roll out a China-based distribution centre later in 2018 to help it expand online shopping and speed up deliveries, Andretta said.\nRevived spending from Chinese consumers, who account for around a third of luxury goods purchases worldwide, fuelled strong revenue growth at industry leaders like Louis Vuitton owner LVMH in 2017.\nMulberry is also trying to capture a younger clientele with updated designs and strategies. From February, its catwalk collections will be instantly available, rather than months later as is usual.\nNew designs like the Amberley bag and a revamped version of the brand’s classic Bayswater are now among bestsellers, Andretta said.\n“We are growing strongly with the digital generation,” Andretta said. Sales of older bag models were slowing slightly, offset by growth in newer versions, he added. “The younger consumer is moving to the modern version of Mulberry.”\n$1 = 0.7104 pounds Editing by Adrian Croft\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-01-30T15:33:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-31T16:14:11.012+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
