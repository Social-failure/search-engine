Among others, Malaysia’s national energy company Petronas also announced plans last year to expand their LNG sales in Southern China.\nThe price of LNG delivered to Asia hit $11.70 per million British thermal units this month, its highest level since November 2014, according to the Platts JKM benchmark price.\nChinese LNG imports rose by almost 50% in 2017, and the country has now eclipsed South Korea to become the world’s second-largest importer behind Japan.\nThe extra imports still haven’t been enough for some parts of Chinese industry.\nOn Dec.12, BASF stopped producing some chemicals at a Chongqing-based facility due to “a supply shortage of natural gas,\" it said at the time. The company told The Wall Street Journal on Tuesday that its production remained suspended and it is unclear when it will resume.\nYunnan Yuntianhua said on Dec. 13 that its ammonia and urea production lines in the southwest province of Yunnan were halted due to “partial suspension in natural gas supply in southwest regions” to ensure heating demand for residents during the winter, according to a company filing to the Shanghai Stock Exchange.\nAnalysts say that given Beijing’s very public commitment to improving air quality, the shift away from coal is unlikely to lose urgency over the medium term. But neither will Chinese policy makers let citizens freeze, meaning that gas supplies will continue to be diverted to households.\n“It’s clear that Beijing will continue its push to reduce reliance on coal,\" said Fan Qingtian, senior analyst at Changjiang Futures Co. It isn’t unusual for Chinese policy makers to implement broad rulings that lead to unintended consequences, he said.\nChina has committed to increasing gas’s share of its energy mix to 10% by 2020 from its current level of around 7%. That could increase annual gas demand by more than 50% from 2016 levels to 325 billion cubic meters, according to Bernstein.\nEven after accounting for the growth, gas consumption in China will remain a fraction of consumption in Germany, Japan or the U.S: a sign of the long-term potential in the market, Bernstein analysts also said.\n“There’s an issue of how quickly can this be achieved without creating bottlenecks and price spikes especially when it’s cold,\" said Kerry Anne Shanks, head of Asia Pacific LNG research at consultancy Wood Mackenzie.\nThe surge in demand from China couldn’t have come at a better time for the LNG market. A wave of new projects in Australia, the U.S. and Russia have helped keep the price of LNG at almost half its 2014 peak of more than $20 per million BTUs.\nRoyal Dutch Shell PLC, the biggest LNG shipper and producer, estimates that from 2016 to 2020, trade will increase by one-third to 350 million tonnes a year.\n“I think part of the reason they [China] decided to do this was they knew they could purchase extra amounts from the market without tripling the price of LNG,” said Alan Townsend, senior energy specialist at the World Bank.\nAs it takes in more gas, China has been beefing up import facilities, according to consultancy Energy Aspects.\nAt the end of last year, China had the capacity to import 56 million tonnes of LNG a year and that is set to rise by a third to 74 million tonnes by 2020. A new pipeline from Russia to China is due to be completed in 2019, plus production from domestic gas fields is ramping up.\nThe move to gas is set to stay.\n“Once certain cities, industries go into gas, they can’t get out; it’s that simple, even if the price increases,” said Javier Moret, global head of LNG at RWE Supply & Trading GmbH.\n— Yifan Xie contributed to this article.\nWrite to Sarah McFarlane at sarah.mcfarlane@wsj.com and Nathaniel Taplin at nathaniel.taplin@wsj.com", "external_links": ["https://djcs-olympics.s3.amazonaws.com/custom-data-charts/custom-data-chart-wsj-0.8.29.min.js"], "published": "2018-01-23T13:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-23T19:20:56.027+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
