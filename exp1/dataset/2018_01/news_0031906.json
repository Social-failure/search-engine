(OTC Pink: VPOR), (\"Company\" or \"Vapor Group\"), announced today that its new wholly-owned subsidiary, CryptoTechCurrency, Inc. ( http://www.cryptotechcurrency.com ), a cryptocurrency mining company, has purchased 5 additional mining machines with state-of-the-art flexibility to increase profitability.\nYaniv Nahon, President, stated, \"As we had already announced our initial purchase of 25 'high hash rate' cryptomining servers are in the process of going into service. In the interest of expanding our capabilities immensely, we have purchased five cryptomining dedicated hardware \"'igs', each with 8 Nvidia Model Geforce GTX 1070TI video cards, that are capable of mining 99% of all existing cryptocurrencies in existence on a 24/7 basis. Important, these rigs give us the ability to convert to whatever cryptocurrency on any given day is the most profitable, greatly increasing our flexibility and the potential profitability of this operation.
