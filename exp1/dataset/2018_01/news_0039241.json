Analysts were expecting profit of $2.49 per share.\nAbbott said it expects an adjusted tax rate of 14.5 percent to 15 percent for 2018. The company reported an adjusted tax rate of 16.5 percent in the fourth quarter.\nReporting by Divya Grover and Manas Mishra in Bengaluru; Editing by Supriya Kurane and Arun Koyyur\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-01-24T20:59:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-24T15:11:59.002+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
