That was the highest level since January 2012 and followed an upwardly revised $48.9 billion shortfall in October.\nEconomists polled by Reuters had forecast the trade deficit increasing to $49.5 billion in November after a previously reported $48.7 billion deficit in the prior month.\nPart of the rise in the trade deficit in November reflected price increases. When adjusted for inflation, the trade deficit rose to $66.7 billion from $65.6 billion in October. The so-called real trade deficit for October and November was above the third-quarter average of $62.0 billion.\nThat suggests trade will probably subtract from gross domestic product in the October-December quarter. The chronic trade deficit has garnered the attention of Republican President Donald Trump, who has blamed it for the massive loss of U.S. manufacturing jobs as well as moderate economic growth.\nThe government reported last month that trade contributed 0.36 percentage point to the economy's 3.2 percent annualized growth pace in the third quarter. The Trump administration believes that a smaller trade deficit, together with deep tax cuts, could boost annual economic growth to 3 percent on a sustained basis.\nImports of goods jumped to a record high of $204.0 billion in November. Capital goods imports were the highest on record. Imports of consumer goods rose to their highest level since March 2015. The strong growth in imports is being driven by robust consumer demand.\nThe country's import bill was also pushed up by imports of industrial supplies and materials, which were the highest since January 2015.\nImports from China were unchanged in November. Exports of goods increased 2.3 percent to $200.2 billion in November, the highest on record. There were strong increases in exports of industrial supplies, petroleum and capital goods.\nOverall exports of goods are being supported by recent dollar depreciation and a strengthening global economy, which is helping to underpin the manufacturing sector.\nExports to China fell 1.9 percent. The politically sensitive U.S.-China trade deficit rose 0.6 percent to $35.4 billion in November.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-05T15:48:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-05T16:00:01.023+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
