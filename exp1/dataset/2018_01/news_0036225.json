Optiv is uniquely positioned to help these organizations optimize their security programs and minimize costs. We are thrilled to have Simon’s exceptional business and leadership skills, and security and professional services industry expertise to help us bring our extensive capabilities to organizations based in Europe, and to better serve our global clients headquartered in other parts of the world.”\nChurch brings to Optiv more than 25 years of experience running global technology and managed services programs, and spearheading sales efforts for public and private organizations. He currently serves as an advisory board member for Glasswall Solutions Limited, where he advises the U.K.-based document security company on its international go-to-market strategy. He has helped numerous companies, including Vodafone and NTT Com Security (formerly Integralis), build or restructure vital business units. He has also held various executive and sales leadership positions at companies such as Verisign and NetIQ.\n“Increasingly, Optiv’s partners and global clients are looking for support in Europe, the second largest cyber security market in the world,” Church said. “As the most respected pure play security provider in North America, Optiv’s international expansion meets a very real and growing need to help European-based national and multinational companies make their enterprise security programs stronger, simpler and less costly. I am looking forward to leading Optiv’s provision of transformative services to companies in Europe and working locally with their unparalleled technology partner community.”\nFollow Optiv\nTwitter: www.twitter.com/optiv\nLinkedIn: www.linkedin.com/company/optiv-inc\nFacebook: www.facebook.com/optivinc\nBlog: www.optiv.com/resources/blog\nNewsletter: www.optiv.com/optiv-advisor\nAbout Optiv Security\nOptiv is a market-leading provider of end-to-end cyber security solutions.
