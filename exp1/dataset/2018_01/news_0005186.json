Republicans have attacked Mueller’s probe as politically motivated, prompting concerns among Democrats that Trump would fire him.\nDemocratic Senator Richard Blumenthal urged lawmakers on Friday to support legislation protecting the special counsel, citing the Times report. “Explosive evidence of obstruction - and imminent danger to Special Counsel. White House Staff need to testify before grand jury,” Blumenthal wrote on Twitter.\nReporting by Doina Chiacu; Editing by Bill Trott\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-05T17:11:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-05T17:25:10.006+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
