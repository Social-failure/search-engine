China later lowered the tariffs but Washington said it had not done enough to comply. \nThe initial U.S. complaint followed China’s 2010 imposition of anti-dumping duties of up to 105.4 percent, and anti-subsidy duties of up to 30.3 percent, on U.S. broiler chicken products. \nChina lowered the duties in 2014 to a maximum of 73.8 percent and 4.2 percent respectively after the WTO ruled in Washington’s favor. But the U.S. Trade Representative said they still broke the rules and went back to the WTO in 2016. \nBy that time, the U.S. Department of Agriculture said U.S. poultry producers such as Tyson Foods Inc ( TSN.N ) and Pilgrim’s Pride Corp ( PPC.O ) had lost sales of over $1 billion.
