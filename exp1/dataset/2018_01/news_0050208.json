His East Belfast constituency includes a Bombardier plant that produces wings for the CSeries. \nTrade unions were similarly jubilant. \n“Bombardier workers in Northern Ireland and throughout the supply chain in the UK will be breathing a huge sigh of relief that the ITC has seen through Boeing’s baseless complaint,” said Steve Turner, assistant general secretary of the Unite union. \n“There can be no backsliding from the U.S. government on this decision.” Reporting by James Davey and Conor Humphries; Editing by Mark Potter", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-27T12:46:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-27T14:24:23.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
