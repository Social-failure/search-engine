It might well (become the next big issue),” Pound told Reuters in a telephone interview from Florida.\nHe said that the scandal had not been on the IOC’s horizon when the agenda for next week’s meeting was drawn up.\n“Certainly if there is no indication that anybody is going to do it there is always the opportunity under ‘other business’ to say, ‘Hey, maybe perhaps we haven’t had a chance to get the right back swing in here, but what is the IOC going to do with the whole problem?” he said.\nThe IOC banned Russia last month from Pyeongchang over “systematic manipulation” of the anti-doping system at the 2014 Sochi Games. It left the door open to athletes with no history of doping to compete as “Olympic Athletes from Russia.”\nA total of 169 Russian athletes have been cleared to compete at the Pyeongchang Olympic Games.\nWHO ELSE TO BLAME? With Nassar condemned to spend the rest of his life behind bars, the focus has shifted to the coaches, federations and institutions, including the USOC, that allowed the abuse in U.S. gymnastics to go unchecked.\nOn Wednesday, the USOC threatened to decertify USA Gymnastics unless the 18 members on the board of directors were replaced. Several resigned as a result of the scandal, and USA Gymnastics said on Friday that its remaining directors would also step down.\nThe USOC itself has also been attacked by some of gymnastics’ biggest names.\nRaisman, a triple Olympic gold medalist, said that both USA Gymnastics and the USOC had been quick to capitalize on and celebrate her success.\n“But did they reach out when I came forward? No,” she said in court this week.\nThe outspoken Pound, who spearheaded the initial WADA investigation into widespread state sponsored doping in Russia, said the IOC was limited in what pressure it can bring to bear directly on the USOC.\nFor the moment, he said, it would probably be content with monitoring the situation in the United States.\n“I think they (the IOC) would probably sit on the sidelines and see what happens,” said Pound. “You’ve got to be careful about interfering in other countries where you have no legal rights ... If they got involved it would be pretty informally.”\nPound said the USOC had now jumped into the difficult and painful issue “with both feet,” a situation that he described as “better late than never.”\nReporting by Steve Keating in Toronto; Editing by Daniel Wallis\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-01-27T07:45:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-27T13:03:16.018+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
