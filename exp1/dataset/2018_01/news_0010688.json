While these firms are not traditional activist investors, they are part of a growing cadre of U.S. money managers who have taken a page out of the activist hedge funds' playbook by agitating for change at companies.\nNeuberger Berman sent an open letter on Dec. 12 to Nuance's board of directors urging the company to immediately sever ties with Ricci, who has been CEO of the company since 2000. Neuberger, which owns a 1.6 percent stake in Nuance, making it the 12th largest shareholder, said it had lost confidence in the management succession plan because there had not been an update on the CEO search in over a year.\nNeuberger portfolio manager Amit Solomon added in the letter that the board's governance and nominating committees \"act in deference to Mr Ricci,\" and that Ricci \"seems to have no intention to relinquish control of the company and may try to continue to exert influence as CEO, Chairman, or in another capacity.\"\nIvory Investment Management, the seventh largest shareholder in the company, sent a letter on Dec. 20 to Nuance's board, expressing concern that Ricci was backtracking on his decision to retire. That letter, seen by Reuters, urged the company to quickly announce a new CEO.\nNuance has a market capitalization of around $5 billion. (Reporting by Liana B.
