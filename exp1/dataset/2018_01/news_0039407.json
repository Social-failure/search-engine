REUTERS/Mario Anzuoni \nAnsari, thought to be a front-runner for his Netflix comedy series “Master of None,” made headlines after a woman described feeling violated following an awkward date last year. Ansari said he believed their sexual activity was consensual. \nWhile women are not expected to turn out dressed in black en masse for the SAG awards, as they did at the Jan. 7 Golden Globes, many of the movies and TV shows up for honors have strong female points of view.

Blige, is also in the mix. \nThe SAG awards are indicators of likely Oscar success because actors form the largest group of voters in the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences. \nSAG also hands out awards for television, with “Big Little Lies,” female wrestling drama “Glow,”“The Handmaid’s Tale,”“The Crown” and women’s prison series “Orange is the New Black” all competing.
