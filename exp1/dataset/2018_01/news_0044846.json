That means that we should be able to expect very limited and possibly no changes to market access as a result of the free trade deal that we negotiate.”\nHunt added that Britain would over time be able to take a “sovereign decision” as to where its regulations do or do not diverge.\nReporting by Kate Holton; editing by Costas Pitas\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-01-26T15:57:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-26T11:49:15.014+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
