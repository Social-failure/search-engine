On Thursday he tried to elaborate on his position, noting that the administration still backs a strong dollar in the long term. \nHowever, the dollar fell against its global competitors both days, reaching a 12-month low Thursday, and is down more than 11 percent over the past 12 months. President Donald Trump himself has said that a weak dollar is preferable for the U.S. economy at this point. \nDalio, who runs the largest hedge fund in the world with $150 billion in assets, was not alone in his criticisms. Banking analyst Dick Bove of the Vertical Group also said Mnuchin's comments threaten to unravel the economic recovery. \nInterestingly, Moody's Investors Service said the dollar's longer trajectory could be higher, despite the dive this week. \n\"We expect to see dollar volatility as U.S. policy discussions progress, but overall for 2018 we expect the U.S .dollar to strengthen slightly given the continued tightening of US monetary policy,\" said Elena Duggar, associate managing director at Moody's. \nWATCH: Mnuchin not worried about the dollar . show chapters", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-25T18:54:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-25T19:05:24.006+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
