It said the task force of U.S. government and non-governmental representatives would meet for the first time on Feb. 7. \nCuban Communist Party newspaper Granma said it was “destined to subvert Cuba’s internal order.” \n“In the past, Washington has used phrases like ‘working for freedom of expression’ and ‘expanding access to internet in Cuba’ to cover up destabilizing plans,” Granma wrote, adding that some 40 percent of Cubans connected to the internet in 2017, 37 percent more than in 2010. \nSome analysts said the creation of the task force seemed counterproductive. \n“By casting the issue of internet access in an explicitly political frame, it will only create greater obstacles for those U.S. telecom companies that have made inroads toward partnerships with the Cuban side,” said Michael Bustamante, an assistant professor of Latin American history at Florida International University.

Critics have said the government fears losing control. \nFormer U.S. President Barack Obama made improved internet access a central part of his efforts to normalize relations with Cuba. Telecommunications equipment and services were among the first exemptions to the embargo after Washington and Havana said in 2014 that they would restore diplomatic relations. \nGoogle signed an agreement with Cuba in 2016 granting internet users there quicker access to its branded content. \nCuba has balked at allowing U.S. companies to participate in wiring the country.
