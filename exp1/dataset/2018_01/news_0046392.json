You would expect to see an acceleration in volatility,” he said.

REUTERS/Kai Pfaffenbach \n“We did have those comments, and it added to the drama,” Anderson said. \nThe market was likely to take a breather now but the underlying trend for a gradually weakening dollar remained intact, Anderson said. \nUBS Wealth Management upgraded its six-month forecasts for the euro on Friday to $1.28, from $1.22. \nThe dollar found little support after data showed U.S. fourth-quarter gross domestic product increased at a 2.6 percent annual rate, held back by a modest pace of inventory accumulation. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast a 3 percent increase. \n“Today’s U.S. growth print may prompt some modest soul-searching amongst interest rate bulls but does little to change the fact that the economy has considerable momentum behind it,” Karl Schamotta, director of global product and market strategy at Cambridge Global Payments, said in a note. \nThe dollar slipped to a session low against the Japanese yen JPY= after Bank of Japan Governor Haruhiko Kuroda said the central bank expects the economy to continue growing at a moderate pace and inflationary expectations are picking up slightly. \nThe pound GBP= rose after Britain's economy unexpectedly picked up speed in the last three months of 2017, adding to the view that the hit from the Brexit vote was not as bad as expected.
