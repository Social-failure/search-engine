It raised its percentage stake slightly in Exxon Mobil and kept it steady in Thyssenkrupp and China Petroleum & Chemical Corp. \nLast year, the fund proposed dropping oil and gas companies from its benchmark index, which would bring huge changes if approved by parliament as part of a shift from fossil fuels under the 2015 Paris climate accord. \nThe fund’s board is also considering excluding particularly inefficient emitters in sectors such as oil and gas, cement and steel. \nThe emissions data used in the survey was drawn from a report in November by Thomson Reuters with Constellation Research & Technology, emissions tracking group CDP and BSD Consulting that showed few of the top emitters had strong climate goals. \nReuters compared the emissions against the fund’s own publicly accessible database of equity holdings. \nTim Nixon, director of sustainability at Thomson Reuters, said the data indicated a good start “but to be effective you really need to pick out the laggards from the leaders.” \nThe Norwegian fund wants companies to provide as much data as possible, something that would help investors make climate change goals part of their investment decisions. \n“For us as an investor to be able to assess the companies we need numbers, including carbon emission numbers,” spokeswoman Marthe Skaar said. \nSome companies are starting to track emissions from the use of their products. Unilever, for instance, says it helps consumers save energy and emissions with washing powder that works at lower water temperatures. \nData on consumption shows trends in environmental performance but means overlapping accounts. Jet fuel, for instance, can be listed under the airline that uses it, the oil company that produced it or even the firm that made the engines.
