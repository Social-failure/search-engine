Trump, a Republican, won the state-by-state electoral college vote which decides the winner of U.S. presidential elections.\nAny further delay in investigating voter fraud is likely to further weaken Trump’s allegations. But investigating voter fraud might complicate efforts by DHS to help states prevent cyber attacks on the 2018 midterm elections.\nThe commission, which Democrats and voting rights experts have attacked as meritless, was established in May last year but its work stalled when many states refused its request for data about registered voters.\nGiven almost no advance notice, DHS officials scrambled on Wednesday night to inform stakeholders that Trump’s mandate would not interfere with efforts to help state and local election officials bolster their voting infrastructure against potential cyber attacks, according to a senior U.S. official.\nThe order to investigate claims of voter fraud might damage cooperation with states on cyber security, which officials see as a threat heading into the midterms in November.\nStates have been increasingly eager to work with the Trump administration on cyber issues but many have criticized the voter fraud initiative, saying it is groundless and distracts from legitimate issues, like hacking threats.\n“If (DHS) were to start investigating these non-existent voter fraud claims, that would be very problematic,” said Edgardo Cortes, Virginia’s chief election official, who rejected the commission’s request last year for data about voters registered in Virginia. Cortes said he would also turn down DHS if it asked for the same data.\nWhite House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders told reporters on Thursday that the Trump administration was sending “preliminary findings” to DHS, which would “make determinations on the best way forward from that point.”\nDHS spokesman Houlton added that Kansas Secretary of State Kris Kobach, a former co-chairman of the White House’s now-disbanded election integrity commission, was not advising DHS.\nKobach told news media this week that he expected officials from Immigration and Customs Enforcement, a branch within DHS, to continue the work of the commission. Kobach’s office did not respond to requests for comment from Reuters.\nReporting by Dustin Volz and Julia Harte; Editing by Alistair Bell\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-05T22:28:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-05T22:39:29.026+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
