Nik Popovic contributed 14 points before fouling out, while Jordan Chatman also scored 14 and Steffon Mitchell hit for 13 points.\nTerance Mann tallied a game-high 21 points for the Seminoles (13-5, 2-4), while CJ Walker scored 19 and Braian Angola netted 17. But Florida State shot miserably all night, making only 27 of 80 field goal attempts to negate a 50-36 advantage on the glass.\nThe Seminoles did give themselves a chance over the final five minutes, getting as close as five points with 51 seconds left when Angola sank a 3-pointer. But Boston College was able to salt it away at the foul line, converting eight consecutive freebies in the final 37 seconds.\nMitchell started the carnage 34 seconds into the game with a 3-pointer. Robinson checked in with a layup and then sank two free throws on the next trip down the court. Jordan Chatman drilled a 3-pointer and Popovic canned a jumper for a 12-5 lead 3:17 into the contest.\nThings never really got better for the Seminoles, who played and shot like a team that had exerted itself over 50 minutes to outlast Syracuse on Saturday. After establishing their first double-figure lead before the second TV timeout, the Eagles threw a knockout blow just before halftime.\nThey rattled off 12 straight points in a 3:32 span. Chatman hit consecutive 3-pointers - the first directly off an inbounds pass when Florida State was caught napping after a turnover - to up the lead to 18. The margin was 41-25 at halftime.\nThe result was notable for Boston College, and not just because it squared its conference record at .500. It won just two ACC games total in the last two seasons.\n--Field Level Media\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-01-16T10:35:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-16T13:34:45.011+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
