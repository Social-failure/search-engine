Southeast Asia is the world’s third-biggest ride-hailing market after China and the United States.\nGo-Jek, a play on the local word for motorbike taxis, delivers everything from meals and groceries to cleaners, masseuses and hairdressers across Indonesia’s capital city Jakarta, all at the touch of a smartphone app.\nThe company, which began as a ride-hailing app for motorcycle taxis, was set up by Nadiem Makarim, a graduate of the Harvard School of Business and a former associate with McKinsey, who has quickly become a poster child for start-up success in Indonesia.\nReporting by Anshuman Daga; Editing by Edwina Gibbs and Muralikumar Anantharaman\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-29T07:18:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-29T07:43:54.007+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
