( bit.ly/2Cx1LQr ) \nGM Canada sold 302,826 vehicles in 2017, up 13.3 percent over the previous year, contrasting with sales in the much bigger U.S. market where the Cadillac maker recorded a fall of 1.3 percent. \nHowever, Fiat Chrysler Automobiles ( FCHA.MI ) ( FCAU.N ), reported a fall in monthly and yearly sales, hurt by a lower demand for its Jeep and Dodge branded vehicles in Canada. \nThe company said it sold 17,654 vehicles in December, a drop of 6 percent compared to the year earlier. Full-year sales fell 4.2 percent to 267,052 vehicles. \nFord reported an 11.1 percent drop in monthly auto sales, selling 17,565 vehicles in December. However, full-year sales were up by 1.3 percent. \n“We are expecting a decline in auto sales for the year in 2018,” Scotiabank analyst Carlos Gomes said, noting that a slower Canadian GDP growth and vehicle price increases outpacing income growth to be likely factors.
