As Storm Eleanor batters parts of Britain and Ireland, people arrive for work in the financial district of London, Britain, January 3, 2018. REUTERS/Simon Dawson \nThe storm hit Ireland’s fourth largest city, Galway, particularly hard as high tides late on Tuesday forced road closures and wreaked havoc for shop owners. \nIreland’s Electricity Supply Board (ESB) said at one stage on Tuesday 150,000 homes and business were without electricity. \n“We’re really hopeful, given that it’s the last week of a lot of people’s Christmas holidays, that we will have power back to pretty much everybody by tonight,” Derek Hynes, Operations Manager for ESB, told national broadcaster RTE. \nThe weather service’s second highest level of alert remained in place for the west and northwest of the country. Met Eireann said a combination of high tides and exceptionally high seas would result in coastal damage and further flooding. \nThree people died in October when Tropical Storm Ophelia battered every corner of Ireland, bringing down trees and power lines and whipping up 10-metre (30-foot) waves.
