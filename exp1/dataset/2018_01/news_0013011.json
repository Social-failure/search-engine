REUTERS/Bassam Khabieh Among the dead civilians were 21 women and 30 children, Zeid said.\nBacked by Russian strikes, Syrian government forces have escalated military operations against Eastern Ghouta in recent months. Russia rejects accusations that its jets have been targeting civilians.\nZeid Ra'ad Al Hussein, U.N.

REUTERS/Denis Balibouse Zeid said failure to evacuate urgent medical cases from the enclave was also against international humanitarian law.\nArmed opposition groups holed up in Eastern Ghouta had also continued to fire rockets into residential areas of Damascus, which he said caused terror among the population.\nA rocket landed near a bakery in Old Damascus on Jan. 4, killing a woman and injuring 13 other civilians, he said.\nReporting by Tom Miles; Editing by Robin Pomeroy and John Stonestreet\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-10T13:57:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-10T14:10:33.028+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
