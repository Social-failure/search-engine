The arrangements represented \"unprecedented conflicts of interest\" because Trump oversees the federal government and has not divested from properties he owns or that carry his name , Public Citizen, a nonpartisan group, said in the report.\nShortly before taking office last year, Trump said he would hand off control of his global business empire to his sons Donald Jr. and Eric, and move his assets into a trust to help ensure that he would not consciously take actions as president that would benefit him personally .\nMany government and private ethics watchdogs said the president should have gone farther, divesting assets that could cause a conflict of interest.\nThe White House declined comment on the Public Citizen report, which is based on filings to the U.S. Federal Election Commission and news stories. It referred the issue to the Trump Organization. A spokesperson there did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\nRepresentatives of four foreign governments — Kuwait , Malaysia , Saudi Arabia and Turkey — held events at the Trump International Hotel in Washington, the report said.
