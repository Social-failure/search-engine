Its revenue is expected by analysts on average to have surged 45 percent in 2017, a rare accomplishment for a company of its size.\nSome hedge funds used Friday's drop in Facebook's stock to bolster their positions, said Joel Kulina, a senior trader at Wedbush.\n\"Guys were hoping there would be more of a pullback so they could buy more,\" Kulina said. \"They don't think there are any real cracks in the Facebook story.\"\nChanges to Facebook's News Feed may have an impact on major suppliers of news and other content.\nJohn Ridding, the chief executive of the Financial Times, warned on Friday that the domination of online advertising revenue by search and social media platforms was putting pressure on media firms.\n\"The FT welcomes moves to recognize and support trusted and reliable news and analysis. But a sustainable solution to the challenges of the new information ecosystem requires further measures,\" he said.
