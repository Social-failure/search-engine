The government and the opposition have been in on-off talks for years to reach an agreement to ease the deep political and economic crisis in the oil-rich country. \nJorge Rodriguez, Venezuela’s communications minister, said in a statement to the press on Wednesday that a “pre-agreement” had been signed, but gave no further details. \n“Today is a day for joy, despite being long and arduous,” he said.
