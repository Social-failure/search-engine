The company reported a net loss of $34.4 million or minus $0.77 per share for the fourth quarter of 2017, compared with a net loss of $67.0 million or minus $1.52 per share in the same quarter last year, and net loss of $5.9 million or minus $0.13 per share in the third quarter of 2017.\nAdjusted EBITDA (1) for the fourth quarter was $7.7 million, compared with adjusted EBITDA (1) of $1.5 million in the same quarter last year, and adjusted EBITDA (1) of $18.8 million in the third quarter of 2017.\nFor the full year, net sales were $1.3 billion and net loss was $44.3 million or minus $1.00 per share. This compares with net sales of $869.5 million and a net loss of $105.5 million or minus $2.39 per share for full-year 2016. Adjusted EBITDA (1) for the year was $68.7 million, compared with adjusted EBITDA (1) of $24.0 million in the prior year. The improvement over the prior year was driven primarily by recovering energy and industrial end-market demand, new business and favorable raw material spread.\n\"Company performance improved significantly in 2017, including an annual sales increase of more than 50 percent and an adjusted EBITDA margin that nearly doubled. In the fourth quarter, we had record productivity despite fewer operating days due to maintenance and traditional customer seasonality. Our results also are beginning to reflect the impact of several price increases, with structural EBITDA improving over the third quarter,\" said Tim Timken, chairman, CEO and president. \"Last year, while quickly ramping up to meet improving market demand, we also laid a foundation to improve future performance at all points in the economic cycle. We demonstrated top-quartile safety performance; we strengthened customer relationships and captured a larger market presence; and we continued to lead the industry in innovation, enhancing our quench-and-temper capabilities and launching a series of patent-pending products that set new standards in engineered steels. The momentum we created during 2017 positions us to deliver greater value to customers and shareholders both in the coming year and throughout the cycle.\"\nFOURTH-QUARTER 2017 FINANCIAL SUMMARY\nFourth-quarter net sales increased $126.7 million or 59.0 percent year over year and had similar net sales sequentially.\nShip tons were approximately 286,000, an increase of 48.0 percent over the fourth quarter of 2016 and a decline of 1.4 percent sequentially, due to seasonality. Gains over the prior year were related primarily to market recovery and sales initiatives, including winning new business supplying billets to tube makers. Surcharge revenue of $77.6 million increased 197 percent from the prior-year quarter as a result of an increase in the No. 1 Busheling Index and higher volumes. Compared with the third-quarter 2017, surcharge revenue was relatively flat.\nAdjusted EBIT (1) was a loss of $10.8 million, compared with an adjusted EBIT (1) loss of $17.3 million for the same period a year ago and adjusted EBIT (1) of $0.2 million for third-quarter 2017.\nYear over year, fourth-quarter adjusted EBIT (1) improved primarily due to higher volumes and favorable raw material spread, partially offset by product mix. Sequentially, adjusted EBIT (1) was unfavorable, driven primarily by higher maintenance costs from annual shutdown activities. Melt utilization was 68 percent for the quarter, compared with 50 percent in fourth-quarter 2016 and 74 percent in third-quarter 2017. Higher volumes, primarily from new business, improved melt utilization for the year and leveraged manufacturing costs.\nFirst-Quarter 2018 OUTLOOK\nShipments are expected to be between 3 percent and 6 percent higher than fourth-quarter 2017 due to first-quarter seasonality. Earnings are projected to be between a net loss of $3 million and net income of $7 million. EBITDA is projected to be between $20 million and $30 million. Raw material spread is expected to be higher in the first quarter, primarily due to an increase in the average No. 1 Busheling Index.\nOther Guidance\n2018 capital spending is projected to be $40 million.\nThe company will host a conference call at 9 a.m. EST on Friday, January 26, to discuss its financial performance with investors and securities analysts. The financial results and conference call materials will be available online at investors.timkensteel.com .\nTimkenSteel Earnings Call Information:\nConference Call\nFriday, January 26, 2018\n9 a.m. EST\nToll-free dial-in: 844-579-6824\nInternational dial-in: 734-385-2616\nConference ID: 3494025\nConference Call Replay\nReplay dial-in available through February 2, 2018\n855-859-2056 or 404-537-3406\nReplay passcode: 3494025\nLive Webcast\ninvestors.timkensteel.com\nAbout TimkenSteel Corporation\nTimkenSteel (NYSE:TMST, timkensteel.com ) creates tailored steel products and services for demanding applications, helping customers push the bounds of what's possible within their industries.
