Analysts on average expected $2.66 per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. \nRevenue for the quarter rose 22 percent to $6.05 billion, exceeding Wall Street estimates of $5.7 billion. \nThermo Fisher also said it will spend $34 million on one-time $500 bonuses for each of its 68,000 eligible non-executive employees and another $16 million for philanthropic activities and to accelerate key research and development programs. \nThe combined $50 million comes from a benefit the company realized as a result of U.S. tax reform. \nIt also increased its quarterly dividend to 17 cents per share from 15 cents. \nThermo Fisher said it would provide a 2018 earnings forecast on a conference call later on Wednesday. Analysts are estimating 2018 earnings of $10.63 per share and revenue of $23 billion, according to Thomson Reuters data.
