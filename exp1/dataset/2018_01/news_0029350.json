Home Capital Group Inc fell 1.1 percent to C$15.33 after the country’s biggest alternative lender said on Wednesday it had received a statement of claim from short seller Marc Cohodes, who is seeking C$4 million ($3.2 million) in damages. \n* At 10:34 a.m. EST (1534 GMT), the Toronto Stock Exchange’s S&P/TSX composite index was down 3.79 points, or 0.02 percent, at 16,322.91.
