According to the trader, since 2009 the market has \"respected the top end of this channel, which is your ceiling or resistance,\" and it has also \"respected the bottom side which is support, or the floor.\"\n\nOn a longer-term chart of the Nasdaq 100, Gordon points out that the parallel channel on the weekly chart and that of the monthly chart are about to collide at around 7,100, leaving him to believe that 7,100 is the level at which he wants to protect his profits.\n\"An overshoot to the upside is totally possible,\" he said. \"But I can almost promise you that when, not if, we do return back inside of this channel, at some point this lower support will break, we will probably come down.\"\n\nAll three major market indexes were down Monday, with the Nasdaq composite falling for its third time in four trading days. The Nasdaq 100 was still trading at around 6,986, just below the levels at which Gordon wants to be cautious.\nVote Vote to see results Total Votes: Not a Scientific Survey.
