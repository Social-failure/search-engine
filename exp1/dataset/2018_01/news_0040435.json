Any broad monetary policy tightening could risk destabilizing economic growth, economists say.\n“We should increasingly rely on reform, opening up and innovation to propel transformation and foster new economic drivers,” Li said at the meeting on Monday.\nThe meeting was held to gather opinions on the annual government work report scheduled to be published in March.\nFAW Group [SASACJ.UL] Chairman Xu Liuping said at the meeting that China should expedite mixed-ownership reform in state-owned enterprises.\nZhang Shiping, chairman of Shandong Weiqiao Pioneering Group [SDWQP.UL], said stable policies can stimulate private investment, while Morgan Stanley economist Robin Xing said China should tap the potential of small cities to drive consumption.\nReporting by Ryan Woo; Editing by Richard Borsuk\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-01-24T12:14:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-24T08:19:20.007+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
