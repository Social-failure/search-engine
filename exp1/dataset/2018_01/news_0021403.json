Our strategy of range renewal and geographic expansion is continuing to bring results. In 2018, we will pursue our growth and internationalization of our sales in line with the Drive The Future plan,” said Groupe Renault Executive Committee member Thierry Koskas in a statement. \nLast October, Renault presented its “Drive The Future” company strategy plan, under which Renault plans to increase annual sales to 5 million vehicles by 2022 while also aiming for a 7 percent operating profit margin and 70 billion euros (£62.17 billion) in revenue.
