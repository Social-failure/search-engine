The SOA said one, seen 2.5 kilometres (km) east of the wreck site around 0600 local time on Thursday, may indicate leakage of extremely toxic bunker fuel, the heavy oil used in ship engines. \nIt remain unclear how much bunker fuel was left aboard the tanker, the Sanchi (IMO:93356608), when it sank. Experts estimated it may have been carrying about 1,000 tonnes at the time it collided with the CF Crystal (IMO:9497050) grain freighter. \nBunker fuel is noxious to marine organisms and difficult to remove from the sea once spilled, unlike the condensate fuel - an extremely light form of oil - that was being shipped by the Sanchi at the time of the collision.

But water samples taken at four of the total 22 spill sites detected so far were found to exceed petroleum substance standards.
