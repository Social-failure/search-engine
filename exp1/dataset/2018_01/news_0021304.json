Right now it’s the most important thing,” she said before setting off at a blistering pace under the watchful eyes of coach David Engstrom.\nAPPLICATION PERIOD “Eventually, we want them to reach the elite. It’s a very long way, and this is just the start of that long road,” Engstrom said as the skiers raced away.\n”We’ve just completed an application period, and I’d say we take in around eight (athletes) every year. It’s up to themselves how good they can be.\n“They decide the level of ambition, and how much time they put into training and everything else they need to become really good.”\nAlbertsson and the cross-country students train alongside the school’s biathletes, who are coached by Jean-Marc Chabloz, a four-time Olympian from Switzerland who has made his home in the area.\n“We have good clubs in the area who work with young people, so we have them served up to us on a silver platter,” Chabloz said as he gave the teenagers shooting tips.\nDespite his own Olympic history, where he took part in the Games in Albertville, Lillehammer, Nagano and Salt Lake City, the 50-year-old said it was not essential for him that the athletes go on to compete at the Games, or in the World Cup.\n“I wouldn’t say that’s what drives me as a coach, it’s more about creating a platform so that they can move on in their sporting lives, or in something else. But obviously it’s great when they succeed in sport,” he explained.\nSchool sporting director Michael Soderkvist and his team of teachers and coaches look after the student athletes, making sure they stay focused on their studies as well as their dreams of representing Sweden at a future Olympics.\n“The goal is to give students a chance to get an education, and in combination to see how far you can get with your sporting talent,” Soderkvist said.\nWRESTLING WITH MATHS Back in the classroom, some of the student athletes wrestle with mathematics while those with no lessons scheduled sit on sofas in common areas, catching up on schoolwork or talking through the competitions they took part in at the weekend.\nAside from winter sports, the school offers a number of other pursuits such as soccer, basketball and fencing.\nThe local soccer club in Ostersund, which the school is in regular contact with, is set to meet Premier League giants Arsenal in the last 32 of the Europa League in February.\nFor Soderkvist, Sweden’s long-held tradition of making both sport and education accessible to all is the secret behind the success of the programs offered by similar schools, where there are no tuition or coaching fees.\n“If we compare it to the States, where most of the sports are in college or schools or the private market, it’s very much different here. Because of this culture with no-profit clubs, many people can afford to do sport,” Soderkvist said.\nThe school is one of many with such programs all over Sweden, and every year dozens of athletes from the age of 16 and upwards apply to attend.\nThe handful of chosen athletes aim to follow in the footsteps of Charlotte Kalla, who had a similar high school education before going on to win multiple Olympic gold medals, and will head to Pyeongchang as one of the country’s brightest medal hopes.\nJulia Albertsson is typical of the well-mannered, conscientious teenagers attending the school, and though she could never be described as cocky or arrogant, the 17-year-old is crystal clear about her burning ambition to emulate Kalla.\n“You work successively, year after year, to be better, and in the end you want to get to the Olympics,” she said.\nEditing by Sudipto Ganguly\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-16T15:15:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-16T15:31:38.012+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
