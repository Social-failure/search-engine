It has raised 4.7 billion euros in four previous placements. \nCredit Suisse ( CSGN.S ) and Goldman Sachs ( GS.N ) are acting as joint bookrunners for the overnight placement, which is aimed at institutional investors and marks the fifth time in 10 months that Bayer has moved to sell Covestro stock. \nAbout 18 million shares will be placed at 86.25-88.46 euros apiece for proceeds of 1.55-1.59 billion euros, one of the banks said in a note to investors. Bayer has agreed to a 90-day lockup period. \nBased on Covestro’s current market value, this would amount to as much as 8.9 percent, which would bring Bayer’s direct stake, currently at 24.6 percent, to below 16 percent. The Bayer Pension Trust holds a further 8.9 percent stake. \nCovestro shares were 1.9 percent lower in late trading in Frankfurt ( 1COV.F ), while those of Bayer ( BAYGn.F ) were down 1.3 percent.
