At the time, BC Partners and Nordic Capital had vied to take control of the group.\nDermapharm makes treatments against skin diseases, insect bites and hair loss, as well as allergy drugs and Tiroler Nussoel-branded sun tan lotion.\nReporting by Ludwig Burger and Hans Seidenstücker; Editing by Douglas Busvine, Gareth Jones and David Evans\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-15T18:23:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-15T18:49:05.054+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
