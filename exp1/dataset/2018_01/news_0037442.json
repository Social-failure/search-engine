The SPD leadership tried on Monday to appease critics by demanding that the conservatives make concessions on immigration and healthcare. \nAn RTL poll conducted on Monday indicated the party’s support had dropped a point to 17 percent, well below the 20.5 percent it won in September, itself a post-war low, and just four ahead of the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD). \nMerkel, Horst Seehofer, the leader of her Bavarian CSU allies, and SPD head Martin Schulz met on Monday to discuss the timetable of negotiations. \nSchulz said that “we will talk about all the topics we addressed in the exploratory talks again”. \nSPD General Secretary Lars Klingbeil told the public broadcaster ARD that the SPD wanted to add a “hardship provision” to an agreement that caps the number of family members who can join refugees already accepted in Germany at 1,000 a month. \nHe also hoped the conservatives would give ground on the single “citizen’s insurance” that the SPD wants to replace Germany’s dual private and public healthcare systems. \nIf SPD leaders fail to deliver more, the risk increases that the party’s 443,000 members might reject a final deal when they are asked to vote. \nA conservative-SPD ‘grand coalition’ has governed Europe’s economic powerhouse since 2013, and a re-run appears to be Merkel’s best chance of securing a fourth term as chancellor.

NO CONCESSIONS? \nSchulz, whose leadership was on the line on Sunday, said the vote handed him a “duty to fight for all those who voted against”. Slideshow (2 Images) \nSPD parliamentary leader Andrea Nahles said she would negotiate “until the other side squeals”. \nBut Volker Bouffier, a lawmaker for Merkel’s Christian Democrats (CDU), ruled out any major changes to the blueprint. \n“The key issues can no longer be called into question,” he told the daily Bild. \nJuergen Hardt, conservative foreign policy spokesman in parliament, told Reuters the formal negotiations could begin this week and might be concluded by mid-February. \n“Changes (to the blueprint) can only be made by mutual consent, because everyone has already given up something to get to the agreement in the exploratory talks,” he said. “The cornerstones are clear.” \nBoth parties suffered heavy losses to the far right in September’s election and Merkel was weakened further by the collapse in November of coalition talks with the Greens and the pro-business FDP. \nThe blueprint envisages a review of the next government’s progress after two years to assess if changes are needed, sparking speculation that the conservatives might also be engineering an opportunity for Merkel to step down.
