It did not name the company it was in talks with for the stake sale. \nThe asset manager said the reason for the termination was “solely a result of the parties’ commercial consideration in respect of the possible transaction”. The company did not elaborate. \nPeople familiar with the matter said that the announcement referred to Value Partners’ talks with HNA for the stake sale. \nValue Partners declined to comment beyond the exchange filing when contacted by Reuters, while HNA did not immediately respond to request for comment. \nShares in Value Partners were set to open down 2.5 percent in the Hong Kong trading on Friday.
