Poland as well as Bulgaria have already faced legal action over air quality issues.\nReporting by Robert-Jan Bartunek; additional reporting by Samantha Koester, Editing by William Maclean\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-30T13:32:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-30T13:55:32.026+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
