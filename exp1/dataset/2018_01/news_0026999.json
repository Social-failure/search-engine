When it’s too much, (it) becomes dangerous for the health,” he said. \n“I would not like to see here retirements. Conditions that create a bad show for the crowd. The crowd is suffering, too, there.” \nOrder of Play:", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-17T16:02:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-17T16:06:56.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
