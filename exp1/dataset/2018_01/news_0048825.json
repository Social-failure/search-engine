Keurig Green Mountain also announced plans to purchase Dr Pepper Snapple , and Sanofi said it would buy Ablynx . \nGabelli says he's a buyer of General Electric shares after their recent pullback, based on its industrial business. GE shares are up 1.5 percent on Monday. He said his firm is just starting to buy. \nLive entertainment is an opportunity for investors, Gabelli said, saying he likes Liberty Braves (which is Liberty Media Corp. Series C), and Madison Square Garden . \nHe owns shares of casino operators Wynn and MGM and says he would continue to hold Wynn even without its CEO, Steve Wynn , at the helm. Wynn shares are plunging, down another 8.7 percent on Monday, after the chief executive was accused of sexual misconduct over a number of years. MGM's stock is up 2.2 percent. \nGabelli also said oil services companies are well-positioned, saying he is adding to his holdings of Halliburton and buying shares of a smaller Minneapolis-area fracking company called Twin Disc , sending its shares up 14 percent in midday trading Monday. \nNew priorities in Washington around infrastructure and defense spending, coming on top of tax reform, could continue to propel the markets higher. \nGabelli said, \"I'm still very optimistic as I generally am over the next six to nine months.\" He says he doesn't believe the market is overheated at the moment. \n\"It's not like 1999 when doctors were looking at the quote machines while they were operating,\" Gabelli said. \"You're seeing a flow of funds. Is it too much? Not yet.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-29T20:35:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-29T20:36:22.016+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
