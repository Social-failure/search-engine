THIS IS NOT A DRILL.” \nAuthorities canceled the alert six minutes later in an effort to stop it from being sent to people who hadn’t already received it. But it took 38 minutes for a second alert to be sent out canceling the first, and officials at all levels said Sunday the incident exposed significant flaws in the emergency-alert system.
