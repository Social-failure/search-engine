[O/R]\n“With oil prices now looking up, we anticipate good interest and more people would come in for exploration,” he said.\nThe last date to submit bids is on April 3 and the contracts are expected to be signed by the end of July, he said.\n“This is the biggest offering (of blocks) in the last decade and we are offering a high-quality area, as the companies themselves have chosen it,” he said.\nAbout 65 percent of the 55 blocks are on land and mostly in the northeastern state of Assam and western states of Gujarat and Rajasthan.\nIndia is estimated to hold 42 billion tonnes or 315 billion barrels of oil and gas resources, he said.\n“Of this, 220 billion barrels are yet to be discovered,” he said.\n(This story corrects to discovered from recovered in final paragraph.)\nReporting by Nidhi Verma and Neha Dasgupta, editing by David Evans\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-01-17T23:57:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-18T01:05:34.017+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
