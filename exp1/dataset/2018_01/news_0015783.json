He had been serving a life sentence for ordering the murders of nine people including actress Sharon Tate. \nThe Sony Pictures movie is to be released on Aug. 9, 2019, exactly 50 years after Tate and four friends were stabbed or shot dead. \nDeadline and Variety said that Australian actress Margot Robbie has been asked to play Sharon Tate. Tom Cruise, Brad Pitt and Al Pacino are also rumored to be interested, or are being sought, for the movie. \nSony Pictures, part of Sony Corp, did not return a request for comment on the casting. \nThe movie will be the first Tarantino film to be released without the Weinstein Company following allegations by more than 70 women of sexual misconduct against its former chief executive Harvey Weinstein. \nWeinstein, who has denied having non-consensual sex with anyone, was fired last November and his independent production company is currently up for sale.
