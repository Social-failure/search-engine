Four others are missing, said a security source, who also said the bodies of four suspected Boko Haram militants were found at the scene. \nA government spokesman was not immediately available for comment. \nA local police source said heavily-armed assailants entered the village on motorcycles and other vehicles, one of which was painted in the colours of Niger’s army. Fighters had stripped villagers of their mobile phones hours before to prevent them from alerting the authorities, residents said. \nTroops were taken by surprise and abandoned their position, allowing the militants to confiscate 10 armoured vehicles before retreating to their stronghold in neighbouring Nigeria, the security sources said. \nAir force and other troops have since reached the area and allowed soldiers to regain control of the position, they said. \nBoko Haram has been trying since 2009 to establish an Islamic state in northeast Nigeria, from where it has launched attacks and suicide bombings in Niger, Chad and Cameroon. Over 15,000 people have been killed and millions displaced. \nAn assault on the nearby town of Bosso in June 2016 killed 32 soldiers, prompting Chad to send 2,000 troops to help Niger counter the militants. \nThose troops were withdrawn in October last year, raising renewed concern about security in the Diffa region.
