Three other countries are candidates to host World Expo 2025: Japan (Osaka), Russia (Ekaterinburg) and Azerbaijan (Baku).\nWorld Expos take place every five years, draw tens of millions of visitors and last up to six months, the BIE said on its website. The next one is in Dubai in 2020.\nPhilippe’s letter said that the Expofrance 2025 committee was forecasting 35 to 40 million visitors, while the Milan World Expo in 2015 had had only 20 million visitors. He said the government could not jeopardise public finances by giving guarantees for the event.\nParis, which will host the 2023 Rugby World Cup and the 2024 Olympics, had hoped to focus the 2025 World Expo in the Saclay suburb south of the city, which is a centre for science and technology.\nReporting by Geert De Clercq and Julie Carriat; Editing by Elaine Hardcastle\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-21T19:59:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-21T20:17:34.012+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
