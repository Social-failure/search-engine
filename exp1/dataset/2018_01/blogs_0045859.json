The billionaire investor drew attention this month after writing a letter to fellow CEOs urging them to be more socially responsible. The letter, entitled \"A sense of purpose,\" said that, \"To prosper over time, every company must not only deliver financial performance, but also show how it makes a positive contribution to society.\"\nOn the panel, Fink went on to emphasize that despite record gains for those involved in the financial markets, too many ordinary people are not feeling those benefits and losing sight of a secure retirement. \"That creates an incredible amount of fear,\" he told the audience.\nHe also cited worsening class divides and a growing sense of displacement among older people, saying that while global growth and falling unemployment may help the young, \"It's not going to solve as much anger as we think.\"\nThe future, Fink stressed, is far less bright for those approaching retirement age who have not mobilized their savings.\n\"As much as 72 percent of all savings is sitting in bank accounts in Germany and France, missing one of the biggest market rallies ever,\" he reiterated. \"Why? They're frightened of the future.\"\nFink referred back to his letter, driving home his belief that companies working with communities and \"having a purpose that can connect with your employees, connect with your clients, those are going be the leading companies in the future.\"\nBlackRock is the world's largest asset management firm, with more than $6 trillion in assets under management.\nFollow CNBC International on Twitter and Facebook .", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-25T19:06:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-25T20:48:44.028+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
