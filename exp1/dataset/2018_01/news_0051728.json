The FPM and Berri’s Amal movement traded blame over the incident. \nBassil expressed regret for his remarks in an interview with al-Akhbar newspaper on Monday, but this did little to ease fury in the Berri camp, which said he had crossed “red lines”. \nPolitical tensions between Berri, a Shi‘ite, and Aoun, a Maronite Christian, have been escalating since December when Aoun signed a decree promoting dozens of army officers without the signature of Shi‘ite Finance Minister Ali Hassan Khalil, a member of Amal and one of his closest aides. \nBerri says Aoun exceeded his constitutional powers. Aoun says he did not. \nLebanon is due to hold a parliamentary election in May, its first since 2009.
