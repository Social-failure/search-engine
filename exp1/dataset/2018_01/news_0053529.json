The company said it lost 523 million NEM after the cyberattack, meaning the payments would amount to ¥46.3 billion. It said about 260,000 customers hold NEM. \nCoincheck didn’t say when customers would get the yen. It said it would use its own funds for the payments, but didn’t say whether it had that much yen cash on hand. \nThe rate being used by Coincheck reflects the fall in NEM’s price in yen after Coincheck’s problems became known on Friday. Some Twitter users criticized Coincheck’s rate, saying it should compensate customers at the earlier, higher rate or pay them back in NEM rather than in yen.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-28T06:02:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-28T06:09:23.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
