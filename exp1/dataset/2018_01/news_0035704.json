Its shares ultimately fell 80 percent and the company has been trying to raise new financing.\nNone of the recapitalisation strategies, including a buyout by the company’s former managing director, reached completion.\nBondholder Asia Pacific Investments DAC, connected with U.S. fund Davidson Kempner Capital Management, triggered a put option last Friday requiring Quintis to buy 400 hectares (988 acres) of plantations for about A$37 million by Feb. 2.\n“The Company does not have the financial resources available to it to pay the put option price,” Quintis said on Monday, announcing the appointment of insolvency firm KordaMentha as administrator.\nQuintis is one of the last remaining publicly listed managed investment schemes in Australia. It owns sandalwood plantations in northern Australia and oil from the trees is sold to India and China for fragrances, cosmetics and medicinal uses.\nIts slide into administration follows the collapse over the past eight years of Timbercorp Ltd and several other large forestry schemes, whose investment model was criticised for frequently involving small investors borrowing money for high-risk operations.\nSoren Aandahl, Head of Research at Glaucus, told Reuters by phone from California that the collapse “completely vindicates” Glaucus’ research. Details of the firm’s short position and its execution were confidential, he said.\n“It also highlights what we believe is the value of short-sellers in the financial markets,” Aandahl added.\nA Quintis spokesman declined to comment.\nKordaMentha plans to run the 20-year-old business as normal, while assessing how best to recover value for all its investors, a spokesman for the administrator said.\nQuintis shares last traded in May 2017, valuing the company at A$115 million. The stock is the 19th most-shorted Australian stock, according to the Australian Securities and Investment Commission, with 8.2 percent held by short-sellers as of last Monday.
