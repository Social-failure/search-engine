What they didn’t anticipate was the virulent and strident Remain, and some call it ultra-Remain, reaction to Brexit.”\nThis time, instead of sending people out onto the streets, Woolfe said the groups would produce policy papers detailing their vision for the future relationship with the EU, including on immigration and financial services.\n“ONE VOICE”\n“We will talk with one voice,” he said. “We have something that is mission critical, the next six weeks ... is really the time when most of the decisions will be made on our trade future.”\nThe referendum, in which 52 percent voted to leave the EU and 48 percent to remain, exposed deep geographic, social and economic divisions in Britain.\nWhile England and Wales voted to leave, Scotland and Northern Ireland backed remain. Many cities, including London, voted to remain, while voters supported Brexit in northern England, where many have been hurt by the demise of the coal and steel industries, and in coastal towns and villages.\nFor some of those who backed Brexit, talk of overturning the 2016 vote, holding a second referendum or even the Conservative government’s agreement to having a two-year transition period with the EU in which little changes, amounts to a betrayal.\nTo turn the tide, Woolfe and his supporters want to press what he calls his four freedoms - of Britain having control over all its laws, its finances, trade agreements and immigration.\n“If the final deal has a conclusion that means that those four key points are not in the control of the UK government ... it is an absolute betrayal of the people who voted to leave the European Union,” he said.\nReporting by Elizabeth Piper; Editing by Gareth Jones\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-01-25T07:20:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-26T21:25:10.004+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
