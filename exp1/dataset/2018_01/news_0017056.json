Based on preliminary evidence, including video footage, it is believed that the shooting was from within the group of protesters. The deceased was not employed by RBPlat,” the company said in a statement on Thursday.\nThe incident took place on Wednesday night and a company spokeswoman said operations were continuing at the mine.
