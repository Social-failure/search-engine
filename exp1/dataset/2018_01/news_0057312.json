The 2017 figure increased 8.56 percent when compared to 2016.\nAnalysts expect the financial hub’s property prices to lift a further 5 to 20 percent in 2018 partly due to high liquidity and a severe supply-demand imbalance.\nThe Asian financial hub has one of the most expensive property markets in the world, with the average cost per square foot of an apartment about HK$12,100 ($1,547.31), according to property agency Midland Realty. On the prime Hong Kong Island, the average cost is about HK$16,200 per square foot.\nHigh property costs have spurred political discontent in the city and pushed more people into semi-illegal partitioned flats or onto the streets.\nReporting by Venus Wu; Editing by Sam Holmes\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-31T06:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-31T06:33:57.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
