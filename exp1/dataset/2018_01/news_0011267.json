(Reuters) - The March revival of hit 1990s television comedy “Roseanne” will show how a politically divided, working-class American family grapples with daily life and challenges after the election of U.S. President Donald Trump, the show’s stars said on Monday. \nWalt Disney Co’s ABC broadcast network is bringing back “Roseanne,” starring Roseanne Barr and John Goodman, for nine episodes starting March 27. \nIn the new episodes, the titular Roseanne, played by Barr, is now a grandmother who voted for Trump and at times clashes with family members and friends with opposing views, the show’s cast and producers said at a Television Critics Association event. \nThe original “Roseanne” aired from 1988 to 1997 and was the most-watched show on U.S. television in 1989 and 1990. It featured a blue-collar family, the Conners, with overweight parents struggling to get by in the fictional town of Lanford, Illinois. \nThe series was praised for its realistic portrayal of a working-class family in the United States, and Barr said she wanted the revival to also present a true-to-life portrait of a country in which half the voters chose Trump. \n“It was the working-class people who elected Trump,” Barr said. “I felt that was very real and something that needed to be discussed.” \nBarr herself has spoken in support of Trump, but the show’s producers said the series does not advocate a political stance. 75th Golden Globe Awards – Arrivals – Beverly Hills, California, U.S., 07/01/2018 – John Goodman.
