REUTERS/Thomas Peter \n”I think obviously it’s pretty easy to think, ‘Why me?'“ Kyrgios said of the odd incidents. ”The guy in the crowd was crazy. I didn’t really know what was going on. \n“The helicopter, that’s when I was thinking like, of course, it’s at my match. It’s just hovering there. Of course, it is.” \n“Hearing the ball actually come off the racket is a pretty big thing. I missed four returns. I‘m blaming the helicopter.” Slideshow (5 Images) \nTold that the fan had posted his puerile stunt on social media, Kyrgios, who was fined for swearing at a fan on Monday, said: “Good on him. Little claim to fame. Let him have it.” \nKyrgios got a helping hand at 5-5 when Troicki served two consecutive double faults to go 0-40 down and he rifled away a backhand winner after a ferocious baseline exchange. \nTwo unforced errors from Troicki gifted Kyrgios a break at the start of the second set and he then dipped into his bag of dinks and chips and slapped winners to take a two-set lead. Related Coverage \nKyrgios broke in the third game of the third set but nothing is ever routine with him and out of nowhere, he was broken himself when serving for the match at 5-4. \n“I started freaking out a little bit,” Kyrgios said. \nTroicki saved one match point at 1-6 in the tiebreak with a deft volley but Kyrgios struck a backhand into the corner a point later to complete a good night’s work and supply further evidence that he is harnessing his unique talent. \n“I think last year, the year before, I probably would have been probably still out on the court right now, could be losing that match,” Kyrgios said.
