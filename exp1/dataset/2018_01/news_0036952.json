Haruhiko Kuroda Tuesday continued his efforts to cool recent speculation that the bank will raise rates this year. Bond yields in the U.S. fell after the Japanese central bank signaled it isn’t ready to join a global wave of unwinding led by the Federal Reserve. BOJ policies currently range from negative interest rates to purchasing the country’s government bonds.\nThe decline in bond yields “doesn’t help the dollar,” said Brian Daingerfield, a strategist at NatWest Markets.\nWhile economic data in the U.S. continues to show signs of solid growth, the broad context that has been driving the value of the dollar has been to view the U.S. expansion as fueling world-wide consumption and activity, Mr. Daingerfield said. “People are looking at the impact of more U.S. growth on the global economy” rather than what it means for the Fed’s cycle of rate increases, he said.\nThat sentiment reflects a forecast by the International Monetary Fund released Monday that predicts global economic growth will reach an inflation-adjusted 3.9% this year and in 2019. The expansion, which would be the strongest since 2011, is in large part attributable to the tax cut package passed by Congress in December, the IMF found.\nWrite to Daniel Kruger at Daniel.Kruger@wsj.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-23T20:19:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-23T23:00:06.001+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
