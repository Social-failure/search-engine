But it lasted less than a minute when Allen answered with a triple of his own.\nCincy took the lead for good when guard Cane Broome’s 3-pointer at the 12:47 mark broke a 30-30 tie. That basket also sparked an 8-0 run that put the Bearcats up 38-30 with just over eight minutes remaining.\nUCF cut that in half on Fall’s two short shots, but the Bearcats responded and Clark’s dunk with 3:56 remaining put them up 45-36, their biggest margin of the game to that point.\nThe first half featured many empty possessions for both teams.\nHalfway through the period the Bearcats had made only 2 of their 11 field-goal attempts but trailed only 14-5 because the Knights had hit only 5 of their 18 attempts.\nClark then scored five quick points on a layup and 3-pointer and guard Jarron Cumberland hit a triple to get the Bearcats to within 14-13, but Taylor closed out the half with a couple of baskets and Griffin added a free throw to make it a 19-15 game at the intermission.\nThe point totals were also season-lows for the first half for both teams.\n--Field Level Media\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-01-17T10:27:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-17T20:10:47.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
