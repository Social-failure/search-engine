On Wednesday, the Chilean government raised its forecast for the average 2018 price for copper, the nation's most important export by far, to $3.06 from $2.95 previously. Chile's blue-chip IPSA index ended the day up 0.92 percent after reaching an all-time high of 5,845.72 points. Shares in Copec, which owns forestry company Arauco, gained the most, up 3.11 percent, to close at their highest ever level. The stock was boosted by news that leading Brazilian pulpmaker Fibria Celulose SA would hike its pulp prices. Shares in Copec's holding company, AntarChile, rose 2.95 percent. Argentina's smaller Merval index also hit an all-time high after a Tuesday decision by the central bank to cut the interest rate on its Lebac securities. Argentina's stock market has benefited in recent months from foreign capital inflows, as high liquidity abroad combines with a favorable political outlook for the nation.
