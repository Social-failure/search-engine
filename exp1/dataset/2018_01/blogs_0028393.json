This is a great outcome for our shareholders, employees and customers,\" an Uber spokesperson said in a statement.\nKalanick , who was ousted as CEO last year after high-profile problems, will get $1.4 billion from the deal , a source familiar with the arrangement has told CNBC. His estimated fortune is $4.74 billion , according to Bloomberg.\nUber previously said the SoftBank deal would value the company at about $48 billion, a haircut from its previous valuation of nearly $70 billion. But the investment also provides liquidity for early employees, easing tension as the ride-hailing company aims for a 2019 public offering.\nSoftBank has become an aggressive investor in Silicon Valley, and enters Uber's board as the company recovers from a massive data breach, regulatory scrutiny and a damaging workplace culture report.\nThe governance changes that accompany the deal also mark a milestone for CEO Dara Khosrowshahi , who has now successfully consolidated power at a company that was rife with infighting when he arrived.\nSoftBank is an investor in Didi Chuxing, the majority owner of Uber's China operations, and has backed Grab, a ride-hailing company in Southeast Asia, as well as India's Ola.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-18T17:49:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-18T18:10:22.018+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
