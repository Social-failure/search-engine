It said that all the children were transported to Marib province in northern Yemen, which is under Yemeni government control. \nHuman Rights Watch had said in past reports that both sides of the Yemen conflict have deployed child soldiers. \nA coalition of Arab countries led by Saudi Arabia intervened in the Yemen conflict in March 2015 when the Houthis advanced on the southern port city of Aden and forced Hadi and his government into exile in Saudi Arabia.
