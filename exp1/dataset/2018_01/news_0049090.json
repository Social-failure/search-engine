His administration has also pulled out of a Pacific trade deal and is looking to renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement.\nEU chief spokesman Margaritis Schinas retorted Monday that \"the EU stands ready to react swiftly and appropriately in case our exports are affected by any restrictive trade measure from the United States.\"\nSchinas said that \"while trade has to be open and fair it also has to be rules-based.\"\nThe issues also came to the fore during last week's World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland.\nIn 2016, official figures show, the EU imported 246 billion euros ($304 billion) in goods from the U.S. while exporting some 362 billion euros ($448 billion) to the country. Trump has taken aim at that U.S. deficit of 116 billion euros ($143 billion). In services, the U.S. deficit is much smaller, of only about 13 billion euros ($16 billion).\nThe EU and Germany both called for cooperation Monday.\nGerman government spokesman, Steffen Seibert, noted that Chancellor Angela Merkel set out in Davos last week why her government wants \"an even stronger, more competitive, more self-confident EU that takes over even more international responsibility.\"\n\"But that is not directed against anyone, including the United States of America,\" Seibert told reporters in Berlin. \"We try for solutions, strive for cooperation that is advantageous for both partners.\"\nGeir Moulson in Berlin contributed to this report.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-29T13:33:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-29T19:26:41.019+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
