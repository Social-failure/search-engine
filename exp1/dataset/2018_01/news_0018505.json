Next, use one simple trick to save tens of thousands of dollars on your mortgage: Switch to a bi-weekly payment plan.\nThat means, \"instead of paying your mortgage once a month, you actually set it up with your bank and pay half a mortgage payment every two weeks.\"\nSo if your mortgage payment is $1,000 a month, you will pay $500 every two weeks. Since you're making payments every other week, rather than once a month, you'll end up making one extra payment a year.\nshow chapters Real estate moguls Sean Conlon and Sidney Torres agree: There is a right amount for a down payment 1:16 PM ET Tue, 27 June 2017 | 01:03 By paying half of your monthly payment every two weeks, over the course of a year, you will make 26 half-payments. That's the same as 13 full payments, or one more payment than there are months in a year.\nMaking more payments means paying your mortgage off sooner, which means paying less in interest. It depends on your interest rate, but \"on an average mortgage in America, you'll save over $44,000 in interest payments,\" Bach tells CNBC Make It.\nTo see just how much you can save by using a bi-weekly plan, plug in your own numbers on Bankrate's mortgage payment calculator .\nYou may have to pay a one-time set-up fee to switch payment plans, but \"many banks offer it for no extra cost,\" notes Bach.\nLike this story?
