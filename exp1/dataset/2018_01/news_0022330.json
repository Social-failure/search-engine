King will continue as a non-executive director of Rothesay Life. \nKheraj, who has been on the board of Rothesay Life since 2014, was also finance director of Barclays prior to JP Morgan Cazenove. \nRothesay Life is backed by private equity investor Blackstone, US insurer MassMutual and Singapore sovereign wealth fund GIC. \nIt has also made Stan Beckers, ex-CEO of NN Investment Partners, and Terry Miller directors, replacing Glenn Earle and Dermot McDonogh. Miller is a non-executive director of Goldman Sachs International Bank, where he was previously international general counsel.
