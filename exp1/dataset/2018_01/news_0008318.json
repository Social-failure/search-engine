And not only for the beef market, but also for pork,” Maggi told the broadcaster.\nJapan, for example, does not buy meat from Brazil and the United States will not allow meat with the bone, due to risk of the disease, he said.\nReporting by Jake Spring; Editing by Matthew Lewis\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-05T21:48:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-05T21:57:04.014+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
