REUTERS/Alessandro Bianchi WAVE OF ARRIVALS Chile has had much less immigration than other South American nations, but a stable economy and moderate politics since the end of the Pinochet dictatorship in 1990 have made it more attractive to those fleeing economic hardship elsewhere in Latin America.\nA wave of recent arrivals from Haiti and Venezuela has increasingly stoked anti-immigrant sentiment in Chile.\nSlideshow (3 Images) The region around Iquique, which means “dreams,” in the local indigenous Aymara language, has the country’s highest percentage of migrants, according to official statistics.\nPeople from neighboring Peru, Argentina, Ecuador and Bolivia have been attracted to Chile’s northern desert region, home to the majority of mines and a booming service and construction industry in the world’s biggest copper exporter.\nBut many who arrive seeking their fortunes have instead found poverty and exclusion.\n“There are many immigrants here who don’t have work, who live with very little, in rooms like animals,” said Dora Reyes, a Peruvian shopkeeper who moved to Chile two decades ago. “There is still a lot of racism and inequality.”\nAlthough immigration remains proportionally low compared with most developed countries, it has grown fivefold over the last 30 years, statistics from the government’s immigration service show.\nArrivals from Haiti surged 144 percent in 2015, while those from recession-hit Venezuela soared 192 percent.\nAdditional reporting by Dave Sherwood; Editing by Lisa Von Ahn\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-18T19:05:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-18T19:18:42.018+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
