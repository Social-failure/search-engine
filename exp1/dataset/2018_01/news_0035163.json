It is the top trading partner of many countries in the region, including Brazil, Chile and Argentina.\nIn recent years, Chinese companies have moved away from merely buying Latin American raw materials and are diversifying into sectors like auto manufacturing, e-commerce and even technology businesses like car-hailing services.\nChile, one of the most open economies in Latin America, updated its bilateral trade deal with China in November 2017 on the sidelines of an Asia-Pacific economic summit.\n“Like Chile, China rejects protectionism in favor of openness, connectivity, investment, trade and cooperation,” Munoz said.\nWriting by Caroline Stauffer; Editing by Paul Simao\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-01-22T07:46:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-22T05:57:05.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
