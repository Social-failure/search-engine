In a statement, Bank of New York Mellon said has not yet received formal communication about the federal prosecutors’ action involving the bank. \nPostalis is suing the bank. \n“We believe the federal prosecutors’ accusations repeat unfounded accusations in those lawsuits,” the Brazilian unit of BNY Mellon said in a statement. \n“Federal prosecutors suggest fiduciary managers are responsible for investment decisions, which is not true,” the statement added.
