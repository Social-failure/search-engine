On Wednesday, bitcoin was trading at $14,676, according to prices compiled by the Luxembourg-based Bitstamp exchange.\nThe emerging asset class has created a divide among Wall Street and central bankers alike over whether it is a legitimate and sustainable financial instrument.\nThe SEC and the CFTC have been increasing their jurisdiction over the cryptocurrency market, which has no overriding U.S. federal regulator. Both watchdogs have warned of the considerable risks posed by the volatile currency and have said they may not be able to protect investors from cryptocurrency fraudsters.\nThe CFTC last month allowed CME Group Inc ( CME.O ) and CBOE Global Markets Inc ( CBOE.O ) to list bitcoin futures contracts, but this month said it would review its process for listing digital currency futures following criticism from market participants.\nFive fund managers this week shelved plans to launch exchange-traded funds based on bitcoin futures, citing concerns from the SEC regarding the liquidity of the underlying futures market.\nReporting by Michelle Price; Editing by Leslie Adler; Editing by Sandra Maler and Leslie Adler\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-11T02:47:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-11T03:10:31.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
