Iranian forces, Hezbollah and other Shi‘ite Muslim militias also back Assad.\nIsrael fears Iran could be left with a permanent garrison in Syria, extending a threat posed from neighboring Lebanon by Hezbollah, which has an extensive missile arsenal and last fought a war with the Israeli military in 2006.\nNetanyahu said he also planned to discuss with Putin “Iran’s effort to turn Lebanon into one giant missile site, a site for precision missiles against the State of Israel, which we will not tolerate”.\nReporting by Jeffrey Heller; Editing by Janet Lawrence\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-29T12:15:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-29T12:29:33.002+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
