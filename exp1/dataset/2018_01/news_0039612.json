The force of the explosion caused three people to lose their lives,” said ISOC spokesman Pramote Prom-in. The ISOC is a government security force that operates in the region. \nNo group claimed immediate responsibility for the attack on Monday, which took place at a morning market. \nPolice said the motorcycle was placed near a stall selling pork, which is strictly forbidden for Muslims under Islamic Law. \nIt was not immediately clear whether the bomb was placed at the pork stall in a deliberate attempt to target Thai Buddhists. \nThe stall’s female owner and a male customer were among the three people killed, police said. The bomb blew off chunks of the market’s corrugated tin roof and wrecked nearby stalls. \nThe southern provinces have seen hundreds of attacks since 2004, many of them deadly, but there had been fewer violent incidents of late. \nAnalysts who monitor the conflict say violence from the insurgency fell to an historic low in 2017 despite the fact that talks aimed at bringing peace gained little traction. \nThailand’s military government has tried to revive talks with rebel groups initiated by the previous civilian government, but they have gone almost nowhere. \nResistance to Buddhist rule from Bangkok has existed for decades in the predominantly Muslim southern provinces, waning briefly in the 1990s before resurfacing violently in 2004.
