Two 18-year-olds who set fire to only one portrait were jailed for three years and four months each. \nThe lawyer said police arrested two men in December over allegations that they paid his clients to set fire to the portraits, but the two have not yet been prosecuted. \nThailand’s military, which took control of the government in a May 2014 coup, has said it needs to crack down on critics of the monarchy for the sake of national security. \nSince the coup, at least 94 people have been prosecuted for lese majeste. As many as 43 people have been sentenced, says the iLaw group that monitors royal insult case, with 92 percent pleading guilty in hopes of shorter jail terms. \nThe laws protecting members of the royal family from insult limit what all news organizations, including Reuters, can report from Thailand. \nThe United Nations has expressed concern over what it calls a deteriorating rights situation in Thailand, including harsh sentences for those convicted of violating the lese-majeste law, known as Article 112.
