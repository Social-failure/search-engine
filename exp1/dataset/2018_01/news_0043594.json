But even such comments probably won’t be enough to halt ongoing dollar weakness,” Ishizuki at Daiwa Securities said.\nThe Australian dollar traded at $0.8054 advanced to a four-month high of $0.8086.\nThe Canadian dollar reached C$1.2316 per dollar, its strongest since late September.\nA rally in crude oil prices has given an extra lift to commodity-linked currencies like the Australian and Canadian dollars.\nThe New Zealand dollar was 0.55 percent higher at $0.7381 , but off a five-month peak of $0.7437 after data showed the country’s consumer prices rose at a slower-than-expected pace in the fourth quarter.\nUpbeat UK employment data, on the other hand, helped lift the pound to $1.4275, a fresh 1-1/2-year top.\nReporting by Shinichi Saoshiro; Editing by Shri Navaratnam\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-01-25T11:24:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-25T13:03:38.016+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
