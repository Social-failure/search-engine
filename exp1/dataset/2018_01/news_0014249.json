It earlier matched the overnight high of 2.555 percent, its highest since March.\n“The BOJ’s move reminded traders of the fact that major central banks are willing to normalize their monetary policy,” said Masafumi Yamamoto, chief currency strategist at Mizuho Securities.\n“I think this unwanted strengthening of the yen will make the BOJ more cautious in going forward, when they want to move toward normalization,” he said.\nThe dollar index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six major rival currencies, inched down 0.1 percent to 92.473.\nThe euro was steady on the day at $1.1937, well below its nearly four-month high of $1.2089 set last Thursday.\nSterling was slightly lower at $1.3534, but remained supported by expectations that Brexit talks will have a positive outcome.\nReporting by Lisa Twaronite; editing by Simon Cameron-Moore\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-01-10T13:06:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-11T12:40:48.011+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
