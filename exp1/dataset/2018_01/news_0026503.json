There is a large gap between what is being reported, and the potential number of victims out there,” she told the Thomson Reuters Foundation by phone.\nAt least 13,000 people across Britain are estimated by the government to be victims of modern slavery - trapped in forced labor, sexual exploitation and domestic servitude - but police say the true figure is likely to be in the tens of thousands.\nPolice in Britain are ramping up investigations into cases of slavery and trafficking, with more than 500 live policing operations into the crimes ongoing, according to the NCA - dubbed Britain’s FBI.\nBut watchdogs say Britain’s failure to grasp the scale of slavery and mediocre police investigations are hindering efforts to tackle the crime, and ensure quality support for victims.\n“Until the UK has a joined-up strategy and coordinated data capture and analysis, it will always be several steps behind the perpetrators in confronting this crime,” said the head of the British anti-human-trafficking charity Unseen, Andrew Wallis.\nThe NCA’s data and analysis is based upon the potential victims of slavery who come forward to seek support from the government, with more than 7,000 cases recorded since 2015.\nCombining these NCA statistics with demographic data on education, ethnicity and birthplace, UK-based Verisk Maplecroft found that people living in cities, immigrants and those lacking qualifications were most threatened by slavery and trafficking.\nThe NCA said it was gaining a better understanding of modern slavery and gathering more evidence and intelligence with operations on the rise.\n“While there are regional variations ... it is clear that modern slavery is a crime that affects all types of communities across every part of the UK,” a spokesman said.\nReporting By Kieran Guilbert, Editing by Katy Migiro.
