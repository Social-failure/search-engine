Correa says such efforts constitute a “coup” by Moreno.\nA team of economists, lawyers and businessmen will analyze debt operations carried out between January 2012 and May 2017 and will present recommendations in April.\nComptroller Pablo Celi said Correa and former Finance Ministry officials had been notified about investigation.\nShortly after taking office last May, Moreno said that total public debt was $42 billion dollars, plus additional liabilities including some associated with payments to oil services companies.\nI have just learned of a supposed preliminary report on the audit of the debt and a commission that includes several haters of the (Citizen’s Revolution),” Correa said via Twitter, referring to his political movement.\nDuring a later speech in the city of Guayaquil he described the probe as “persecution.”\nThe former president is leading a campaign for the “No” vote in a Feb. 4 referendum on constitutional reforms include a measure to prohibit indefinite re-election, a measure Correa created that allowed him to run for a second term.\nCorrea himself in 2008 commissioned a team of experts to study the country’s prior debt operations. The experts concluded that several debt operations were “illegitimate,” leading his government to declare a default.\nReporting by Alexandra Valencia, writing by Brian Ellsworth\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-01-09T08:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-09T17:04:31.004+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
