(323 sq feet) or less.\n“If establishments with a floor space of 150 square meters or less are exempt from the smoking ban, about 90 percent of bars will escape the restrictions,” said Yumiko Mochizuki, a doctor and member of the Japan Cancer Society.\n“If things stay this way, the Olympic Games in 2020 will be held in an extremely smoky environment.”\nHealth ministry officials were not immediately available for comment.\nJapan ranks at the bottom globally in anti-smoking measures, going by the types of public spaces that are entirely smoke-free, says the World Health Organization, which has teamed with global Olympics officials to ensure smoke-free Games venues.\nAhead of the 2020 Olympics, the International Olympics Committee (IOC) is among those pressuring the Japanese capital to follow Rio de Janeiro and other recent games hosts in banning smoking in all public areas.\nAsked how smoking restrictions at the 2020 Olympics would compare with previous Olympics, Toshiharu Furukawa, a ruling party lawmaker who is a medical doctor, said, “It would look considerably less favorable.”\nIn contrast, Tomoyuki Utsuno, an official of an industry grouping of about 10,000 small bar and restaurant operators in Tokyo, welcomed the latest development.\n“This is one step forward,” Utsuno said. “Our activities, such as collecting signatures, are bearing fruit,” he added, referring to those who oppose tough measures against smoking.\nReporting by Ami Miyazaki and Kiyoshi Takenaka; Editing by Clarence Fernandez\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-31T15:10:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-31T15:49:47.001+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
