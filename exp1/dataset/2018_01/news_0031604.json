The order allows prosecutors to freeze assets pending the outcome of an investigation.\nA spokesman for McKinsey said on Monday it had not received formal communication about the preservation order.\n“As we have said before ... we will return the fee we earned from the Eskom turnaround programme (R1.028bn) no matter what,” the spokesman said in an email to Reuters.\nMcKinsey will cooperate with South African authorities in their investigations into the case, he added.\nMcKinsey launched its own investigation into its handling of the partnership with Trillian and says it ceased work with the firm in March 2016 after due diligence showed links to the Gupta brothers.\nTrillian did not respond to a request for comment from Reuters on Monday. When contacted in November by Reuters, Trillian denied wrongdoing relating to the Eskom contract.\nBoth Zuma and the Guptas deny wrongdoing. Zuma’s spokesman did not reply to a Reuters request for comment.\nThe court decision is one of the first instances in which authorities have acted on allegations of wrongdoing by three Gupta brothers, Ajay, Atul and Rajesh, who South Africa’s anti-corruption watchdog accuses of siphoning off public funds.\nDeputy President Cyril Ramaphosa was elected last month to replace Zuma as leader of the ruling African National Congress, putting him in pole position to become South Africa’s next president.\nHe ran on a pledge to root out cases of corruption in government and on Saturday he said the judicial enquiry which Zuma agreed to set up should be given top priority.\n$1 = 12.3221 rand Editing by Matthew Mpoke Bigg\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-01-16T15:12:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-17T19:50:51.022+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
