That was down from an original layoff plan of 2,510 people announced in December. \nBankia shares were down by 0.1 percent, or 0.005 euros, at 1120 GMT while the Ibex rose 0.22 percent. $1 = 0.8027 euros Reporting by Jesús Aguado; Editing by Paul Day and Mark Potter", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-26T13:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-26T13:59:56.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
