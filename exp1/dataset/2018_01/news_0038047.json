The sale attracted many buyers, including private equity firms and financial services companies. \nThe sale of Prudential Vietnam Finance, which offers personal and mortgage loans, marks the British insurer’s first major asset divestment since it named its former group CFO, Nic Nicandrou, as the head of its Asia business in July last year. \nThe move comes as some global insurers are selling smaller and non-core units in Asia to sharpen focus on their main insurance businesses in a region, which is attractive due to low insurance penetration but is also hyper competitive. \n“PVFC is a high-quality business, but not core to our strategy in Vietnam,” Nicandrou said in the company statement, referring to the consumer finance unit in the Southeast Asian country. \n“Vietnam remains an attractive and important market to Prudential where we have high-quality and fast-growing life insurance and asset management operations.” \nUnder the terms of the transaction, Prudential and Shinhan, a diversified financial group with interest in banking and insurance, have also agreed to a new long-term bancassurance partnership in Vietnam and Indonesia, the British insurer said.
