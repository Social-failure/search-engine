This may be required for Ryanair’s three UK domestic routes in the event of a hard Brexit in March 2019,” the airline said in a statement.\nRyanair said last year that it planned to pivot its growth away from Britain over the next two years as it fears the lack of clarity over Brexit will cause major travel disruption and hit demand.\nThe Dublin-based airline’s three intra-UK routes only account for around 2 percent of its business.\nReporting by Padraic Halpin; Editing by Adrian Croft\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-01-03T00:32:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-03T06:28:07.002+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
