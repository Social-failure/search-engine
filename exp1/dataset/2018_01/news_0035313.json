U.S., Canadian and Mexican negotiators opened a key week-long round of talks to modernize NAFTA on Tuesday.\nJapanese Economy Minister Toshimitsu Motegi said the new Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP), or TPP-11, would be an “engine to overcome protectionism” emerging in parts of the world.\nHe added Japan would explain the importance of the deal to Washington in hopes of persuading it to join.\nMinisters from the 11 countries, including Japan, Australia and Canada, agreed in November on core elements to move ahead without the United States, but demands by countries including Canada for measures to ensure the deal protects jobs blocked a final agreement.\n“This outcome reaffirms the CPTPP countries’ collective commitment towards greater trade liberalization and regional integration,” Singapore’s Ministry of Trade and Industry said in a statement.\nAustralian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull said last week the new agreement would leave a door open for eventual U.S. participation.\nCanada, which wanted protection of its cultural industries, and Vietnam, which has worried about labor protection rules, will exchange separate side letters with other members on those topics at the time of the signing, Motegi said.\nAdditional reporting by Jack Kim in Singapore, David Ljunggren in Montreal and Leah Schnurr in Ottawa; Writing by Linda Sieg; Editing by Steve Orlofsky and James Dalgleish\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-01-23T17:08:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-23T20:49:15.013+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
