Reach her on Messenger to share your thoughts on market moves: helen.reid.thomsonreuters.com@reuters.net RESULTS WATCH: SIEMENS STRUGGLES, ARCELORMITTAL RESUMES DIVIDENDS (0641 GMT) Results are rolling in thick and fast today from industrials as well as several banks. German engineering group Siemens reports a fall in quarterly industrial profit due to continued weak demand from the power and gas sector. Profit was in line with analysts' forecasts, but profit margin shrank. Interestingly the group says it got a net 437 million euro benefit from U.S. tax reforms in the first quarter. The world's largest producer of steel, ArcelorMittal, was more upbeat, with profit ahead of expectations and resuming dividend payments after skipping them for 2015 and 2016. The $0.10 payout undershoots analysts' expectations of $0.30, though. A slew of banks reporting today as well, with ING's Q4 profit missing expectations while Sweden's SEB raises its dividend after strong results. Meanwhile impairments in its U.S. unit dented Santander's numbers. The pressure's on for European banks, a leading sector in this year's rally, to deliver convincing results, so it'll be interesting to see how banking shares react today. Also in results to watch today, especially considering the tech rally after AMS results earlier this week, will be chipmaker Infineon. More on that soon.
