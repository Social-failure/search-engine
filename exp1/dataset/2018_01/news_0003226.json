The rankings are based on the industry data reported by Pensions & Investments as of 03/31/2017. The rankings are based on the worldwide assets under management in investment outsourcing programs reported by each advisor who supplied data to Pensions & Investments. As of 3/31/2017, Aon's global asset under management was approximately $102.9 billion. Assets under management is calculated based on assets in which Aon has full discretion. The survey does not report on any undisclosed facts about any of the advisors who participated in the survey that could call into question the validity of the underlying data. The survey does not state or imply that the rankings represent the quality of advice provided by any advisor who participated in the survey. The survey discloses the complete list of advisors who participated in the survey. The data may not represent any one client's experience because the data reflects the cumulative asset growth across the entire sampling of the clients of each advisor who participated in the survey. The data is not indicative of the future performance of advisors who participated in the survey. The survey was conducted by Pensions & Investments. No advisor paid a fee to participate in the survey.\n3 As of June 30, 2017, Townsend had assets under management of approximately $14.8 billion. When calculating assets under management, Townsend aggregates net asset values and unfunded commitments on a quarterly basis. Townsend relies on third parties to provide asset valuations, which typically takes in excess of 90 days after the quarter end. Therefore, assets under management have been calculated using June 30, 2017 figures where available but may also include March 31, 2017 figures. Assets under management are calculated quarterly. Regulatory AUM is calculated annually and available in our ADV or upon request.\n4 As of June 30, 2017, Townsend provided advisory services to clients who had real estate allocations of approximately $167.1 billion. Advised assets includes real estate allocations as reported by clients for whom Townsend provides multiple advisory servicesâ€”including strategic and underwriting advice for the entire portfolio. Advised assets are based on totals reported by each client to Townsend or derived from publicly available information. Advised assets are calculated quarterly. Select clients report less frequently than quarterly in which case Townsend rolls forward prior quarter totals. The recent change in Advised Assets is due to a change in the reporting of certain special projects.\n5 As of June 30, 2017, AHIC (U.S. only advised real estate assets) provided non-discretionary advisory services to clients who had $76.3 billion in real estate allocations.
