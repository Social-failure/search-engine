He left in a black car without talking to reporters.\n“I warmly welcome the joint proposals by the governments of the ROK (Republic of Korea) and DPRK (Democratic People’s Republic of Korea), which have been applauded by so many other governments worldwide,” said Bach in the statement.\n“This is a great step forward in the Olympic spirit ... now the IOC must take the decisions to make this political commitment a reality.”\nKim and U.S. President Donald Trump have exchanged fiery barbs in the past year and Trump has warned that the United States would have no choice but to “totally destroy” North Korea if forced to defend itself or its allies.\nBut the White House said on Wednesday that Trump told Moon Jae-in, the leader of South Korea, that the United States was open to talks with North Korea “at the appropriate time, under the right circumstances”.\nOn Monday, the IOC extended the deadline for the registration of North Korean athletes for the games.\nOnly a figure skating pair from North Korea has secured a spot although several other athletes could qualify through special places offered by the Olympic body.\nAdditional reporting by Brenna Hughes Neghaiwi; Writing by Brian Homewood; Editing by Alison Williams\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-10T17:50:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-10T18:07:30.025+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
