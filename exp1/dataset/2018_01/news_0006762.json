He finished 2017 with a 30-13 win-loss record. \n“I am very excited and looking forward to getting back on the court in January,” Nishikori said in a statement. \n“The Oracle Challenger Series is a perfect event in a great Southern California location to help me get some match play. This will be a great opportunity to face some high-level competition.” \nNishikori, currently ranked 22 in the world, also plans to compete at the Challenger event in Dallas, Texas, which begins on Jan. 29.
