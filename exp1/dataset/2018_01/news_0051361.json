In 2017 the company told suppliers it ultimately wanted orders delivered on time 95% of the time or they would pay a fine. The company hoped to add $1 billion to revenue by improving product availability at stores. \nWal-Mart has been implementing that goal in phases. \nIt will now require large suppliers to deliver full orders within a specified delivery window 85% of the time or face a fine of 3% of the cost of goods. \nPreviously, large suppliers had to hit a 75% threshold to avoid fines. \nFor smaller suppliers the delivery threshold will move to 50%, up from 33%. The change will take effect in April, Bratspies told Reuters.
