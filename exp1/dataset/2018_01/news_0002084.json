REUTERS/Mal Langsdon Emergency services said the skier was killed when a tree fell on him.\nStorm Eleanor, with winds of more than 140 kph, also fanned least three forest fires in Corsica and forced officials to suspend ferry lines between the island and mainland France.\nOne of the fires surrounded a village of about 60 houses, emergency services said.\nHouseholds in the eastern regions of Alsace, Franche-Comte and Lorraine were among the worst hit by the power cuts, Enedis, a unit of state-controlled EDF, said. The area around Paris, northeastern Picardie and Champagne-Ardenne were also affected.\nThe storm initially cut power to 225,000 households. Many had their electricity restored during the day but around 35,000 were still waiting in the evening, Enedis said.\nWinter storm Carmen battered western France on Jan. 1, with some 40,000 households in the Brittany region temporarily losing power on Monday.\nReporting by Sarah White, Simon Carraud, Ingrid Melander; Editing by Alison Williams\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-04T05:04:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-04T05:22:25.011+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
