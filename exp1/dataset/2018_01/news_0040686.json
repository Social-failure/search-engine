Kroger is rolling out curbside pickup as one way to fend off Amazon.\nAlibaba has been making an aggressive push into working with U.S. and Canadian companies that could be interested in selling in China as well as rolling out its cloud services and payment products. The talks with Kroger were not CEO-level, said the person, describing Kroger as one of many U.S. companies holding initial discussions with the Chinese company.\nIn China, Alibaba’s Hema supermarket chain has become a test bed for the e-commerce firm’s move into traditional retail, where mobile phones are used to order, pay and get information about items.\nKroger, which wants to sell more general merchandise like Amazon and Walmart, could direct customers to the Alibaba site, where they could buy general merchandise, the New York Post reported, citing a source.\nReporting By Peter Henderson; Editing by Muralikumar Anantharaman\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-25T07:47:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-25T08:02:21.008+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
