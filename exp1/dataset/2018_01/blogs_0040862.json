The Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program protects immigrants brought to the U.S. illegally as children. Trump Schumer tweet \nTrump is expected to release his \" legislative framework \" on immigration issues Monday. \nThat framework will include securing the borders and providing a permanent solution on DACA, according to White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders. \nSanders did not use the word \"wall\" in describing the framework. NAFTA \nWhen it comes to NAFTA, Trump is also wrong, Fox said. \nTrump wants major changes to the trade agreement between the U.S., Mexico and Canada because, he said, the current agreement is unfair to the U.S. \nNegotiators opened a week-long round of talks on NAFTA on Tuesday. It's the sixth and penultimate round of talks, which are supposed to conclude by the end of March to avoid a clash with Mexico's general elections. \n\"We want to stay in NAFTA. We want an improved NAFTA. But if we are kicked out of it we have choices,\" Fox said, noting that the U.S. is only 20 percent of the world economy. \nHe said Mexico could turn to China, for one. \n\"I don't know why [Trump] has to sacrifice U.S. corporations, global corporations. I don't know why he has to sacrifice ... American people by not joining in. Trading is a win-win situation. Trading is a creator of wealth,\" said Fox. \n— Reuters contributed to this report.
