After being tackled, McCoy pounded the turf in frustration while being attended to by trainers. He was carted off the field and was in a walking boot and tears after the game.\nThe Bills, who on Sunday will be appearing in their first playoff game since January 2000, could be forced to rely heavily on Marcus Murphy and Mike Tolbert, who shared carries after McCoy went down.\n”Next man up. That’s what we’ve done all year,“ said McDermott. ”You never replace a player like LeSean.\n“I’ve got a lot of confidence in Mike Tolbert and Murph and whoever else we put in the backfield. They did a nice job this past weekend and I expect them to do the same moving forward.”\nReporting by Frank Pingue in Toronto, editing by Ed Osmond\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-03T20:24:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-04T00:13:34.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
