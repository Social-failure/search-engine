This main reason for the blockage was resolved,” Evrard told reporters. \nZodiac, which is in the midst of being taken over by France’s Safran after repeated delays and profit warnings, broadly addressed problems of quantity in the first half of 2017 and quality during the second half, he said. \nA separate backlog of about 30 undelivered A320neo-family jets, which have been parked in Toulouse and Hamburg waiting for engines, should be cleared by mid-year, he added. \nThe French engineer and former missile maker also hailed a provisional order for at least 20 A380 superjumbos by Emirates, handing a reprieve to the world’s largest airliner after poor sales. \nAirbus is expected to halve production of the double-deck plane to six a year as part of the deal, which Airbus hopes will set a floor production level that will allow it to shop for more sales. But many aerospace analysts question whether it will make money at that rate. \nAsked about the breakeven production level, Evrard said, “I won’t say it is 6 (a year). I don’t say it is profitable or not profitable, but consider it an efficient rate.” \nAirbus plans to produce 12 A380s this year and eight in 2019. The company has not yet formally decided to cut output below eight, he added. \nAirbus has made significant changes to the production line allowing it to cut A380 costs, including reducing factory space and fewer assembly stations, Evrard told journalists visiting a fuselage parts factory in western France. \nEvrard said Airbus was in no hurry to decide whether to bring production of nacelles for LEAP engines in-house, matching a previous decision to take over similar work carried out by Pratt & Whitney on its own engines. \nAirbus, which has been in talks with France’s Safran about reallocating the work for several months, nonetheless believes it has contractual freedom to act if it decides to go ahead with the possible transfer, he added. \nThe talks are seen as the latest example of manufacturers vying to take over high-value work carried out by suppliers in order to boost margins or get hold of specific technology.
