We here in the European Union believe that trade can be and should be win-win,” spokesman Margaritis Schinas said.\nPresident Donald Trump pauses as he talks to journalists who are members of the White house travel pool on board Air Force One during his flight to Palm Beach, Florida while over South Carolina, February 3, 2017.

The European Union stands ready to react swiftly and appropriately in case our exports are affected by any restrictive trade measures from the United States,” he said.\nWashington last week imposed tariffs of 20 percent on imported washing machines and of 30 percent on incoming solar cells and modules, among the first unilateral trade restrictions made by the administration as part of a broader protectionist agenda.\nChina and South Korea condemned the tariffs, with Seoul set to complain to the World Trade Organization (WTO).\nThe European Commission said then that it regretted the U.S. move, had serious doubts that it met WTO conditions and would analyze the impact on EU exports.\nReporting by Philip Blenkinsop, Editing by Angus MacSwan\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-01-29T20:23:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-29T15:00:29.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
