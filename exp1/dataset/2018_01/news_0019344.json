Miles misfired on a contested 3-pointer with 11 seconds to go and a chance to draw the Raptors even, after which Curry iced the Warriors’ second win in two nights to start a five-game trip with two free throws with 2.5 seconds left.\nDurant (three), Thompson (two) and Curry (two) combined for seven 3-pointers for the Warriors, who shot 58.0 percent overall en route to the 20th victory in their last 23 games.\nCurry shot 6-for-12 overall in his return from a two-game absence due to a sprained right ankle.\nDraymond Green added 14 points and eight assists for the Warriors, who swept their fourth straight season series from the Raptors.\nDeRozan shot 17-for-31 en route to his 42 points for the Raptors, who despite the loss set a franchise record for wins in the first half of a season (29).\nOG Anunoby had 17 points, Serge Ibaka 14, Fred VanVleet 13 and Jonas Valanciunas 12 to go with a team-high nine rebounds for the Raptors, who played a third straight game without Kyle Lowry, out with a bruised tailbone.\n--Field Level Media\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-01-14T11:47:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-14T20:25:31.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
