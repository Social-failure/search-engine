It is also testing sending text messages to customers when their orders are ready. \nThe company is also doubling down in the Chinese market - where the cafe culture is taking off - to offset stagnant sales in the United States. China same-store sales were up 6 percent and Starbucks said it is planning to more than triple its over 3,000-store network in the country within a decade. \nIt recently opened a massive, showcase Reserve Roastery in Shanghai. \n“Our U.S. Starbucks stores, on average, do about $32,000 a week. The Roastery in Shanghai after 8 weeks of operations is doing, on average, twice that, not each week but each day,” Howard Schultz, the company’s executive chairman said on a conference call on Thursday. \nSchultz stepped down as chief executive last year to focus on Starbucks’ premium business and the pressure is mounting on his successor Kevin Johnson to boost growth. \nSales at established Americas region cafes in the quarter to Dec. 31 were up just 2 percent, falling short of Street estimates of a 3.3 percent rise.
