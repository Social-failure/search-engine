U.S. energy companies added 12 oil rigs drilling for new production last week, taking the total to 759, General Electric Baker Hughes energy services firm said on Friday.\nU.S. production is already on par with top exporter and OPEC kingpin Saudi Arabia. Only Russia produces more, averaging 10.98 million bpd in 2017.\n(Reporting by Henning Gloystein; editing by Richard Pullin)", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-29T03:54:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-29T05:01:46.010+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
