These measures should not be considered a substitute for, or superior to, measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP and our calculations thereof may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies.\nOur estimate of Adjusted EBITDA cannot be reconciled to our Projected Net Income, the closest GAAP measure, without unreasonable efforts. This reconciliation would require estimating amounts that will ultimately be determined in the purchase price allocation, which has not yet been completed, such as depreciation and amortization expense and interest expense and other financing costs, net. A purchase price allocation requires allocating the purchase price to the acquired assets, including property, fixed assets and intangibles based on their estimated fair value as of the acquisition date. Our estimate of Adjusted EBITDA is based upon the prior twelve months financial statements of CHS Inc. related to the assets and the following key assumptions: (i) closing of the acquisition in the first quarter of 2018; and (ii) the operation of the 33 stores with forecasted Adjusted Gross Margin of approximately $25 to $27 million during a twelve month period.\nAdjusted Gross Margin is defined as (i) operating income (loss) plus operating expense (excluding depreciation), DD&A, impairment expense, inventory valuation adjustments (which adjusts for timing differences to reflect the economics of our inventory financing agreements, including lower of cost or net realizable value adjustments, the impact of the embedded derivative repurchase obligation, and purchase price allocation adjustments), and unrealized gains (losses) on derivatives or (ii) revenues less cost of revenues (excluding depreciation) less inventory valuation adjustments and unrealized gains (losses) on derivatives. We define cost of revenues (excluding depreciation) as the hydrocarbon-related costs of inventory sold, transportation costs of delivering product to customers, crude oil consumed in the refining process, costs to satisfy our RINS obligations and certain hydrocarbon fees, and taxes. Cost of revenues (excluding depreciation) also includes the unrealized gains (losses) on derivatives and inventory valuation adjustments that we exclude from Adjusted Gross Margin.\nFree Cash Flow is defined as cash provided by (used in) operations less capital expenditures. We believe Free Cash Flow is a useful supplemental financial measure to evaluate our ability to generate cash to repay our indebtedness or make discretionary investments. Free Cash Flow should be considered in addition to, rather than as a substitute for, net income as a measure of our financial performance and net cash provided by (used in) operations as a measure of our liquidity. Free Cash Flow presented by other companies may not be comparable to our presentation as other companies may define these terms differently.\nForward-Looking Statements\nThis press release includes certain \" \" within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, which are intended to qualify for the \"safe harbor\" from liability established by the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. All statements other than statements of historical fact, including, without limitation, statements with respect to the timing and completion of the CHS Inc. retail asset acquisition (the \" Acquisition \"), the anticipated synergies and other benefits of the Acquisition, the anticipated financial and operating results of the Acquisition and the effect on Par Pacific's cash flows and profitability (including Adjusted EBITDA, free cash flow and Adjusted earnings per share), and Par Pacific's plans for financing the proposed acquisition, the conditions to the closing of the Acquisition and the possibility that the Acquisition will not close, are .
