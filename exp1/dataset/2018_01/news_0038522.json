For Germany, we think it’s unlikely in the short term.”\nDelivery Hero, which listed on the Frankfurt stock exchange last year, is the world’s biggest food delivery platform but is battling for control of its home market with Takeaway.com and the fierce competition is weighing on profitability.\nDelivery Hero has a market capitalization of 6.1 billion euros ($7.47 billion), while Amsterdam-listed Takeaway.com has a market capitalization of 2 billion euros.\nDelivery Hero, in which South African e-commerce giant Naspers ( NPNJn.J ) is a big investor, last month made a placement of new shares as it sought to raise funds to expand through acquisitions.\nShares in Takeaway.com dipped earlier this month after it reported disappointing order growth in the fourth quarter. Delivery Hero reports 2017 figures on Feb. 7.\nTakeaway.com says meal orders at its German unit Lieferando have outstripped those of Delivery Hero’s top German brands Lieferheld and Pizza.de by 20 percent, however, Delivery Hero says it is still ahead.\n($1 = 0.8166 euros)\nReporting by Nadine Schimroszik; Writing by Emma Thomasson; Editing by Louise Heavens\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-22T10:40:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-22T11:04:24.008+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
