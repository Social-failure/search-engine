He hates spending on clothes and still hasn't touched a dime of his \"Tonight Show\" money. \n\"I'm not a big splurge guy,\" Leno tells CNBC Make It , partly because he had Depression-era parents: \"They just frightened me to death, saying, 'You gotta save every penny!'\" \nPerhaps that's why the self-made millionaire still uses coupons, even for fast food. show chapters 11:17 AM ET Wed, 14 Dec 2016 | 01:01 \n\"McDonald's sent me these Happy Meal coupons. A bunch of Happy Meal coupons,\" he recalls. \"So one day I'm in the McLaren and I'm going to McDonald's. I say, 'Give me two Happy Meals.' And I give them the [coupons]. And the guy says, 'Sir, we only allow one meal. One coupon per visit.' I say, 'OK, that's fine. I'll pay for it.'\" \nThe employee has him pull over to explain that they normally don't allow two coupons per visit but are willing to make an exception. \n\"So now I pull over in this McLaren and people are coming around and looking at the McLaren,\" Leno continues. \"Now I look like the cheapest guy in the world driving this multimillion-dollar McLaren and I'm trying to get a free hamburger.\" show chapters", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-19T23:12:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-19T23:56:54.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
