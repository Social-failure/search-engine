REUTERS/Susana Vera Briton Chris Froome, last year’s winner, will not defend his title. He was the first British rider to win the Vuelta and the first man to claim a Tour de France/Vuelta double in the same season since the Spanish race was moved to after the Tour.\nHowever, Froome had previously announced that he would attempt the Giro d‘Italia/Tour double this year, meaning it would be too demanding to race the Vuelta after two grand tours.\nThe Briton could be stripped of his Vuelta title if he cannot provide a satisfactory explanation of why a urine test he gave after Stage 18 on Sept. 7 showed excessive levels of an asthma medication called Salbutamol. [nL3N1OD2VD]\nThe 32-year-old Froome, who rides for Team Sky, said he had done nothing wrong and would provide “whatever information” world cycling’s governing UCI requires.\nSalbutamol is permitted as a legal asthma drug by the World Anti-Doping Agency, and the UCI said Froome’s failed urine test did not necessitate a mandatory provisional suspension.\nReporting by Julien Pretot in Paris; Editing by Ken Ferris\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-13T17:43:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-13T17:54:07.067+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
