The murderer was seized. It was unfortunate and unexpected. An investigation goes on,” marine officer Ahmed Ali told Reuters. \nMogadishu resident Nur Mohamed told Reuters the colonel fired several shots from his pistol and hit the general in the head. \n“I was chatting with the general shortly before he was killed .... I heard the gunshots and when I ran to the scene I was shocked to see the general lying on the ground, bleeding,” he said, adding that Yusuf died on the scene from bullet wounds. \nMarine officer Ahmed Ali said the colonel was arrested. \nAl Shabaab is fighting to oust the government and establish its own rule based on its strict interpretation of Islam’s sharia law. \nThe group has been pushed out of most of its urban strongholds but it is able to mount deadly attacks in Mogadishu and elsewhere. \nSomalia has faced violence and lacked a strong central government since President Mohamed Siad Barre was overthrown in 1991.
