Local media also reported his release.\nSaudi security forces rounded up about 200 princes, ministers and business leaders and converted the Ritz-Carlton into a luxurious prison for them in early November in what Riyadh said was a crackdown on corruption.\nThe move was also widely seen by analysts as helping Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman consolidate his grip on power, after he ousted his cousin as heir to the throne in the summer.\nThe most powerful of King Abdullah’s sons, former National Guard chief Prince Miteb bin Abdullah, was released last month after agreeing to pay the government $1 billion.\nPrince Miteb had been the last member of Abdullah’s Shammar branch of the family to retain a key position in the Saudi power structure, after Prince Meshaal and Prince Turki were relieved of their posts as governors in 2015.\nAssaf had been accused of embezzlement related to the expansion of Mecca’s Grand Mosque and taking advantage of his position and inside information to purchase lands, according to a Saudi official.\nSeveral detainees have been freed after agreeing to settlements in which they hand over assets to the state.\nSaudi authorities see the settlements not as blackmail but as an obligation to reimburse money taken illegally from the world’s top oil producer over several decades.\nReporting By Stephen Kalin; Writing By Maha El Dahan; Editing by Rania El Gamal, William Maclean\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-02T14:56:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-02T15:06:31.055+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
