One source said talks between ESR-REIT and Viva have been going on for a few months.\nIn November, ESR Funds Management (S) Ltd, the manager of ESR-REIT, and Sabana Shariah Compliant Industrial REIT called off their talks, which sources said were focussed on ESR-REIT buying Sabana REIT.\nTrading in units of ESR-REIT and Viva was halted on Friday ahead of an announcement.\nESR-REIT, Viva, Warburg Pincus and ESR declined to comment on the merger talks.\nBloomberg first reported the talks.\nReporting by Anshuman Daga; Editing by Himani Sarkar\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-26T11:08:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-26T11:37:18.010+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
