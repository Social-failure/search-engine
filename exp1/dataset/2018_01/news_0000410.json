Khamenei condemned that unrest as “sedition”. \nIn Washington, a senior Trump administration official said the United States aimed to collect “actionable information” that could allow it to pursue sanctions against Iranian individuals and organizations involved in the crackdown. \nBut in Paris, President Emmanuel Macron said the tone of comments from the United States, Israel and Saudi Arabia was “almost one that would lead us to war ... a deliberate strategy for some,” and stressed the importance of keeping a dialogue with Tehran. \nGerman Foreign Minister Sigmar Gabriel expressed concern about the situation escalating. \n“What we urgently advise against is the attempt to abuse this internal Iranian conflict ... internationally. That is not going to ease the situation any way,” he said. \nIn a state-sponsored show of force aimed at countering the outpouring of dissent, thousands of Iranians took part in pro-government rallies in several cities on Wednesday morning. \nState television broadcast live footage of rallies where marchers waved Iranian flags and portraits of Khamenei, Iran’s paramount leader since 1989. \nPro-government marchers chanted: “The blood in our veins is a gift to our leader (Khamenei),” and: “We will not leave our leader alone.” They accused the United States, Israel and Britain of inciting protests, shouting, “The seditionist rioters should be executed!” \nIn the Shi‘ite holy city of Qom, demonstrators chanted “death to American mercenaries”. On Tuesday, the 78-year-old Khamenei had accused Iran’s adversaries of fomenting the protests. \nJafari, the Revolutionary Guards commander, said the pro-government rallies marked an end to protests that he said “were a maximum of 1,500 people in each place, and the number of troublemakers did not exceed 15,000 people nationwide.” RARE ANTI-GOVERNMENT OUTPOURING People take part in pro-government rallies, Iran, January 3, 2018.

NO ARCHIVE. \nU.S. President Donald Trump, who has sought to isolate the Tehran leadership, reversing the conciliatory approach of predecessor Barack Obama, said Washington would throw its support behind the protesters at a suitable time. \n“Such respect for the people of Iran as they try to take back their corrupt government. You will see great support from the United States at the appropriate time!” Trump wrote in the latest of a series of tweets on Iran’s turmoil. \nIn contrast, the leader of Lebanon’s Iran-backed Hezbollah group, Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah, played down the protests as economic discontent, saying they were not rooted in the political issues which spurred huge numbers to demonstrate in 2009 and would end soon. \nHe described them as “nothing to worry about”. \nThe protests seem to be spontaneous, without a clear leader, cropping up in working-class neighborhoods and smaller cities, but the movement seems to be gaining traction among the educated middle class and activists who took part in the 2009 protests. \nMore than 100 Iranian woman activists voiced support for a new uprising in a statement on Wednesday. Several prominent Iranian lawyers, including Nobel Peace Prize laureate Shirin Ebadi, urged Tehran to respect people’s right to freedom of assembly and expression, guaranteed under the constitution.

High Commissioner for Human Rights, called for “thorough, independent and impartial investigations of all acts of violence”. \nHamidreza Abolhassani, a regional judicial official, said a European citizen had been arrested for leading rioters in the Borujerd area of western Iran and was suspected of having been “trained by European intelligence services”. The detainee’s nationality was not given. ROUHANI UNDER PRESSURE \nThe protests have heaped pressure on President Hassan Rouhani, a relative moderate who championed a deal struck with world powers in 2015 to curb Iran’s disputed nuclear program in return for the lifting of most international sanctions. \nMany of the protesters are fuming over what they see as the failure so far of Rouhani’s government to deliver on promises of more jobs and investment as a dividend of the nuclear accord. \nAnger over economic stagnation and reputed graft within the clerical and security hierarchies has been building since last month. Thousands joined a hashtag campaign on Twitter and other sites to vent frustration over the dragging pace of reforms to tackle high unemployment and grant more social freedoms. \nKhamenei and Rouhani have vowed to crack down on high-level corruption and create economic prosperity for all Iranians. \nBut there have been few changes. The Revolutionary Guards, for example, still control a vast, lucrative economic empire. \nWhile more than 20 million out of 80 million Iranians live below the poverty line, the wealthy, including relatives of government officials, import tens of thousands of luxury cars every year. \nTrump must decide by mid-January whether to continue waiving U.S. sanctions on Iran’s oil exports under terms of the nuclear deal he opposed. But if re-imposes sanctions, h", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-03T10:11:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-03T10:18:49.019+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
