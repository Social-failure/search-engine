Christopher Plummer was chosen as Spacey’s replacement, resulting in reshoots of certain scenes. Williams, says the publication, was not told of the negotiations and received a per diem fee of $80. \nThe news caused outrage on social media. I started this last night and now it has been confirmed by others. Michelle Williams paid under 1,000 and Mark Wahlberg paid 1.5m. Williams was told they were all donating their time for the reshoots. THIS IS AN EGREGIOUS GENDER PAY GAP. #paymichelle https://t.co/edORyoNkgf https://t.co/red4f2LQF4 \n— Melissa Silverstein (@melsil) January 10, 2018 So the actress with FOUR OSCAR NOMINATIONS & FOUR BAFTA noms & FIVE GOLDEN GLOBE noms was paid $80 per shoot but the guy who has none of that was paid $1.5M?They've learned nothing out there in Hollywood, have they? \n— Victoria Brownworth (@VABVOX) January 10, 2018 Mark Wahlberg should have had to pay $1.5 million for the privilege of acting opposite Michelle Williams https://t.co/7PgKcxukoG \n— Jordan Zakarin (@jordanzakarin) January 10, 2018 Outrageously unfair- but it’s always been like this. I was never, ever paid even a quarter of what the male lead received: Wahlberg got $1.5M for 'All the Money' reshoot, Williams paid less than $1,000 https://t.co/LrOjrHVjcp \n— Mia Farrow (@MiaFarrow) January 10, 2018 \nThe disparity raises concerns on a number of levels, beyond the basic inequity. Wahlberg and Williams are both represented by William Morris, raising questions about why the agency only secured additional income for one of its clients. \nAnd, per Sony, Williams is considered the lead actress in the film, while Wahlberg is credited as a supporting actor, implying Williams’ role is more important to the film. \nWilliams has been nominated for an Academy Award four times and has five Golden Globe nominations, while Wahlberg has yet to receive a similar nod from either organization. However, critics point out, Wahlberg’s films (ranging from Ted to Daddy’s Home to Planet of the Apes ) have drawn bigger audiences and more money. \nNeither actor has publicly commented on the reports as of Wednesday morning.
