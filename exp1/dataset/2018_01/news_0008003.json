These companies convert people's cryptocurrencies into cash that is loaded on to a prepaid card, allowing people to use the currency for everyday transactions. \nNow these cards are invalid. \nDmitry Lazarichev, co-founder of cryptocurrency card company Wirex, said he's received thousands of calls from frantic customers. He said his company has issued some 500,000 cryptocurrency debit cards to people across the world, although not in the United States. \n\"All the cards were shut down in one second,\" Lazarichev said, adding that WaveCrest hasn't been responsive. \"We asked for more information, but they haven't provided any.\"\nTenX, another cryptocurrency card company affected, tried to reassure users.\nTweet 2 \nCardholders took to social media for answers. \nTweet 1 \nAlexander T., the man in the above tweet, who declined to give his last name, said he uses his cryptocurrency card to book hotels and pay for groceries. Thursday, he had been traveling from Spain to Switzerland, when he stopped in at a bar. His card was declined. \nHe's afraid he'll lose the money on his card.\n\"The problem is, I went on vacation,\" he said. \"I put a lot of money on this card.\"\nHe also worries that this mainstream way of using bitcoin will vanish. \n\"For all people who use bitcoin for their day-to-day expenses, it was the only way to do that,\" he said. \nLast year, Visa and Mastercard prohibited cryptocurrency debit cards outside the European Union. But with bitcoin becoming a household name, Lazarichev said the news came as a shock.\n\"We planned to enter the U.S. market by the end of this year,\" he said.\nMore from Personal Finance: \nAdvisors: Here's what you need to know before investing in bitcoin \nBitcoin is too risky to treat as a 'serious' investment, financial advisers say \nStart the new year with a financial plan", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-05T21:29:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-05T21:36:11.055+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
