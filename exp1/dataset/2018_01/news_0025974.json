On both counts the New York Fed said the increase was largely driven by survey respondents younger than 40. \nThe increases make up some ground after years in which these inflation measures, taken since mid-2013, have generally slipped. The U.S. central bank hiked rates three times last year and aims to do the same in 2018, even while inflation remains below target. \nSurvey respondents were more optimistic about earnings growth. Median one-year ahead expectations were 2.7 percent, up from 2.6 percent in November. It was the highest level since 2014 thanks to respondents primarily between 40 and 60 years old and those earning between $50,000 and $100,000 annually, the New York Fed said. \nThe internet-based survey is done by a third party and taps a rotating panel of about 1,200 household heads.
