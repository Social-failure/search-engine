Horton bought Forestar Group, while Lennar, the second-biggest U.S. home builder, agreed to buy CalAtlantic.\nPulte, which mainly sells single-family homes, expects to deliver between 22,0000 and 23,000 homes this year, up about 5 percent to 10 percent from last year, at an average price of $400,000 to $415,000.\nChief Executive Ryan Marshall said housing demand is expected to remain higher despite climbing interest rates and changes in U.S. tax laws.\nEarlier this month, bigger rival Lennar said strong economic growth in 2018 would offset concerns about housing demand being hit by cuts to tax relief on mortgages.\nPulte's orders in the quarter ended Dec. 31, a measure of its future revenue, expanded at its fastest clip in eleven quarters to rise 14.4 percent to 4,805 homes.\nIn the current quarter, the company expects to sell between 4,250 and 4,500 homes. It sold 4,225 homes a year earlier.\nNet income fell 72 percent to $77.4 million in the fourth quarter, hurt by charges related to the new tax plan and land adjustments.\nOn an adjusted basis, the company said it earned 85 cents per share. Analysts on average expected earnings per share of 85 cents compared with Pulte's profit of 88 cents, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.\nRevenue rose 12.1 percent to $2.79 billion, but missed the average analyst estimate of $2.82 billion.\nSeparately, the company announced on Tuesday a $500 million increase to its share repurchase plan.\nUp to Monday's close, the Atlanta, Georgia-based company's shares had risen 57.2 percent in the last 12 months.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-30T13:50:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-30T16:08:20.001+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
