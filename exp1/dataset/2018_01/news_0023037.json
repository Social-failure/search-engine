(OTC:VICI) (“VICI Properties” or the “Company”), an experiential-asset real estate investment trust, today confirmed it previously received on January 5, 2018 an unsolicited non-binding, written proposal from MGM Growth Properties LLC (NYSE:MGP) (“MGP”) for MGP to acquire all of the outstanding shares of common stock of the Company for $19.50 per share in the form of MGP shares. 1\nVICI Properties, in consultation with its financial and legal advisors, carefully and thoroughly reviewed MGP’s unsolicited and non-binding proposal, following which VICI Properties’ Board of Directors unanimously determined that pursuing it was not in the best interests of the Company and its stockholders.\nEdward Pitoniak, Chief Executive Officer of VICI Properties, said, “VICI’s Board unanimously believes that our prospects as a standalone independent company will deliver significantly superior results for our shareholders. With our high quality, diversified real estate portfolio and best-in-class corporate governance, we are best positioned to successfully execute on our identifiable embedded growth from call-option and right of first refusal assets and our active pipeline of incremental accretive acquisitions. Through this we believe we will create greater long-term value than by pursuing MGP’s proposal.”\nVICI Properties’ Board of Directors communicated its response to MGP in a letter sent to its Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer on January 8, 2018, the full text of which follows:\nJanuary 8, 2018\nMGM Growth Properties\n1980 Festival Plaza Dr., Suite 750\nLas Vegas, NV 89135\nAttention:\nMr. James J. Murren\nChairman of the Board\nMr. James C. Stewart\nChief Executive Officer\nGentlemen:\nIn response to MGP’s unsolicited proposal set forth in your letter dated January 5, 2018 for a potential transaction between VICI and MGP, VICI’s Board of Directors, with the assistance of its financial and legal advisors, has determined that it is not in the best interests of VICI and its shareholders to pursue your proposal. The VICI Board and management team are committed to executing our strategic plan and creating value for our shareholders, and will continue to take action to achieve those objectives.\nSincerely,\n/s/\nJames R. Abrahamson\nChairman of the Board\n/s/\nEdward B.
