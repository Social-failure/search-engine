It has forbidden liquor adverts as one of a number of measures aimed at curbing widespread alcohol abuse. \nPress Express, the largest distributor of print media, now risks being slapped with a fine of up to 30,000 euros (£26,567) per page if it fails to remove or cover up liquor advertisements, its general manager, Vigintas Bartasevicius, said. \n“We know that we create a problem for ourselves and for the publishers, because we cover their content and advertising which was paid for,” he said. \n“Our buyers are of course very unhappy, they created a scandal on social media, so even the official institutions have begun thinking about solving this.” \nBartasevicius said the country’s largest retail chain had refused to stock the altered magazines, deeming them “damaged goods”. \nHowever, he said the publishers of National Geographic had told him they could not create an edition of a magazine free from alcohol ads for a country which only sells up to 500 copies of a title per month. \nPoliticians do not yet have any solution to a problem they have created. \n“It is reminiscent of medieval times and it brings international shame on Lithuania,” Grybauskaite told reporters on Wednesday. “We must have laws without such flaws.” Reporting by Andrius Sytas; Editing by Simon Johnson and Alison Williams", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-10T18:06:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-10T18:17:03.018+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
