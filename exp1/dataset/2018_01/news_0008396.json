Last week Amazon announced that you would soon be able to control your microwave oven from its smart assistant, Alexa.\nWhirlpool said Monday that will be a reality this year, stating that families will be able to control its 2018 range of appliances with voice commands to both Amazon's Alexa and Google's home assistant.\nGetty Images Whirlpool clothes dryers on sale in San Francisco. In a separate press release, also published Monday, Whirlpool said consumers will also soon be able to connect smart appliances to Honeywell's line of thermostats.\nThose capabilities will allow consumers to set their appliance to \"away mode\" when their phone or Apple Watch detects that the homeowner has gone out.\nOne example would be setting a dishwasher to only start its washing cycle once a person was a certain distance away from the property and outside a \"geo-fence\". The company added that managing the temperature of the home could also be set to sync with appliance cycles.\nBrett Dibkey, Whirlpool Corporation vice president of brand strategy in North America, said the new technology would \"take the guesswork out\" of domestic energy management.\nWhirlpool Corporation claims to be the leading appliance manufacturer in the world, with approximately $21 billion in annual sales.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-08T16:27:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-08T16:47:04.019+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
