CONSTRUCTION AND MILITARISATION \nIn recent years, China has built up several reefs and islets into large-scale airstrips and bases as it seeks to assert and enforce its claims to much of the sea, through which some $3 trillion in trade passes annually. The Philippines, Vietnam, Malaysia and Brunei, as well as Taiwan, hold rival claims. \nChinese coastguard and People’s Liberation Army navy ships patrol vast swathes of the South China Sea, routinely shadowing U.S. and other international naval deployments, regional naval officers say. \nZhang Baohui, a mainland security analyst at Hong Kong’s Lingnan University, told Reuters he believed Beijing was rattled by Trump’s sharpening Asia strategy and they might be tempted to react in the South China Sea, even after months of relative calm. \n“We can perhaps expect the Chinese to push ahead with militarisation as retaliation,” he said. \nA new U.S. national defence strategy unveiled last week stressed the need to counter the rising authoritarian powers of China and Russia, outlining a need to better support allies and newer partners against coercion. \nWhile most analysts and regional envoys believe China remains keen to avoid an actual conflict with the significantly more powerful U.S. navy in the South China Sea, it is working to close the gap. \nChina has added bunkers, hangars and advanced radars on its new runways in the Spratlys, although it has not fully equipped them with the advanced surface-to-air and anti-ship missiles they use to protect the Paracels grouping further north. \nSimilarly, Beijing has yet to land jet fighters in the Spratlys - test flights some experts are expecting this year. POTENTIAL FLASHPOINT \nThe latest patrol was at least the fifth such patrol under the Trump administration and the first to Scarborough - one of the more contentious features in the region. \nScarborough, once a U.S. bombing range, was blockaded by the Chinese in 2012, prompting the Philippines to launch its successful legal case in the Hague against China’s excessive territorial claims. \nChina allowed Filipino fishermen back to Scarborough’s rich waters last year, but it remains a potential flashpoint as both sides claim sovereignty and China maintains a steady presence of ships nearby. \nWhile experts and regional envoys expect China to ramp up operations from the Spratlys, none expect it to build on Scarborough - something widely believed to be a red line that would provoke the United States, given its long-standing security treaty with the Philippines. \nShi Yinhong, who heads the Center for American Studies at Beijing’s Renmin University, said China had “lived with” U.S. patrols for several years but the key facts on the ground remained in China’s favour and broader tensions had “improved remarkably”. \n“These islands, especially those with reclaimed land and military capability already deployed, they’re still in Chinese hands,” Shi, who has advised the Chinese government on diplomacy, told Reuters. \n“I don’t think Trump has the stomach and the guts to change this fundamental status quo.” \n(This story has been refiled to correct typo in paragraph 5) Reporting By Greg Torode in Hong Kong and Philip Wen in Beijing; Editing by Lincoln Feast", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-23T08:37:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-23T09:10:51.001+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
