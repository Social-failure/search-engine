In that threat, Dominguez is accused of calling Trump sexist, racist and homophobic.\nRydalch said local and federal law enforcement treat all threats seriously, but there was no evidence Dominguez traveled anywhere to carry out his threats.\nDominguez, who was in custody ahead of a scheduled court appearance on Thursday afternoon, could not be reached for comment.\nThe federal indictment also charged him with using the police tip line in November and December to repeatedly threaten to injure people at a movie theater, conveying false information and threatening to harm police officers.\nIn all, Dominguez faces 11 criminal counts, each carrying a potential sentence of 10 years in prison, the Department of Justice said.\nIn 2003, Dominguez pleaded guilty to charges of abusing an emergency telephone line and vehicle burglary, Utah television station KSL-TV reported, citing court records.\nReporting by Alex Dobuzinskis in Los Angeles; Editing by Dan Whitcomb and Leslie Adler\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-04T03:04:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-04T03:20:38.001+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
