It can be treated with oral rehydration solutions and antibiotics, but spreads rapidly and can kill within hours if not treated.\nReporting by Chris Mfula; Additional reporting by Frank Phiri in Blantyre; Editing by Tiisetso Motsoeneng and Kevin Liffey\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-04T16:22:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-04T17:04:54.001+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
