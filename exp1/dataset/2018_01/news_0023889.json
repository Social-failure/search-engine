So it’s critical to have such a system,” Yagnik said.\nSurat has learned its lessons in resilience the hard way. After an outbreak of plague in 1994, the city - then considered to be among the filthiest in India - set about cleaning up its landfills and sewers, and upgrading slums.\nToday, reminders to segregate garbage and keep the city clean are painted on walls and signposts.\nThe city’s resilience strategy, released last year, includes better mobility, affordable housing, more extensive healthcare and an improved water supply.\n“If we do not build resilience, people will suffer and the economy will suffer. People realize this now,” Yagnik said.\nReporting by Rina Chandran @rinachandran. Editing by Megan Rowling.
