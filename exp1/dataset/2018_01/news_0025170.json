We need to be hard on ourselves. We need to ask ourselves if we are giving 120 percent for the team every time we bowl a ball or play a ball or field a ball. \n“That is something individuals need to reflect on themselves, but as a team we are definitely going to lay out these things in the open. We will ask the guys to be honest about what they were feeling at particular stages in the game.

The mistakes that we made have been really about not putting attention to detail at important stages of the game.” \nKohli appeared particularly irritated when quizzed on team selection and whether the right XI had been selected for the second test, saying he and the selectors had picked a side they believed could win the test.

But you make one decision and you back it. \n“We certainly don’t sit here and say, ‘Oh, if you fail in one game you are not good enough to be at this level. \n“We played with teams before that have looked really strong and have lost as well.” \nThe third test starts in Johannesburg on Jan. 24.
