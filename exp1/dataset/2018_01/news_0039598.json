So I think we are now looking... to turn that policy in a very sustained way. It has to be sustainable and it has to continue to sustain the recovery.\"\nThe ECB is due to meet Thursday but is unlikely to announce changes to its current monetary policy so early in the year. But analysts foresee policy changes at the following meeting in March.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-24T10:32:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-24T11:14:59.007+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
