The shrinking pool of workers can only lead to more wage growth, they argue, which in turn will boost the overall weak inflation picture that has vexed Federal Reserve officials.\nThey believe the tax reform package Congress passed in December will help add to wage growth. Multiple companies already have announced they are awarding bonuses based on a windfall from the slashed corporate tax level. Most American workers also will be seeing tax reductions.\nThe wage-growth argument, though, got only a marginal boost from the December numbers.\nAverage hourly earnings rose 0.3 percent for the month to reflect an annualized gain of 2.5 percent â€” both about in line with economist expectations but still around the prevailing levels that have kept wages in check for most of the post-recession period.\nScott Eisen | Bloomberg | Getty Images An employee attaches a tag to a jacket at the Joseph Abboud Manufacturing facility in New Bedford, Massachusetts. Despite the slowness, the Fed is expected to proceed with at least three rate hikes this year, with several prominent central bank watchers making room for the possibility of a fourth move. The Fed's pace is important in that it not only determines the interest rate for most consumer debt but also indicates how concerned officials are with the pace of growth.\nIf officials believe growth is getting out of hand, they're more likely to get aggressive with rate hikes and possibly choke off what is expected to be a strong year.\nFed officials have indicated they believe the weakness in inflation won't last, a sentiment that is gaining a growing list of adherents.\n\"The increase of average hourly earnings at a 2.5 percent rate on a year ago basis likely understates the true pace of wage and compensation growth due to a tight labor market,\" said Joe Brusuelas, chief U.S. economist at RSM.\n\"With the major narrative going forward is likely to be where firms will get the skilled workers necessary to boost productivity and meet demand it is likely that wages will accelerate in 2018,\" he added. \"With wage gains in metro areas starting to pick up, and minimum and livable wages slated to rise starting in January we think that wages and overall compensation will accelerate in 2018 reaching 4 percent by the end of the year.\"\nIf that happens, it will represent the final piece of the puzzle both for economic growth and Fed policy.\nThe central bank is tasked both with maintaining an economy at full employment and price stability that officials believe equates to 2 percent inflation. A meaningful gain in wages would mean the recovery has come full circle and the Fed can continue to normalize policy after the highly accommodative measures during and following the financial crisis.\n\"Look at where the jobs are being created. These are career-type jobs,\" JJ Kinahan, chief market strategist at TD Ameritrade, said of growth in manufacturing and construction that happened in December. \"It's headed in the right direction.\"\nWATCH: Jim Cramer talks about the impact from Friday's jobs report .\nshow chapters For the record, this is a good jobs report: Economist 5 Hours Ago | 02:54", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-05T19:28:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-05T19:44:51.123+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
