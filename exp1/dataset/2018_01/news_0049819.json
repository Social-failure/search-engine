The rift involved the latter four cutting diplomatic and transport ties with Doha and led to banks from those countries pulling funds out of Qatar. \nCBQ Group Chief Executive Joseph Abraham told Reuters in September that the bank was considering borrowing on the Taiwanese bond market. One of sources Reuters spoke to on Sunday said CBQ was also considering other bond markets such as Australia. \nQatar National Bank, the largest bank in Qatar and the Middle East, last week completed a 700 million Australian dollar Kangaroo bond. A few days earlier the bank had issued a $720 million, 30-year Formosa bond, a bond sold in Taiwan by foreign issuers and denominated in currencies other than the Taiwanese dollar. \nOne of the sources said CBQ would push ahead with either bonds or a loan or both, adding that the loan could range between $200 million to $500 million.
