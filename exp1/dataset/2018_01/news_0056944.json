The fund then buys the shares back at a later date and returns them, hopefully pocketing a profit. \nHeading into Wednesday, just CapeView, AQR and Henderson Global Investors had short positions totalling more than 0.5 percent of Capita’s stock, the level above which Britain’s Financial Conduct Authority demands disclosure. \nThe biggest winner was U.S.-based computer-driven investor AQR Capital Management, which had a 2.91 percent short position, the data showed. As of 1525 GMT, its paper profit stood at 30.5 million pounds ($43.36 million), Reuters calculations showed. \nLondon-based CapeView, meanwhile, had a 0.61 percent short position and Henderson 0.52 percent, the data showed, making them paper profits of 6.4 million pounds and 5.5 million pounds, respectively, Reuters calculations showed. \nAQR and CapeView declined to comment when contacted by Reuters while Henderson did not immediately respond to a request for comment. \nIt is not known how many funds had short positions below the 0.5 percent threshold for disclosure, but in total, just over 32 million shares of the company’s 660.41 million issued shares were out on loan, data from Astec Analytics showed. \nThe shares actually being used by hedge funds accounted for around a fifth of those which had been put up for loan, the data showed.
