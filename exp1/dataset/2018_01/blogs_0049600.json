He also reiterated his $104 price target for EA stock, which is 9 percent lower than Thursday's close. \nThe analyst said research and development spending growth is accelerating for gaming companies. He noted R&D budgets for the four largest publishers grew at roughly a 1 percent annual rate from 2010 to 2015, then rose to more than 8 percent per year the last two years. \nCreutz said the outrage over the initial money-making strategy in EA's \"Star Wars Battlefront II\" likely hurt the title's sales by 3 million to 4 million units versus the company's 14 million guidance. He noted Activision's \"Destiny 2\" player engagement is waning after the community questioned the game's design decisions. \nThe \"industry plans to further expand live services revenue appear to have run into some roadblocks with gamers sounding off against some recent titles, notably EA's \"Star Wars Battlefront II\" and Activision's \"Destiny 2\" (though the issues with the latter go beyond just MTX),\" he wrote. \"We think writing off angry gamers as largely irrelevant is a mistake.\" \nHe added: \n\"[Star Wars Battlefront II] has pretty clearly significantly underperformed expectations and remains without a live services revenue stream, while Destiny 2 has at the least suffered some unwanted engagement attrition. We suspect that 2018 will see a pullback on industry attempts to aggressively drive MTX growth as a result.\" \nThe analyst also warned gaming industry stocks may falter due to high expectations. \n\"Current valuations are pricing in an awful lot of good news, with an investor base that seems at least somewhat complacent,\" he wrote. \"It's not just that gamers are angry and complaining; there have clearly been performance consequences for the games involved. And in an industry where every company is dependent upon a relatively small number of franchises, this matters.\" \nElectronic Arts and Activision Blizzard did not immediately respond to requests for comment.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-26T21:38:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-26T21:52:02.012+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
