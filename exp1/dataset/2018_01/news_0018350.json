The army appointed a senior officer to investigate.\nA statement from the military on Wednesday said its investigation had found that members of the security forces had taken part in the killing and action would be taken against them.\nThe Rohingya crisis erupted after Rohingya insurgent attacks on security posts on Aug. 25 in Rakhine triggered a fierce military response that the United Nations denounced as ethnic cleansing.\nMyanmar denies ethnic cleansing, saying its security forces had mounted legitimate counter-insurgency clearance operations.
