It was a difficult start,” he told the dakar.com website.\nPeugeot’s reigning champion Stephane Peterhansel of France, who is chasing a 14th Dakar win, was in 11th place and two minutes 15 seconds off the pace.\nPortuguese soccer manager Andre Villas Boas, entering his first Dakar, was in 46th place and 11 minutes behind al-Attiyah’s time.\nIn the motorcycles, KTM’s Dubai-based Sunderland ended the stage with a 32-second advantage over Yamaha’s French rider Adrien van Beveren.\nThe motorcycles will start after the cars in Sunday’s second stage, a 267km loop that starts and ends in Pisco.\n“Tomorrow, if we open the road, I know it will be very difficult, but I‘m just really happy for today,” said al-Attiyah.\nOf the 523 entrants in all categories, 114 were making their debuts in the 40th edition of the race, which ends in Cordoba, Argentina, on Jan. 20.\nReporting by Alan Baldwin in London, editing by Ed Osmond\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-07T00:03:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-07T00:21:20.021+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
