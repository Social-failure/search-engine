Here are some highlights from the document as published by Axios: Half of the appropriations in the leaked plan will go toward an \"infrastructure incentives\" program giving federal grants to state, local or private entities. Grant awards can cover up to 20 percent of the total cost of the infrastructure plan, according to the document. Ten percent of the total bill would go to a so-called Transformative Projects Program that funds \"exploratory and ground-breaking ideas that have more risk than standard infrastructure projects but offer a larger reward profile.\" Through the Transformative Projects Program, the federal government would pay for up to 80 percent of capital construction costs, as well as 30 percent of demonstration trials and 50 percent of post-demonstration planning costs.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-22T21:53:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-22T22:11:14.012+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
