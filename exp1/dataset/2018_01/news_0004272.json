Some strategists said traders were wary of taking big positions ahead of Wednesday’s scheduled introduction of the wide-ranging EU financial markets directive known as MiFID II, aimed at making European markets more transparent and providing better value for investors.\nThe dollar index hit a 3-1/2-month trough of 91.751 and was last down 0.1 percent at 91.996. For 2017, the dollar index slid more than 9.8 percent, its weakest year since 2003.\nThe euro has been on a tear especially since the second half of last year, on optimism over a brightening economic picture in the euro zone.\nIn 2017, the single currency posted its strongest year against the dollar since 2003 as European economies strengthened and expectations grew that the ECB will wind down monetary stimulus.\nThe euro EUR= added more gains to start the new year, climbing to a nearly four-month high of $1.2082. It was last up 0.2 percent at $1.2033.\nEuro zone manufacturers ended 2017 by ramping up activity at the fastest pace in more than two decades, a survey showed on Tuesday, and rising demand suggests they will start the new year on a high.\nThe European Central Bank’s Benoit Coeure said on the weekend he saw a “reasonable chance” the bank’s bond purchases would not be extended beyond September.\n“It’s a combination of dollar weakness and euro strength. The euro strength is underpinned by some hawkish comments from the ECB’s Coeure,” said Commerzbank currency strategist Thu Lan Nguyen in Frankfurt.\nReporting by Gertrude Chavez-Dreyfuss; Additional reporting by Tommy Wilkes in London; Editing by David Gregorio\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-02T11:14:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-02T13:10:11.012+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
