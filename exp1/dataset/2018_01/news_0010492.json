( on.wsj.com/2Eyo7yA )\nIntel has identified three issues in updates released over the past week for “microcode,” or firmware, the newspaper reported, citing a confidential document the company had shared with some customers that it had reviewed.\nThe world’s largest chipmaker confirmed last week that the security issues reported by researchers in the company’s widely used microprocessors could allow hackers to steal sensitive information from computers, phones and other electronic devices.\nIntel shares were down about half a percent to $43.20 in after-hours trading after the announcement. Intel shares have lost 4.5 percent since the news of the chip flaws emerged on Jan. 3.\nReporting by Uday Sampath and Sonam Rai in Bengaluru; and Stephen Nellis in San Francisco; editing by G Crosse and Lisa Shumaker\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-12T02:34:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-12T02:45:02.008+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
