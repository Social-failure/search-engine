He was speaking as of 8 a.m. Korean time (2300 GMT, Sunday). \nThe Sanchi tanker run by Iran’s top oil shipping operator, collided with the CF Crystal <C}BO7309522955> about 160 nautical miles off China’s coast near Shanghai and the mouth of the Yangtze River Delta on Saturday evening. \nChinese state media CCTV showed pictures on Sunday of the tanker ablaze and billowing plumes of thick dark smoke. China sent four rescue ships and three cleaning boats to the site, while South Korea dispatched a ship and a helicopter. \nThe Panama-registered tanker was sailing from Iran to South Korea, carrying 136,000 tonnes of condensate, an ultra light crude. That is equivalent to just under 1 million barrels, worth about $60 million, based on global crude oil prices.
