As of now, a Reuters poll suggests consumer prices would rise 1.7 percent from the year before in Europe’s largest economy. \n“Inflation data from Germany could be the game changer today, we already saw the print from Saxony was disappointing,” said DZ Bank analyst Sebastian Fellechner. \nConsumer prices in the German state of Saxony were up by 1.4 percent year-on-year, the state’s statistics office said on Tuesday, compared to a 1.7 percent rise in December. \nPrices in Brandenburg were up by 1.7 percent year-on-year. \nThe ECB’s target is for inflation of just below 2 percent in the euro zone. \n“If German inflation readings are weaker, we would enter a consolidation mode as questions are raised on the sustained inflation dynamics in the euro zone,” said Fellechner. \nYields across the euro zone have risen sharply in recent weeks as a booming European economy has fuelled expectations that the ECB will end extraordinary stimulus sooner rather than later, potentially at the end of this year. \nCurrently the bank buys 30 billion euros of assets every month, a scheme that is set to run to September. \nFor example, the yield on Germany’s 10-year government bond, the benchmark for the bloc, rose from 0.306 percent in the first week of December to an over two-year high of 0.707 percent on Monday. \nBut it dropped once again on Tuesday, initially to a low of 0.675 percent after the Saxony numbers, before recovering a touch to 0.68 percent after the Brandenburg print. \nLow-rated Southern European government bonds, seen as more dependent on ECB largesse, outperformed, with yields lower 3-4 bps. \nThis fall in yields came despite an upcoming auction of Italian debt. \nItaly is scheduled to sell 5.5-6.5 billion euros in bonds including a 50-year bond and a new 10-year bond. \nItaly has been in the spotlight in recent weeks with investors expecting some volatility in the run-up to a March 4 general election. \nHowever, a strengthening euro zone economy has taken the edge off concerns over the popularity of anti-establishment party 5-Star Movement, and the Italy-Germany 10-year government bond yield spread is still close to tight levels at 138 bps. \nThe speculation over the ECB exit from stimulus also hit global bonds. Japan’s 10-year yield hit a 6 1/2-month high of 0.095. \nThe French economy rounded off its strongest year since 2011, official data showed on Tuesday. The euro zone’s second biggest economy grew 0.6 percent in the October through December period, up from the previous quarter when it grew 0.5 percent. \nGDP data for the euro zone is also due out later on Tuesday.
