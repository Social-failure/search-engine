The tariff will enter into force on Wednesday and last for five years. \nThe duties are lower than the provisional duties of between 25.3 and 42.8 percent set in August. The EU said the amounts collected should be held, but the difference refunded. \nThe EU at the same time terminated its investigation into cast iron imports from India, finding there to be no dumping. \nThe case could well lead to a legal challenge as China complained that it should no longer have been treated as a non-market economy from December 2016. \nThe non-market economy status allowed its prices to be compared with those of an “analogue” country, where normal market economics did apply. In this case, India was chosen. \nThe EU has subsequently changed the way it handles anti-dumping cases for China.
