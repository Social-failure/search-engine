However, many banks don't want anything to do with pot money for fear it could expose them to legal trouble from the federal government, which still lists marijuana as illegal.\nThat means a lot of pot business is conducted in cash, sometimes tens of thousands of dollars, which is risky for cannabis workers and the public.\nIs a public bank a solution?\n\"Maybe,\" said Chiang, a Democratic candidate for governor.\nCompleting the study is expected to take about a year.\nHowever, the idea comes with formidable risks that were outlined in a state report last year, including unknown startup costs, the probability of losses for several years or more that California taxpayers would have to cover and trouble obtaining federal regulatory approval.\nAnother problem: The Trump administration has signaled a potentially more aggressive approach to marijuana prosecution by U.S. prosecutors.\nThat federal action \"casts into turmoil a newly established industry that is creating jobs and tax revenues,\" Chiang said.\nThe shortage of banking services means sellers and growers must often do without commonplace conveniences such as writing checks or obtaining a loan. In Los Angeles, officials have seen bags of cash as large as $300,000 come through the door to cover pot taxes.\nAccording to the state report last year, the Bank of North Dakota is the nation's only deposit-holding, publicly owned financial institution. It has one office and offers limited retail banking services.\nChiang compared the problem in California to conditions that led to the creation of the North Dakota bank in 1919.\nAt that time \"private banks failed to promote agriculture, commerce and industry in the rural state, so the public bank was created,\" he said. The failure to meet the needs of the multibillion-dollar cannabis industry in California \"could well turn out to be the catalyst that vaults public banking into a reality here.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-30T23:35:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-31T00:51:00.005+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
