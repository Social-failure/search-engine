According to Bloomberg, May finds it almost impossible to hold phone calls with Trump because he talks over her, while the president feels May should be able to do more to quell expected protests that are standing in the way of Trump's desire to pay a state visit to the U.K.\nTensions between the two were not on display in Davos, however.\n\"I have great respect for everything you're doing,\" Trump told May. \"We love your country. We think it's truly great.\"\nTrump then highlighted the longstanding trade and mutual defense pacts between the two nations, telling May, \"There's nothing that would happen to you, that we won't be there to fight for you.\"\nMay was more reserved, telling Trump, \"We're facing the same challenges across the world and, as you say, we're working together to defeat those challenges and to meet them.\"\nThe prime minister has publicly broken with the president several times during Trump's first year in office, including an episode just two months ago, when May publicly rebuked Trump for tweeting out anti-Muslim videos from a far-right British political fringe figure.\nNot surprisingly, Trump hit back, tweeting directly at May, \"don't focus on me, focus on the destructive Radical Islamic Terrorism that is taking place within the United Kingdom.\"\nTrump tweet\nThe tweet Trump released after Thursday's meeting, however, struck a very different tone than he had in November. \"Great bilateral meeting with Prime Minister Theresa May of the United Kingdom, affirming the special relationship and our commitment to work together on key national security challenges and economic opportunities,\" the president wrote.\nTRUMP TWEET", "external_links": ["https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2018-01-24/inside-the-dysfunctional-relationship-of-donald-trump-and-theresa-may", "https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/936037588372283392"], "published": "2018-01-25T18:14:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-25T17:41:09.020+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
