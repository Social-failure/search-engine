Comcast’s video business has been pressured as more consumers cancel their cable packages in favor of cheaper streaming options from companies like Netflix Inc .\nRevenue rose 4.2 percent to $21.92 billion from the year-earlier period, roughly in line with analyst expectations of $21.82 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.\nNet income attributable to Comcast rose to $15.0 billion, or $3.17 per share, for the quarter, up from $2.3 billion, or 48 cents per share. The company was able to book a gain on its deferred tax bill thanks to newly lowered U.S. corporate tax rates.\nRevenue rose 3.4 percent in the cable business, which includes video, internet and voice services. Comcast added 350,000 high-speed internet customers in the quarter, compared with a gain of 385,000 the same period a year earlier.\nNBCUniversal’s revenue rose 3.9 percent in the quarter, helped by the segment’s theme parks business.
