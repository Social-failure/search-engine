Obviously the first set took me some energy, some power. I had some chances. I didn’t play well on them,” the 25-year-old added. \n“She didn’t play anything, like, any perfect shot. Everything was my mistake. Next time I knew I had to play everything better.” \nStanding in Pliskova’s path to a maiden Melbourne Park semi-final is world number one Simona Halep, who she has played seven times before and beaten just twice - both in Fed Cup ties. \n“I think there is always chance to beat her. It’s going to be about me,” Pliskova said. \n”I have to play well to win. I have to serve well, otherwise she has, I would not say dangerous game but if I don’t play well I don’t have the chance to win against her. \n“I have to play something to beat her, have to have some winners, some aces against her. I have to get my mindset ready for this.” \nPliskova said she had put the coaching controversy with Strycova out of her mind before Monday’s match. \n“I just try to put everything what happened between us away from this because it was a normal match basically,” said Pliskova. \n”I was just trying to play my game because I know if I would get into it, think about what everything happened with the coaches and with her, I would not be playing the best. \n“I think this I did perfect. Whoever is coaching her, I‘m just happy right now with my team. These things are not my business any more.” Reporting by Nick Mulvenney in Sydney, editing by Peter Rutherford", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-23T05:03:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-23T05:21:24.010+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
