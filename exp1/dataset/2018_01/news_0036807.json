AIRBUS-BOMBARDIER DEAL \nA win for Boeing would not deter Bombardier from continuing to target U.S. airline customers. Bombardier has struck a deal with Airbus SE ( AIR.PA ), expected to close this year, giving the European planemaker a majority stake in the CSeries and the ability to assemble the planes in Alabama starting in 2019 for delivery to Delta. \nWhile Bombardier says CSeries assembled in Alabama would be duty-free, Boeing has challenged those plans. The two planemakers have clashed on whether the case that mentions aircraft and “partially assembled” aircraft from Canada, would lead to duties on parts used in the CSeries. \nPearson said by email that foreign parts, like a wing made in Belfast, should not face a duty, but there could be charge on Canadian-made parts. \n“This week’s vote by the ITC is an opportunity to restore a level playing field and recommit to the global trading rules we have all agreed to,” said Boeing spokesman Dan Curran on Tuesday. \nBut Bombardier called Boeing’s trade case self-serving after the U.S. planemaker revealed on Dec. 21 it was discussing a “potential combination” with Embraer. \n“This case is nothing more than Boeing’s transparent attempt to misuse the U.S. trade laws to create an artificial market advantage for itself, including its recent move to acquire Embraer – the CSeries’ true competitor – while simultaneously trying to block the CSeries from the U.S. market,” Bombardier spokesman Mike Nadolski said by email. \nBoeing spokesman Curran denied that the company’s ongoing conversations with Embraer have anything to do with its case against Bombardier. \nEmbraer declined to comment.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-23T22:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-23T22:17:06.002+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
