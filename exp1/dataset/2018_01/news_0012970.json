The index got a boost from financial and energy stocks, with Vincom Retail JSC ending 6 percent up and Petrovietnam Gas Joint Stock Corp adding 1 percent. Foreign and domestic inflow into the market rose, with the macroeconomic environment being stable, said Bui Nguyen Khoa, senior analyst at BIDV Securities Company. \"The Vietnam Index may see new peaks in the first quarter of 2018.\" In Singapore, index heavyweight Jardine Matheson Holdings Ltd fell 2.4 percent, dragging the FTSE Straits Times index down.
