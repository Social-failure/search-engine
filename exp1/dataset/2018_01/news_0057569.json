(Farmers) (NASDAQ: FMNB) today reported financial results for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2017.\nNet income for the three months ended December 31, 2017 was $5.2 million, or $0.19 per diluted share, which compares to $5.4 million, or $0.20 per diluted share, for the three months ended December 31, 2016 and $6.0 million or $0.22 per diluted share for the linked quarter. Excluding a $1.8 million adjustment of the net deferred tax asset resulting from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act that became law in December 2017, offset by tax equated, net acquisition-related adjustments of $48 thousand, net income for the three month period ended December 31, 2017 would have been $7.0 million.\nAnnualized return on average assets and return on average equity were 0.96% and 8.60%, respectively, for the three month period ending December 31, 2017, compared to 1.08% and 9.74% for the same three month period in 2016, and 1.12% and 10.15% for the linked quarter. Excluding the net deferred tax asset adjustment and the acquisition-related adjustments, the annualized return on average assets and annualized return on average equity for the fourth quarter of 2017 would have been 1.29% and 11.56%, respectively. Farmers’ return on average tangible equity (Non-GAAP) was 10.69% for the quarter ended December 31, 2017 compared to 12.34% for the same quarter in 2016 and 12.69% for the linked quarter. Excluding the acquisition expenses and the deferred tax asset adjustment the return on average tangible equity would have been 14.25%.\nNet income for the year ended December 31, 2017 was $22.7 million, or $0.82 per diluted share, compared to $20.6 million or $0.76 per diluted share for 2016. Return on average assets and return on average equity were 1.09% and 9.92%, respectively, for the year ending December 31, 2017, compared to 1.07% and 9.72% for 2016. Excluding the net deferred tax asset adjustment and the acquisition-related adjustments, net income for the twelve month period ended December 31, 2017 would have been $24.8 million or $0.90 per diluted share, and the return on average assets and return on average equity would have been 1.19% and 10.83%, while the return on average tangible equity would have been 13.48%.\nOn December 22, 2017, H.R.1, known as the “Tax Cuts and Jobs Act,” was signed into law. H.R.1, among other things, reduces the corporate income tax rate to 21%, effective January 1, 2018. As a result of passage of the new tax law, Farmers completed a revaluation of its net deferred tax assets. The Company’s deferred tax assets, net of deferred tax liabilities, represent corporate tax benefits anticipated to be realized in the future. The reduction in the federal corporate tax rate, effective January 1, 2018, reduces these benefits. Farmers determined that its net deferred tax assets would be reduced by approximately $1.8 million in the fourth quarter of 2017, representing an impact on earnings per share of approximately $0.06 per diluted share based fourth quarter weighted average diluted shares outstanding of approximately 27.5 million.\nFarmers National Bank has expanded the Commercial Lending Team and its footprint with the addition of three new hires at a new office located in Beachwood, Ohio, a high net-worth marketplace. The Beachwood office is comprised of a Commercial Lending Team Leader and Market President, a Senior Commercial Relationship Manager and a Vice President, Senior Commercial Relationship Manager. Management believes this new expansion will enhance its lending presence in Northeastern Ohio.\nKevin J. Helmick, President and CEO, stated, “We are happy to report a record year in net income for Farmers, and we are excited about our success and entrance into expanded markets and remain focused on our strategic growth plan which has paved the way for the company to exceed $2 billion in assets in 2017. We continue to be encouraged by our loan growth, which has increased 10.5% during the past twelve months, and our 3.5% increase in noninterest income on a year over year basis.”\n2017 Fourth Quarter Financial Highlights\nLoan growth\nTotal loans were $1.58 billion at December 31, 2017, compared to $1.43 billion at December 31, 2016, representing an increase of 10.5%. The increase in loans is a result of Farmers’ focus on loan growth utilizing a talented lending and credit team, while adhering to a sound underwriting discipline. The increase in loans has occurred mainly in the commercial real estate, residential real estate and agricultural loan categories. Loans now comprise 77.7% of the Bank's average earning assets for the year ended December 31, 2017, an improvement compared to 76.3% for the same period in 2016. This improvement, along with the growth in earning assets, has resulted in a 10.7% increase in tax equated loan income from 2016 to 2017. Loan quality\nNon-performing assets to total assets remain at a low level, currently 0.36%. Early stage delinquencies, which are loans 30 – 89 days delinquent, also continue to remain at low levels, at $10.2 million, or 0.65% of total loans, at December 31, 2017. Net charge-offs for the current quarter were $189 thousand, compared to $656 thousand in the same quarter in 2016 and total net charge-offs as a percentage of average net loans outstanding was only 0.05% for the quarter ended December 31, 2017. Lending to the energy sector is insignificant and less than 1% of the loan portfolio. Net interest margin\nThe net interest margin for the three months ended December 31, 2017 was 3.98%, a 3 basis points increase from the quarter ended December 31, 2016. In comparing the fourth quarter of 2017 to the same period in 2016, asset yields increased 17 basis points, while the cost of interest-bearing liabilities increased 20 basis points. The net interest margin is impacted by the additional accretion as a result of the discounted loan portfolios acquired in the previous mergers, which increased the net interest margin by 3 and 7 basis points for the quarters ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Noninterest income\nNoninterest income decreased slightly to $6.05 million for the quarter ended December 31, 2017 compared to $6.08 million in 2016. Trust fees increased $140 thousand or 9.5% in the current year’s quarter compared to the same quarter in 2016, and debit card interchange fees also increased $108 thousand or 15%. These increases were offset by a decrease in other operating income of $258 thousand and a decrease in investment commissions of $50 thousand. Noninterest expenses\nFarmers has remained committed to managing the level of noninterest expenses. Total noninterest expenses for the fourth quarter of 2017 increased to $15.4 million compared to $15 million in the same quarter in 2016, primarily as a result of increases in salaries and employee benefits of $449 thousand, merger related costs of $433 thousand and advertising expense of $320 thousand. These increases were offset by decreases in other operating expenses of $459 thousand, occupancy and equipment expense of $220 thousand and professional fees of $160 thousand. It is important to note that annualized noninterest expenses measured as a percentage of quarterly average assets decreased from 3.01% in the fourth quarter of 2016 to 2.83% in the fourth quarter of 2017. Efficiency ratio\nThe efficiency ratio for the quarter ended December 31, 2017 improved to 59.1% compared to 60.4% for the same quarter in 2016. The main factors leading to this improvement were the increase in net interest income and the stabilized level of noninterest expenses relative to average assets as explained in the preceding paragraphs.\n2018 Outlook\nMr. Helmick added, “We are pleased by the improvement in our financial results for 2017. As we look forward to 2018, we continue to focus our energy on the seamless integration of our newly acquired bank and customers and we remain committed to the businesses and families we serve and to our community banking approach and culture.”\nFounded in 1887, Farmers National Banc Corp. is a diversified financial services company headquartered in Canfield, Ohio, with $2.2 billion in banking assets and $1 billion in trust assets.
