For the quarter, the Company reported income available to common shareholders of $9.3 million, or $0.17 diluted earnings per common share (\"EPS\"). On a non-GAAP basis, EPS excluding non-core revenues and non-core expenses (\"Core EPS\") in the fourth quarter of 2017 was $1.33 per common share vs. $1.16 per common share in the year-ago period, an increase of 15% (refer to press release supplemental tables for a reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP metrics).\nDaryl G. Byrd, President and Chief Executive Officer, commented, \"We delivered solid core earnings during the fourth quarter of 2017, achieving our Company's highest quarterly Core EPS result and providing a glimpse into the strong underlying earnings power of the franchise. Our team's focus and strategic positioning drove significant improvement over the prior quarter as we continue to reap the benefits of our asset sensitive balance sheet and start to realize the synergies from the Sabadell acquisition following the conversion in mid-October. Similar to many other banks, our GAAP metrics were materially impacted by one-time charges - the most significant of which was a write-down of deferred tax assets resulting from the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act on December 22, 2017. Despite the one-time DTA adjustment in the quarter, we expect this tax change will significantly benefit our net income in future periods.\"\nByrd continued, \"We are proud of the results we have achieved in the fourth quarter of 2017 and recognize the opportunity to build on current momentum in delivering improved financial results. In December, we provided financial guidance for our 2018 earnings and we continue to work towards achieving those goals to provide outstanding returns for our shareholders. During the first quarter of 2018, we will be providing our three-year goals, which we will refer to as our 2020 Goals.\"\nHighlights for the fourth quarter of 2017 and at December 31, 2017:\nWhile GAAP EPS and returns were negatively impacted by one-time items, the Company reported solid improvement in Core EPS driven by a strong core operating leverage multiple of 4.7, GAAP and cash margin expansion, cost containment and balance sheet growth during the quarter.\nFor the three months ended\nGAAP\nNon-GAAP Core\n4Q17\n3Q17\n4Q17\n3Q17\nEarnings Per Common Share\n$ 0.17\n$ 0.49\n$ 1.33\n$ 1.00\nReturn on Average Assets\n0.15\n%\n0.45\n%\n1.03\n%\n0.87\n%\nReturn on Average Common Equity\n1.02\n%\n2.92\n%\n7.92\n%\n5.99\n%\nReturn on Average Tangible Common Equity\n—\n—\n12.73\n%\n8.95\n%\nEfficiency Ratio\n63.5\n%\n75.2\n%\n57.9\n%\n60.6\n%\nTangible Efficiency Ratio (TE)\n—\n—\n55.6\n%\n58.2\n%\nThe Company's reported and cash net interest margins increased 5 and 4 basis points on a linked quarter basis, to 3.69% and 3.33%, respectively, primarily as a result of increases in average earning assets and higher loan yields, offset by smaller increases in average interest-bearing liabilities and costs of deposits. 4Q17 results include a $51.0 million estimated net impact of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act enacted on December 22, 2017 ($0.94 per share decrease in earnings), subject to refinement in future periods as further information becomes available. The effective tax rate in 2018 is expected to be 21% - 22%, which revises our previous guidance of 32.5% - 33.5% disclosed prior to the passing of tax reform. Total loan growth was $0.3 billion, or 1.4% (5.6% annualized rate), in 4Q17, driven by originations in New Orleans, Atlanta and Tampa. Total deposits increased $0.1 billion, or 0.6% (2.4% annualized rate), in 4Q17, driven by growth in the Houston, Acadiana, New Orleans and Baton Rouge markets. Net charge-offs decreased $18.7 million on a linked quarter basis, and equated to an annualized 0.20% of average loans. The provision for loan losses decreased $4.1 million, or 22%. The Company successfully completed the conversion of branch and operating systems associated with the Sabadell acquisition over the weekend of October 13 - 15, 2017. The Company incurred $11.4 million of pre-tax merger-related expense in 4Q17 ($0.16 per share decrease in earnings). On October 19, 2017, the Company entered into a Merger Agreement with Gibraltar Private Bank & Trust Company (\"Gibraltar\"). The Merger Agreement has been approved by the boards of directors of each company and is expected to close in the first quarter of 2018, subject to the required approval of Gibraltar's shareholders, the receipt of required regulatory approvals, and other customary closing conditions.\nTable A - Summary Financial Results\n(Dollars in thousands, except per share data)\nFor the Three Months Ended\n12/31/2017\n9/30/2017\n% Change\n12/31/2016\n% Change\nGAAP BASIS:\nIncome available to common shareholders\n$\n9,329\n$\n26,046\n(64.2)\n$\n44,173\n(78.9)\nEarnings per common share - diluted\n0.17\n0.49\n(65.3)\n1.04\n(83.7)\nAverage loans, net of unearned income\n$\n19,941,500\n$\n18,341,154\n8.7\n$\n14,912,350\n33.7\nAverage total deposits\n21,378,122\n19,785,328\n8.1\n16,893,643\n26.5\nNet interest margin (TE) (1)\n3.69\n%\n3.64\n%\n3.38\n%\nTotal revenues\n$\n290,163\n$\n269,950\n7.5\n$\n214,903\n35.0\nTotal non-interest expense\n184,384\n202,986\n(9.2)\n151,570\n21.6\nEfficiency ratio\n63.5\n%\n75.2\n%\n70.5\n%\nReturn on average assets\n0.15\n0.45\n0.85\nReturn on average common equity\n1.02\n2.92\n6.70\nNON-GAAP BASIS (2) :\nCore revenues\n$\n290,128\n$\n270,192\n7.4\n$\n214,898\n35.0\nCore non-interest expense\n167,910\n163,686\n2.6\n133,562\n25.7\nCore earnings per common share - diluted\n1.33\n1.00\n33.0\n1.16\n14.7\nCore tangible efficiency ratio (TE) (1) (4)\n55.6\n%\n58.2\n%\n60.3\n%\nCore return on average assets\n1.03\n0.87\n0.94\nCore return on average common equity\n7.92\n5.99\n7.44\nCore return on average tangible common equity (4)\n12.73\n8.95\n10.75\nNet interest margin (TE) - cash basis (1) (3)\n3.33\n3.29\n3.16\n(1) Fully taxable equivalent (TE) calculations include the tax benefit associated with related income sources that are tax-exempt using a rate of 35%, which approximates the marginal tax rate.\n(2) See Table 9 and Table 10 for GAAP to Non-GAAP reconciliations.\n(3) See Table 8 for adjustments related to purchase discounts on acquired loans and related accretion and the impact of the FDIC indemnification asset.\n(4) Tangible calculations eliminate the effect of goodwill and acquisition related intangible assets and the corresponding amortization expense on a tax-effected basis where applicable.\nOperating Results\nNet interest income increased 9% on a linked quarter basis. Average loans increased $1.6 billion, or 9%, and the associated taxable-equivalent yield increased 4 basis points. All other average earning assets increased a net of $113.7 million, or 2%, versus the prior quarter. The yield on interest earning assets was 8 basis points higher at 4.22% compared to 4.14% in the prior quarter. The average cost of interest-bearing deposits rose 4 basis points to 65 basis points compared to 61 basis points in the prior quarter.\nThe increase in average earning assets and higher loan yields, offset by increases in average interest-bearing liabilities and costs of deposits, resulted in net increases on a linked quarter basis to the Company's reported and cash net interest margins of 5 and 4 basis points to 3.69% and 3.33%, respectively.\nThe Company's provision for loan losses decreased 22% to $14.4 million primarily due to a decline in net charge-offs. The provision for loan losses covered net charge-offs in 4Q17 by 142% compared to 64% in 3Q17.\nIn the fourth quarter of 2017, non-interest income increased $1.6 million compared to the third quarter of 2017. The primary changes in non-interest income on a linked quarter basis were increased treasury management and customer swap commission income of $1.2 million, or 18%, increased deferred COLI income of $1.0 million, or 351%, and decreased mortgage income of $2.4 million, or 15%, of which $1.5 million was volume/mix-related and $0.9 million was margin-related.\nNon-interest expense decreased $18.6 million on a linked quarter basis primarily due to higher merger-related and professional services expenses incurred in 3Q17 related to the Sabadell acquisition and the Department of Housing and Urban Development (\"HUD\") lawsuit. The HUD lawsuit was settled on December 11, 2017, in the amount of $11.7 million, which was previously provided for in the second ($6.0 million) and third ($5.7 million) quarters of 2017.\nNon-interest expense in 4Q17 included $11.4 million in merger and conversion-related expenses, $1.5 million in compensation-related expense, $3.2 million in branch closure and other impairment expense, and $0.5 million in tax penalties and interest and storm-related expenses. Excluding these items, core non-interest expense increased $4.2 million, or 3%, primarily related to a full quarter of Sabadell expenses.\nThe efficiency ratio improved to 63.5% from 75.2% on a linked quarter basis, while the non-GAAP core tangible efficiency ratio decreased to 55.6% from 58.2%, over the same period.

The rate on average interest-bearing deposits in 4Q17 was 0.65%, while the cost of total deposits (including non-interest bearing deposits) was 0.46%, increases of 4 basis points and 2 basis points, respectively, compared to 3Q17. The increase in the cost of interest-bearing deposits was primarily driven by interest-rate sensitive money market deposits. Cycle-to-date deposit beta is 22% through December 31, 2017.\nOn a linked quarter basis, average borrowings increased $282.1 million, or 12%, and the cost of average borrowings was unchanged between periods. The cost of average total interest-bearing liabilities was 0.76% in 4Q17, an increase of 4 basis points over the linked quarter, primarily driven by the costs of deposits. Total funding costs, inclusive of non-interest-bearing deposits was 57 basis points in 4Q17, compared to 54 basis points in 3Q17.\nAsset Quality\nNon-performing assets (\"NPAs\") to total assets remained relatively flat at 64 basis points at December 31, 2017 compared to 63 basis points at the linked quarter-end. Accruing loans past due 30 to 89 days equated to 0.31% of total loans at December 31, 2017, compared to 0.30% at September 30, 2017.\nNet charge-offs totaled $10.1 million in 4Q17, down $18.7 million, or 65%, compared to 3Q17. Annualized net charge-offs equated to 0.20% of average loans in 4Q17, a 42 basis point decrease on a linked quarter basis.\nCapital Position\nAt December 31, 2017, the Company reported a non-GAAP tangible common equity ratio of 8.61%, down 7 basis points compared to September 30, 2017, and the preliminary Tier 1 leverage ratio was 9.36%, down 81 basis points compared to September 30, 2017. The Company's preliminary calculation of its total risk-based capital ratio at December 31, 2017, was 12.37%, down 40 basis points compared to September 30, 2017. The write-down of deferred tax assets in conjunction with the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act in December 2017 resulted in a 23 basis points decline in risk-based capital ratios.\nAt December 31, 2017, book value per common share was $66.17, down $0.57 per share, compared to September 30, 2017. Tangible book value per common share was $42.56, down $0.48 per share, compared to September 30, 2017. The 4Q17 write-down of deferred tax assets negatively impacted both book value and tangible book value by $0.95 per common share compared to the linked quarter. Based on the closing stock price of the Company's common stock of $82.05 per share on January 25, 2018, this price equated to 1.24 times December 31, 2017 book value per common share and 1.93 times December 31, 2017 tangible book value per common share.\nDividends On Capital Stock. The declaration of dividends is at the discretion of the Board of Directors. The following details the recent dividend declarations:\nCommon Stock.

Non-GAAP measures in this press release include, but are not limited to, descriptions such as core, tangible, and pre-tax pre-provision. These measures typically adjust GAAP performance measures to exclude the effects of the amortization of intangibles and include the tax benefit associated with revenue items that are tax-exempt, as well as adjust income available to common shareholders for certain significant activities or transactions that in management's opinion can distort period-to-period comparisons of the Company's performance. Transactions that are typically excluded from non-GAAP performance measures include realized and unrealized gains/losses on former bank owned real estate, realized gains/losses on securities, income tax gains/losses, merger-related charges and recoveries, litigation charges and recoveries, and debt repayment penalties. Management believes presentations of these non-GAAP financial measures provide useful supplemental information that is essential to a proper understanding of the operating results of the Company's core businesses. These non-GAAP disclosures should not be viewed as a substitute for operating results determined in accordance with GAAP, nor are they necessarily comparable to non-GAAP performance measures that may be presented by other companies. Reconciliations of GAAP to non-GAAP disclosures are presented in the supplemental tables at the end of this release. Please refer to the supplemental tables for these reconciliations.\nCaution About Forward-Looking Statements\nThis press release contains \" ,\" which may include forecasts of our financial results and condition, expectations for our operations and businesses, and our assumptions for those forecasts and expectations.
