Members of these groups frequently maintain roadblocks and may use violence towards travelers,” said the State Department.\nOverall, the State Department placed Mexico at the second of its four-stage travel advisory levels.\n“Exercise increased caution in Mexico due to crime ... violent crime, such as homicide, kidnapping, carjacking, and robbery, is widespread,” it said.\nThe advisory underscored the limitations that the U.S. government faces in providing emergency services in many areas of Mexico because U.S. government employees are prohibited from traveling to those areas.\nClashes between rival drug gangs contributed to a record number of murders in Mexico last year, according to official data, dealing a fresh blow to President Enrique Pena Nieto’s pledge to bring gang violence under control with presidential elections due in July 2018.\nIn recent months, about a dozen politicians, officials and candidates for elected office have been killed in states where there are struggles between criminal groups for the control of drug trafficking routes.\nReporting by Anthony Esposito; Editing by Simon Cameron-Moore\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-11T06:15:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-11T06:35:05.049+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
