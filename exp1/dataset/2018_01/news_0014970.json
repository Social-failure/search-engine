The bodies of two sailors were recovered from the ship while a third body was pulled from the sea near the vessel. The remaining 29 crew of the ship are presumed dead. \nIn a statement on Wednesday, the Ministry of Transport said the salvage team had located the wreck, which was at a depth of 115 meters (377 feet) under sea level, and were preparing to send underwater robots to explore it.

Strong winds pushed it away from the Chinese coast, where the incident happened, and into Japan’s exclusive economic zone. \nThe ship, which was carrying 136,000 tonnes or almost 1 million barrels of condensate - an ultra-light, highly flammable crude oil - sank after several explosions weakened the hull. \nOn Tuesday, Japan’s environment ministry said it does not see much chance that the spill will reach its shores.
