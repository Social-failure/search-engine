So far larger vessels have captured most of the upswing and hopefully this will give a further boost to the smaller sizes as well.\nDuring the last quarter of the year the Company delivered profitable results.\nOn January 23 rd we accepted delivery of the c/v Polar Argentina, which is the first of the two 3,800 TEU new buildings ordered together with our partners York Capital.

Insiders have decided, as has been the case since June 2016, to reinvest in full their cash dividends in new shares.”\nFinancial Summary\nYear ended December 31,\nThree-month period ended\nDecember 31,\n(Expressed in thousands of U.S. dollars, except share and per share data): 2016 2017 2016 2017 Voyage revenue $ 468,189 $ 412,433 $110,134 $ 100,618 Accrued charter revenue (1) $ (7,730) $ (11,204) $ (2,836) $ (2,752) Voyage revenue adjusted on a cash basis (2) $ 460,459 $ 401,229 $ 107,298 $ 97,866 Adjusted Net Income available to common stockholders (3) $ 115,120 $ 76,933 $23,039 $ 18,408 Weighted Average number of shares 77,243,252 100,527,907 81,498,030 107,661,705 Adjusted Earnings per share (3) $ 1.49 $ 0.77 $ 0.28 $ 0.17 Net Income / (Loss) $ 81,702 $ 72,876 $ (11,008) $ 2,670 Net Income / (Loss) available to common stockholders $ 60,639 $ 51,813 $ (16,274) $ (2,596) Weighted Average number of shares 77,243,252 100,527,907 81,498,030 107,661,705 Earnings / (Losses) per share $0.79 $ 0.52 $ (0.20) $ (0.02) (1) Accrued charter revenue represents the difference between cash received during the period and revenue recognized on a straight-line basis. In the early years of a charter with escalating charter rates, voyage revenue will exceed cash received during the period and during the last years of such charter cash received will exceed revenue recognized on a straight line basis.\n(2) Voyage revenue adjusted on a cash basis represents Voyage revenue after adjusting for non-cash \"Accrued charter revenue\" recorded under charters with escalating charter rates. However, Voyage revenue adjusted on a cash basis is not a recognized measurement under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (\"GAAP\"). We believe that the presentation of Voyage revenue adjusted on a cash basis is useful to investors because it presents the charter revenue for the relevant period based on the then current daily charter rates. The increases or decreases in daily charter rates under our charter party agreements are described in the notes to the \"Fleet List\" below.\n(3) Adjusted Net Income available to common stockholders and Adjusted Earnings per Share are non- GAAP measures. Refer to the reconciliation of Net Income to Adjusted Net Income.\nNon-GAAP Measures\nThe Company reports its financial results in accordance with U.S. GAAP. However, management believes that certain non- GAAP financial measures used in managing the business may provide users of these financial measures additional meaningful comparisons between current results and results in prior operating periods. Management believes that these non-GAAP financial measures can provide additional meaningful reflection of underlying trends of the business because they provide a comparison of historical information that excludes certain items that impact the overall comparability. Management also uses these non-GAAP financial measures in making financial, operating and planning decisions and in evaluating the Company's performance. The tables below set out supplemental financial data and corresponding reconciliations to GAAP financial measures for the three months and the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016. Non-GAAP financial measures should be viewed in addition to, and not as an alternative for, voyage revenue or net income as determined in accordance with GAAP. Non-GAAP financial measures include (i) Voyage revenue adjusted on a cash basis (reconciled above), (ii) Adjusted Net Income available to common stockholders and (iii) Adjusted Earnings per Share.\nReconciliation of Net Income to Adjusted Net Income available to common stockholders\nand Adjusted Earnings per Share\nYear ended December 31, Three-month period ended\nDecember 31, (Expressed in thousands of U.S. dollars, except share and per share data) 2016 2017 2016 2017 Net Income / (Loss) $ 81,702 $ 72,876 $ (11,008) $ 2,670 Earnings allocated to Preferred Stock (21,063) (21,063) (5,266) (5,266) Net Income / (Loss) available to common stockholders 60,639 51,813 (16,274) (2,596) Accrued charter revenue (7,730) (11,204) (2,836) (2,752) Non-cash general and administrative expenses and non-cash other items 8,951 3,866 4,837 864 Amortization of prepaid lease rentals, net 6,779 8,429 2,200 2,054 Realized Gain on Euro/USD forward contracts (1) (898) (765) - (83) Loss on sale / disposals of vessels (1) 4,440 4,856 - - Loss on asset held for sale 37,161 2,379 37,161 2,379 Vessels’ impairment loss - 17,959 - 17,959 Vessel impairment loss by a jointly owned company with York included in equity (gain)/loss on investments - 896 - 896 Non-recurring, non-cash write-off of loan deferred financing costs 586 - - - Swap breakage cost 9,701 - 297 - Gain on derivative instruments, excluding interest accrued and realized on non-hedging derivative instruments (1) (4,509) (1,296) (2,346) (313) Adjusted Net Income available to common stockholders $ 115,120 $ 76,933 $ 23,039 $ 18,408 Adjusted Earnings per Share $ 1.49 $ 0.77 $ 0.28 $ 0.17 Weighted average number of shares 77,243,252 100,527,907 81,498,030 107,661,705 Adjusted Net Income available to common stockholders and Adjusted Earnings per Share represent Net Income after earnings allocated to preferred stock, but before non-cash \"Accrued charter revenue\" recorded under charters with escalating charter rates, realized gain on Euro/USD forward contracts, loss on sale / disposal of vessels, loss on asset held for sale, vessels’ impairment loss, vessel impairment loss by a jointly owned company with York included in equity (gain)/loss on investments, non-recurring, non-cash write-off of loan deferred financing costs, swap breakage cost, non-cash general and administrative expenses and non-cash other items, amortization of prepaid lease rentals, net and non-cash changes in fair value of derivatives. \"Accrued charter revenue\" is attributed to the timing difference between the revenue recognition and the cash collection. However, Adjusted Net Income available to common stockholders and Adjusted Earnings per Share are not recognized measurements under U.S. GAAP. We believe that the presentation of Adjusted Net Income available to common stockholders and Adjusted Earnings per Share are useful to investors because they are frequently used by securities analysts, investors and other interested parties in the evaluation of companies in our industry. We also believe that Adjusted Net Income available to common stockholders and Adjusted Earnings per Share are useful in evaluating our ability to service additional debt and make capital expenditures. In addition, we believe that Adjusted Net Income available to common stockholders and Adjusted Earnings per Share are useful in evaluating our operating performance and liquidity position compared to that of other companies in our industry because the calculation of Adjusted Net Income available to common stockholders and Adjusted Earnings per Share generally eliminates the effects of the accounting effects of capital expenditures and acquisitions, certain hedging instruments and other accounting treatments, items which may vary for different companies for reasons unrelated to overall operating performance and liquidity. In evaluating Adjusted Net Income available to common stockholders and Adjusted Earnings per Share, you should be aware that in the future we may incur expenses that are the same as or similar to some of the adjustments in this presentation. Our presentation of Adjusted Net Income available to common stockholders and Adjusted Earnings per Share should not be construed as an inference that our future results will be unaffected by unusual or non-recurring items.\n(1) Items to consider for comparability include gains and charges. Gains positively impacting Net Income are reflected as deductions to Adjusted Net Income. Charges negatively impacting Net Income are reflected as increases to Adjusted Net Income.\nResults of Operations\nThree-month period ended December 31, 2017 compared to the three-month period ended December 31, 2016\nDuring the three-month periods ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, we had an average of 52.6 and 53.0 vessels, respectively, in our fleet. In the three-month period ended December 31, 2017, we took delivery of the 2005-built, 2,556 TEU secondhand containership CMA CGM L’Etoile . In the three-month periods ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, our fleet ownership days totaled 4,843 and 4,876 days, respectively. Ownership days are one of the primary drivers of voyage revenue and vessels' operating expenses and represent the aggregate number of days in a period during which each vessel in our fleet is owned.\n(Expressed in millions of U.S. dollars,\nexcept percentages) Three-month period\nended December 31, Percentage\n201 6 201 7 Change Change Voyage revenue $ 110.1 $ 100.6 $ (9.5) (8.6 %) Voyage expenses (0.4) (0.6) 0.2 50.0 % Voyage expenses – related parties (0.8) (0.8) - - Vessels’ operating expenses (26.1) (26.9) 0.8 3.1 % General and administrative expenses (1.5) (1.3) (0.2) (13.3 %) Management fees – related parties (4.2) (4.3) 0.1 2.4 % Non-cash general and administrative expenses and non-cash other items (4.8) (0.9) (3.9) (81.3 %) Amortization of dry-docking and special survey costs (2.0) (1.8) (0.2) (10.0 %) Depreciation (25.2) (23.8) (1.4) (5.6 %) Vessels’ Impairment loss - (18.0) 18.0 n.m.

The decrease is mainly attributable to decreased charter rates for certain of our vessels and revenue not earned by four vessels sold for demolition which was partly offset by revenue earned by four secondhand vessels acquired during the second and fourth quarters of 2017.\nVoyage revenue adjusted on a cash basis (which eliminates non-cash \"Accrued charter revenue\"), decreased by 8.9%, or $9.5 million, to $97.8 million during the three-month period ended December 31, 2017, from $107.3 million during the three-month period ended December 31, 2016. Accrued charter revenue for both three-month periods ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, amounted to $2.8 million.\nVoyage Expenses\nVoyage expenses were $0.6 million and $0.4 million for the three-month periods ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Voyage expenses mainly include (i) off-hire expenses of our vessels, mostly related to fuel consumption and (ii) third party commissions.\nVoyage Expenses – related parties\nVoyage expenses – related parties in the amount of $0.8 million during each of the three-month periods ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, represent fees of 0.75% in the aggregate on voyage revenues charged by Costamare Shipping Company S.A. (\"Costamare Shipping\") and by Costamare Shipping Services Ltd. (\"Costamare Services\") pursuant to the Framework Agreement between Costamare Shipping and us dated November 2, 2015 (the “Framework Agreement”), the Services Agreement between Costamare Services and our vessel-owning subsidiaries dated November 2, 2015 (the “Services Agreement”) and the individual ship-management agreements pertaining to each vessel.\nVessels’ Operating Expenses\nVessels' operating expenses, which also include the realized gain / (loss) under derivative contracts entered into in relation to foreign currency exposure, were $26.9 million and $26.1 million during the three-month periods ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses\nGeneral and administrative expenses were $1.3 million and $1.5 million during the three-month periods ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively and both include $0.63 million which is part of the annual fee that Costamare Services receives based on the Services Agreement.\nManagement Fees – related parties\nManagement fees paid to our managers pursuant to the Framework Agreement were $4.3 million during the three-month period ended December 31, 2017 and $4.2 million during the three-month period ended December 31, 2016.\nNon-cash general and administrative expenses and non-cash other items\nNon-cash general and administrative expenses and non-cash other items for the three-month period ended December 31, 2017 amounted to $0.9 million, representing the value of the shares issued to Costamare Services on December 29, 2017, pursuant to the Services Agreement. For the three-month period ended December 31, 2016, the respective amount was $4.8 million, including the value of the shares issued to Costamare Services on December 31, 2016, pursuant to the Services Agreement.\nAmortization of Dry-docking and Special Survey Costs\nAmortization of deferred dry-docking and special survey costs was $1.8 million and $2.0 million during the three-month periods ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. During the three-month period ended December 31, 2017, three vessels underwent and completed their special survey. During the three-month period ended December 31, 2016 no vessel underwent any special survey.\nDepreciation\nDepreciation expense decreased by 5.6% or $1.4 million, to $23.8 million during the three-month period ended December 31, 2017, from $25.2 million during the three-month period ended December 31, 2016. The decrease was mainly attributable to depreciation expense not charged during the three -month period ended December 31, 2017, due to the sale of five vessels during 2016 and the year ended December 31, 2017; partly offset by the depreciation charged during the three-month period ended December 31, 2017, due to the acquisition of four secondhand containerships.\nAmortization of Prepaid Lease Rentals, net\nAmortization of prepaid lease rentals, net was $2.1 million during the three-month period ended December 31, 2017. Amortization of prepaid lease rentals, net was $2.2 million during the three-month period ended December 31, 2016.\nVessels’ Impairment loss\nDuring the three-month period ended December 31, 2017, we recorded an impairment loss in relation to seven of our vessels in the amount of $18.0 million, in the aggregate.\nLoss on asset held for sale\nDuring the three-month period ended December 31, 2017, we recorded a loss on asset held for sale of $2.4 million, representing the expected loss from sale of one of our vessels during the next twelve month period. During the three-month period ended December 31, 2016, we recorded a loss on asset held for sale of $37.2 million, representing the expected loss from sale for demolition of one of our vessels, which was sold in January 2017.\nInterest Income\nInterest income amounted to $0.8 million and $0.5 million for the three-month periods ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.\nInterest and Finance Costs\nInterest and finance costs decreased by 6.8%, or $1.2 million, to $16.5 million during the three-month period ended December 31, 2017, from $17.7 million during the three-month period ended December 31, 2016. The decrease is partly attributable to the decreased average loan balance during the three-month period ended December 31, 2017 compared to the three-month period ended December 31, 2016.\nSwaps Breakage Cost\nDuring the three-month period ended December 31, 2016, we terminated one interest rate derivative instrument that did not qualify for hedge accounting and we paid the counterparty breakage costs of $0.3 million.\nEquity Gain on Investments\nDuring the three-month period ended December 31, 2017, we recorded an equity gain on investments of $0.9 million representing our share of the net gain of 18 jointly owned companies pursuant to the Framework Deed dated May 15, 2013, as amended and restated on May 18, 2015 (the “Framework Deed”), between the Company and a wholly-owned subsidiary on the one hand, and York Capital Management Global Advisors LLC and an affiliated fund (collectively, together with the funds it manages or advises, “York”) on the other hand. During the three-month period ended December 31, 2016, we recorded an equity gain on investments of $0.4 million.\nGain / (Loss) on Derivative Instruments\nThe fair value of our 17 interest rate derivative instruments which were outstanding as of December 31, 2017 equates to the amount that would be paid by us or to us should those instruments be terminated. As of December 31, 2017, the fair value of these 17 interest rate derivative instruments in aggregate amounted to a net asset of $1.1 million.

The decrease is mainly attributable to (i) decreased charter rates for certain of our vessels, (ii) revenue not earned by five vessels sold for demolition (one vessel in August 2016 and four vessels during the year ended December 31, 2017) and (iii) revenue not earned due to decreased calendar days by one day during the year ended December 31, 2017 (365 calendar days) compared to the year ended December 31, 2016 (366 calendar days); partly offset by revenue earned by four secondhand vessels acquired during the second and fourth quarter of 2017.\nVoyage revenue adjusted on a cash basis (which eliminates non-cash \"Accrued charter revenue\"), decreased by 12.9%, or $59.3 million, to $401.2 million during the year ended December 31, 2017, from $460.5 million during the year ended December 31, 2016.

The decrease was mainly attributable to depreciation expense not charged during the year ended December 31, 2017, due to the sale of five vessels during the period spanning from the third quarter of 2016 to the year ended December 31, 2017; partly offset by the depreciation charged on the four secondhand containerships acquired during the second and fourth quarter of 2017.\nAmortization of Prepaid Lease Rentals, net\nAmortization of prepaid lease rentals, net was $8.4 million during the year ended December 31, 2017.
