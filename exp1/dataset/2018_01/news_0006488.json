Soccer Football - FA Cup Third Round - Manchester United vs Derby County - Old Trafford, Manchester, Britain - January 5, 2018 Manchester United's Romelu Lukaku scores their second goal REUTERS/Andrew Yates \n”He’s a good professional and a fantastic kid in the dressing room. \n“I was feeling that we were close to scoring and we never stopped trying. But when you get past 80 minutes and the goal hasn’t come, you fear the second match. But the team kept trying so I knew the goal could arrive.” Slideshow (2 Images) \nUnited had missed a string of chances as Lingard hit the post with a fierce arrowed shot several minutes before he broke the deadlock and Marcus Rashford also found the woodwork with a glancing header in the opening half. \nCarson kept out an array of stinging long range efforts, including three from Paul Pogba as United struggled to find a way through a resolute and well-organized visiting defense. \nPinned back for much of the contest, Derby launched several dangerous raids as defender Marcus Olsson and midfielder Tom Lawrence came close for the Rams, who finally cracked in the closing stages. \nCarson was left clutching thin air as Lingard unleashed a swiveling shot into the top left corner from 18 meters and with Derby throwing caution to the wind, Lukaku raced clear to score his 16th goal for United in all competitions.
