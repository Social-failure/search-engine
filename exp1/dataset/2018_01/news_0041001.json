It was last up 0.79 percent at $1.2504.\nDraghi warned that the surge in the euro was a source of uncertainty and said the ECB might have to review strategy if U.S. comments on the benefits of a weak dollar lead to a change in monetary conditions.\nThe dollar had slipped against the euro on Wednesday after U.S. Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin said he welcomed a weaker greenback.\nSome market participants had been expecting Draghi to take a firmer stance addressing the euro’s potentially damaging surge against the dollar.\n“Overall, the comments regarding the exchange rate were benign,” said Eric Viloria, currency strategist at Wells Fargo Securities in New York.\n“There was a lack of any forceful comments with respect to the recent euro strength,” he said.\nThe dollar index .DXY, which measures the greenback against a basket of six major currencies, was down 0.71 percent at 88.575, after dropping as low as 88.438, its lowest since December 2014.\nFILE PHOTO: A bank employee holds a pile of 500 euro notes at a bank branch in Madrid January 13, 2011.
