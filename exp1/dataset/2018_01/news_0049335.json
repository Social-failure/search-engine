Ten of Okogie’s game-high 26 points came in the final 2:33.\nAfter trailing by two at intermission, Clemson grabbed the lead early in the second half on a three-point play from Elijah Thomas. The Tigers never trailed again, but couldn’t put away the Yellow Jackets until the final minute.\nReed hit a layup that put Clemson ahead 68-60 with four minutes left. Okogie led Georgia Tech back, scoring 10 straight points, including a pair of free throws that tied the score, 70-70, with 42 seconds to play.\nReed hit another layup on the Tigers’ next possession, and Okogie misfired on Georgia Tech’s final attempt to end the Yellow Jackets’ comeback hopes.\nAbdoulaye Gueye had 14 points and eight rebounds, and Ben Lammers added 10 points and nine boards for the Yellow Jackets, who lost their fourth straight game.\nClemson now sits in a tie for third place in the ACC with Duke, a half-game behind second-place Louisville. The Tigers return home to host No. 10 North Carolina on Tuesday.\nGeorgia Tech will try to bounce back at home against Syracuse on Wednesday.\n--Field Level Media\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-01-29T10:03:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-29T21:59:12.012+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
