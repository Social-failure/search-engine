The Sabine Pass LNG terminal includes existing infrastructure of five LNG storage tanks with aggregate capacity of approximately 16.9 billion cubic feet equivalent (Bcfe), two marine berths that can accommodate vessels with nominal capacity of up to 266,000 cubic meters and vaporizers with regasification capacity of approximately 4.0 Bcf/d. Through its wholly owned subsidiary, Cheniere Creole Trail Pipeline, L.P., Cheniere Partners also owns a 94-mile pipeline that interconnects the Sabine Pass LNG terminal with a number of large interstate pipelines.\nCheniere Partners, through its subsidiary, Sabine Pass Liquefaction, LLC (\"SPL\"), is developing, constructing and operating natural gas liquefaction facilities at the Sabine Pass LNG terminal adjacent to the existing regasification facilities.
