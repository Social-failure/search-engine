The discounted student monthly rate will also increase, but the cost of yearly memberships will stay the same at $99.\n\"Costco, Netflix , Amazon Prime. Three things I don't look at my bill,\" Cramer said on \" Squawk on the Street \" moments after the news. \"I don't care. It doesn't matter.\"\nCramer believes the bump in the rate by Amazon is a small price to pay to use a service that he says is adored worldwide.\nAmazon's Prime service grants several perks for its users, including faster shipping and access to Amazon Video.\nLate last year, Netflix raised the monthly price of its popular streaming plan by $1 to $11 a month.\n\"My Amazon bill, my Netflix bill. Raise it,\" said Cramer, host of CNBC's \" Mad Money .\" \"Raise it because I love those services and so does the world.\"\n\"This flows just right to the bottom line,\" he added.\nAmazon issued a statement Friday that said in part, \"Prime provides an unparalleled combination of shipping, shopping and entertainment benefits\" adding \"we continue to invest in making Prime even more valuable for our members.\"\nâ€” CNBC's Sara Salinas contributed to this report.\nMorning Squawk: CNBC's before the bell news roundup Sign up to get Morning Squawk each weekday\nJob Industry Advertising/Marketing Automotive Communications/PR Construction/Manufacturing Education Finance/Banking/Insurance Legal Media/Entertainment Medical/Health Care Mining/Oil/Gas/Utilities Gov't/Non-Profit Real Estate Retail Technology/IT Transportation/Shipping Travel/Hospitality Other Get this delivered to your inbox, and more info about about our products and service.
