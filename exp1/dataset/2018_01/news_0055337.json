However, daytime sleepiness was tied to lower student-teacher closeness regardless of age and sex.\n“We do not have the data to specifically explain why, but . . . children who are sleepy during the day may be more muted, less engaged and less likely to have the positive interactions with teachers,” study co-author Alex Holdaway of Cincinnati Children’s Hospital Medical Center in Ohio told Reuters Health by email.\nHoldaway and co-author Stephen Becker acknowledge a number of study limitations, including that the findings are drawn from self-reported data from mainly Caucasian children.\nFurthermore, the study can’t prove that sleep deficiencies result in greater student-teacher conflict and less closeness, or whether the reverse is true - that difficulties with teachers impact a student’s sleep, Holdaway said.\nRich agreed, noting in an email, “If there were conflict at school with their teacher - one of their most important relationships and certainly where they spend a majority of their waking hours - would that not affect sleep?”\nThe findings are preliminary, and it’s impossible to say with certainty that more sleep will improve student-teacher conflict, “but ensuring your child gets adequate sleep is never a bad place to start,” Holdaway said.\nSOURCE: bit.ly/2FuVUcw Sleep Medicine, online December 20, 2017.\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-31T19:02:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-31T19:20:40.006+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
