But he backed away from both those options as he prepares to step down next year \n“We have no intention of breaking it up” and selling parts of the business to Chinese or other buyers, Marchionne said at a news conference at the Detroit auto show. \nThe outspoken CEO, who once touted the idea of joining forces with General Motors Co. to boost profitability and cut excess production, said that is no longer something he is interested in pursuing. “The merger [talk] is done. That’s history, that’s three years ago,” he said. \nThe about-face leaves Fiat Chrysler’s FCAU, -0.13% future unclear, though he promised Monday to unveil a new strategic plan on June 1 ahead of his resignation early next year.
