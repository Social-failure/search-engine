Both deals will help clear a path for Westinghouse to emerge from bankruptcy. \nThe sale of the claims and a new share issue worth 600 billion yen to overseas funds have helped Toshiba avoid falling into negative net worth for a second consecutive year, allowing it to remain a listed company. \nThe funds have also meant that it faces less pressure to complete the sale of the chip unit to a consortium led by U.S. private equity firm Bain Capital and some shareholders are pushing Toshiba to reconsider. \nToshiba, however, is sticking with its efforts to complete the sale of the chip unit by the end of March, saying it needs to further bolster the capital base. \n($1 = 110.9300 yen)", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-01-23T12:11:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-23T06:25:17.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
