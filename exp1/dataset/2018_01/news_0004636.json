The decision was made on Dec. 19, but was not made public until Wednesday.\nIn 2016, Norwegian exports of weapons and ammunition to the UAE rose to 79 million Norwegian crowns ($9.7 million) from 41 million in 2015, Statistics Norway data showed.\nHuman rights groups and several members of Norway’s parliament have for months campaigned for a halt in arms exports to the UAE.\n“It is fantastic that the government finally has taken responsibility to end weapons exports to a country which is active in the bombing of schools and hospitals in Yemen,” said Line Hegna, a spokeswoman for the Norwegian branch of rights group Save the Children.\n“Furthermore, we are hopeful that the decision taken by the Norwegian government can act as an example for other exporting nations to act responsibly in the face of repeated violations of international humanitarian law,” she added.\nThe sale of arms to Saudi Arabia and other coalition members has also stirred debate in other European countries, including Britain. Last July, London’s High Court rejected a claim by campaigners that billions of dollars’ worth of arms sales to Saudi Arabia should be halted because they were being used in Yemen in violation of international humanitarian law.\nA spokesperson for the Department for International Trade said on Wednesday that the British government “operates one of the most robust arms export control regimes in the world”.\n“We rigorously examine every application, including those from the UAE, on a case-by-case basis against the Consolidated EU and National Arms Export Licensing Criteria. We will not grant a license if to do so would be inconsistent with these criteria,” the spokesperson said.\nThe opposition Labour party, however, said it would continue to call for the suspension of all British arms sales to Saudi Arabia “until there is evidence of a complete halt to the use of British weapons against any civilian population”.\nWhile weapons exports to the UAE have been allowed since 2010, Norway does not permit sale of arms or ammunition to Saudi Arabia.\nThe Norwegian parliament’s foreign relations committee is due to debate the country’s arms sales later this month.\nUAE officials were not immediately available for comment.\n($1 = 8.1228 Norwegian crowns)\nReporting by Terje Solsvik; Additional reporting by William James in London and Sami Aboudi in Dubai; Editing by Catherine Evans\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-03T10:41:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-03T10:54:49.021+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
