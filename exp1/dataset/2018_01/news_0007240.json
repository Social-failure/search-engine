He has been relentless in his advocacy for his father and the agenda that has helped turn our country around,” Bannon said in a statement released on Sunday, adding that his comments were directed at Paul Manafort, Trump’s former campaign manager, and not aimed at the president’s son.\n“I regret that my delay in responding to the inaccurate reporting regarding Don Jr. has diverted attention from the president’s historical accomplishments in the first year of his presidency,” Bannon said.\nReporting by Jeff Mason; Editing by Howard Goller\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-07T19:58:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-07T20:23:08.020+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
