The police arrested four people with bags of flour, the report added. \nThere has been an increase in looting and scattered protests in the South American OPEC member in the last few weeks, as a fourth straight year of painful recession and the world’s highest inflation leaves millions short of food. \nCritics blame President Nicolas Maduro for Venezuela’s economic mess, saying he has persisted with failed statist policies for too long while turning a blind eye to rampant corruption and suffering. \nHis leftist government says it is the victim of an “economic war” by political opponents and business-friendly foreign powers, intent on bringing down Maduro in a coup to get their hands on Venezuelan oil reserves. \nIn what they said was an attempt to combat “speculation,” authorities last week forced over 200 supermarkets to slash prices, creating chaos as desperate Venezuelans leapt at the chance to buy cheaper food. \nBut the measure has left some supermarkets devoid of many fruits and vegetables, with employees saying they are not sure if the merchandise will be replenished. \nPoor Venezuelans have been forced to survive on cheap starches, cut back on meals, scavenge through garbage, or beg in front of supermarkets and bakeries. \nMalnutrition is on the rise, especially among children, and Maduro’s opponents warn the situation is set to become more dire this year.
