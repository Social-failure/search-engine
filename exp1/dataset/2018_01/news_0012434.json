But at the same time our democracies must completely protect the rule of law,” Macron said in a joint news conference. \nMacron also said that recent developments in Turkey did not allow for any progress in Ankara’s EU accession process. It would be hypocritical to pretend new chapters in the accession talks could be opened, he said. \nA security crackdown in Turkey after a failed coup in July 2016 has drawn criticism from human rights campaigners as well as the European Union, which is overseeing Ankara’s stalled bid to join the bloc.

They water ... from their columns on newspapers,” Erdogan said. “And one day, you find, these people show up as a terrorist in front of you.” \nThe Turkish leader was visibly irritated when a French journalist suggested that Turkish intelligence had sent arms to Syria. \nErdogan said the operation had been conducted by supporters of Fethullah Gulen, the U.S.-based cleric blamed by Turkish authorities for orchestrating the failed coup, and accused the French journalist of speaking like one of them.
