(NASDAQ:FSFG) (the \"Company\"), the holding company for First Savings Bank (the \"Bank\"), today reported net income of $3.4 million, or $1.44 per diluted share, for the three months ended December 31, 2017 compared to net income of $2.3 million, or $1.00 per diluted share, for the three months ended December 31, 2016. During the three months ended December 31, 2017, the Company recognized merger related expenses of $83,000, net of taxes, associated with its pending acquisition of The First National Bank of Odon, as well as an income tax benefit from the adjustment of deferred taxes as a result of the recently enacted Federal tax reform legislation. Excluding the merger related expenses, net of tax, and adjustment to deferred taxes, the Company would have reported net income of $3.4 million (non-GAAP measure) (1) and net income per diluted share of $1.43 (non-GAAP measure) (1) .\nNet interest income increased $1.1 million for the three months ended December 31, 2017 as compared to the same period in 2016. Interest income increased $1.4 million when comparing the two periods due primarily to an increase in the average balance of interest-earning assets of $114.7 million, from $744.6 million for 2016 to $859.3 million for 2017, and an increase in the average tax-equivalent yield, from 4.49% for 2016 to 4.52% for 2017. Interest expense increased $351,000 due to an increase in the average balance of interest-bearing liabilities of $80.9 million, from $628.4 million for 2016 to $709.3 million for 2017, and an increase in the average cost of interest-bearing liabilities, from 0.65% for 2016 to 0.77% for 2017.\nThe Company recognized $462,000 in provision for loan losses for the three months ended December 31, 2017, due primarily to an increase of $31.0 million in the loan portfolio, as compared to $306,000 of provision for loan losses recognized for the same period in 2016. Nonperforming loans, which consist of nonaccrual loans and loans over 90 days past due and still accruing interest, decreased $945,000, from $3.9 million at September 30, 2017 to $3.0 million at December 31, 2017. The Company recognized net charge-offs of $43,000 for the three months ended December 31, 2017 as compared to net charge-offs of $9,000 for the same period in 2016.\nNoninterest income increased $1.0 million for the three months ended December 31, 2017 as compared to the same period in 2016. The increase was due primarily to increases in the net gain on sale of loans guaranteed by the U.S. Small Business Administration (“SBA”) and the net gain on trading account securities of $685,000 and $432,000, respectively. The net gain on sales of loans guaranteed by the SBA was $1.5 million for the three months ended December 31, 2017 as compared to $854,000 for the same period in 2016. The net gain on trading account securities was $150,000 for the three months ended December 31, 2017 as compared to a net loss of $282,000 for the same period in 2016.\nNoninterest expense increased $842,000 for the three months ended December 31, 2017 as compared to the same period in 2016. The increase was due primarily to an increase in compensation and benefits of $470,000 attributable to the addition of new employees to support the Company’s SBA lending activities as well as normal salary and benefits adjustments.\nThe Company recognized income tax expense of $622,000 for the three months ended December 31, 2017, for an effective tax rate of 15.1%, as compared to income tax expense of $681,000, for an effective tax rate of 22.6%, for the same period in 2016. The decrease in the effective tax rate was due to the $122,000 benefit from the revaluation of net deferred tax liabilities during the quarter and a reduction in the Company’s statutory income tax rate resulting from the recently enacted Federal tax reform legislation. The adjustment to deferred taxes is provisional and subject to further revision.\n(1) Non-GAAP net income and net income per diluted share excludes certain nonrecurring items. A reconciliation to GAAP and discussion of the use of non-GAAP measures is included in the table below.\nComparison of Financial Condition at December 31, 2017 and September 30, 2017\nTotal assets increased $39.1 million, from $891.1 million at September 30, 2017 to $930.2 million at December 31, 2017. Loans increased $31.0 million due primarily to continued growth in the commercial real estate and SBA loan portfolios. Total deposits increased $6.1 million due primarily to increases in interest-bearing deposit accounts and noninterest-bearing deposit accounts of $4.9 million and $1.2 million, respectively, and despite a $23.8 million decrease in brokered certificates of deposit. Borrowings from the Federal Home Loan Bank increased $31.9 million.\nStockholders’ equity increased $2.2 million, from $93.1 million at September 30, 2017 to $95.3 million at December 31, 2017, due to net income, less dividends, of $3.1 million, partially offset by a decrease of $1.0 million in accumulated other comprehensive income. At December 31, 2017, the Company and Bank were considered “well-capitalized” under applicable regulatory capital guidelines.\nFirst Savings Bank has fourteen offices in the Indiana communities of Clarksville, Jeffersonville, Charlestown, Sellersburg, New Albany, Georgetown, Corydon, Lanesville, Elizabeth, English, Leavenworth, Marengo and Salem. Access to First Savings Bank accounts, including online banking and electronic bill payments, is available anywhere with internet access through the Bank's website at www.fsbbank.net .\nThis release may contain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws.
