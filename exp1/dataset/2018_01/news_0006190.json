Ten students from universities in Tehran and some other cities are in an uncertain position, and ... it is still unknown which body has detained them,\" the labour news agency ILNA quoted reformist politician Mahmoud Sadeghi as saying.\nIran has several parallel security bodies and residents say arrests are often not immediately announced.\nVideos that appeared on social media in recent days showed relatives of detainees gathering outside prisons seeking information about the fate of their loved ones.\nThe Revolutionary Guard and its affiliated Basij militia suppressed unrest in 2009, in which dozens of pro-reform Iranians were killed.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-07T13:20:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-07T12:57:49.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
