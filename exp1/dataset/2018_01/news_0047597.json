For the fourth quarter of 2017, Aquesta had unaudited net income of $204,000 (6 cents per share) compared to fourth quarter of 2016 net income of $529,000 (16 cents per share). For the twelve months ended December 31, 2017 net income was $1.9 million (58 cents per share) compared to the twelve months ended December 31, 2016 of $2.2 million (69 cents per share).\nThe decrease in Aquesta’s 2017 net income was due to a one-time tax adjustment relating to The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. Because of a change in tax rates, Aquesta booked a one-time decrease to its deferred tax asset and a corresponding increase of $404,000 to tax expense. The Tax Act lowered Aquesta’s federal corporate tax rate from 34% to 21%, which should result in reduced taxes and higher earnings going forward. Net Income for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017 excluding this one-time adjustment was $2.3 million, a new record for Aquesta earnings.\nJim Engel, CEO & President of Aquesta said, “I am pleased to announce continued excellent earnings excluding a one-time charge combined with excellent growth for the year. Our almost 22 percent loan growth for the year reflects positively on our people and our strategy. While this quarter’s net income was negatively impacted by the accounting adjustment resulting from Tax Reform, we believe the reduced tax expense going forward will quickly repay the adjustment.”\nKey Highlights\nLoan growth of $54.5 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017 or 21.7 percent Core deposit growth of $38.6 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017 or 18.8 percent Continued solid asset quality with low nonperforming loans and no foreclosed property Paid the fifth annual consecutive cash dividend to shareholders Purchase of the assets of Paladin Insurance Group, LLC located in Murrells Inlet, SC Expanded Aquesta’s South Carolina presence into the Charleston market\nSolid Balance Sheet Growth\nAt December 31, 2017, Aquesta’s total assets were $408.6 million compared to $353.1 million at December 31, 2016. Total loans were $305.3 million at December 31, 2017 compared to $250.8 million at December 31, 2016. Core deposits were $243.9 million at December 31, 2017 compared to $205.3 million at December 31, 2016.\nStrong Asset Quality\nAsset quality remains very strong. Nonperforming assets as of December 31, 2017 were at $27 thousand compared to $1.7 million as of December 31, 2016. Aquesta had $27 thousand in nonaccrual loans as of December 31, 2017 compared to $122 thousand in nonaccrual loans as of December 31, 2016. Aquesta had no foreclosed property at the end of 2017 compared to $1.5 million at the end of 2016.\nNet Interest Income\nNet interest income was $12.6 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017 compared to $11.0 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2016. This is an increase of $1.6 million or 14.1%. The increase in net interest income continues to be directly associated with Aquesta’s continued loan growth.\nNon Interest Income\nNon interest income was $3.8 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017 compared to $5.2 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2016. This decrease is primarily due to reduced gains on sales of investment securities and SBA loans.\nNon Interest Expense\nNon interest expense was $12.6 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017 compared to $12.6 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2016. Non interest expense stayed consistent even as Aquesta continues to expand. Personnel expense was at $8.0 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017 compared to $7.8 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2016.\nOccupancy expense decreased by $82 thousand for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017 compared to the twelve months ending December 31, 2016. The decrease in occupancy expense was due to the consolidation of the Wilmington bank branch and insurance agency offices. Aquesta had $60 thousand in OREO losses for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017 as compared to $243 thousand for the twelve months ending December 31, 2016.\nBelow are the following financial highlights for comparison:\nAquesta Financial Holdings, Inc.
