Thang also described it as “the policy of the politburo” - of which he was not a member at the time. \nThang told the court that his impatience had led to the violation of regulations. Only state-backed media are allowed into the court hearings, but other Vietnamese media are allowed to watch a video feed in an adjacent room. \nReuters was unable to contact former prime minister Dung for comment. \nScores of people have been arrested in the anti-graft campaign as the security establishment gained influence after Trong defeated Dung in a power struggle for the Communist Party’s top position in 2016. \nGovernment critics have noted that many of those detained had prospered under Dung’s administration. \nAmong the other officials on trial is Trinh Xuan Thanh, the former chairman of PetroVietnam Corruption, whose case grabbed world headlines last year when Germany accused Vietnam of kidnapping him from a Berlin park. \nThanh denied accusations made by witnesses in the court on Tuesday that he had handled bags of money sent as bribes to officials, the local VNexpress website reported. Thanh is accused over losses of more than $150 million. \nA document reviewed by Reuters last year showed that Thanh had been cleared of wrongdoing by the previous government.
