Domestic waste that has been sorted into plastics, glass, metals and card is left outside to be recycled in London, Britain August 14, 2017. REUTERS/Russell Boyce \nUnveiling a new environmental agenda which she said was now “centre stage”, May is keen to put divisions over leaving the European Union, scandals and an ill-judged election behind her and try to broaden the appeal of her Conservative Party. \nBut while welcomed, her moves to extend a 5 pence charge for a single-use plastic bag to all retailers, to have packaging-free aisles in supermarkets and to create a new Northern Forest were also criticised by some lawmakers for not going far enough. \nShe told an audience in west London that her party had made an important pledge “to make ours the first generation to leave the natural environment in a better state than we found it.” \n“As we leave the European Union which for decades has controlled some of the most important levers in environmental policy, now is the right time to put the question of how we project and enhance our natural environment centre stage.” \nAfter a shaky start to the year when a reshuffle of her top team of ministers fell flat, May wants to show that her premiership is more than just Brexit and has chosen environmental reform to try to win over voters.

Parliament’s environmental audit committee last week called for a 25 pence “latte levy” to be charged hot drinks.
