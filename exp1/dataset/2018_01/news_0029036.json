It said annual net profit rose to 108.1 million riyals ($29.7 million) from 91.3 million and proposed a dividend of 4.25 riyals per share, up from 3.5 riyals for 2016. \nMedicare Group, which has more than doubled since mid-November, rose 2.1 percent and Qatar International Islamic Bank gained 1.1 percent. But the Qatari market was mostly quiet. \nSaudi Arabia’s index was almost flat but National Medical Care rose 5.0 percent after saying it had signed a 300 million riyal ($80 million) contract to provide services for three years to GOSI, the Saudi social insurance agency. \nPetrochemical firm PetroRabigh surged 4.0 percent to its highest close since Auigust 2015 in heavy trade. \nDubai’s index fell 0.3 percent, with DAMAC Properties slipping 1.7 percent and amusement park operator DXB Entertainments losing 3.3 percent.
