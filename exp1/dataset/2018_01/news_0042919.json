It later pared some losses and was last down 0.1 percent at 110.16 yen.\nThe greenback has shed nearly 2.3 percent against the yen so far this month, putting it on track for its biggest monthly drop since January last year.\n“On the BOJ, they have just reaffirmed pretty much what we already know and what the market already knows, that they’ll continue to maintain an aggressive, powerful easing stance,” said Peter Dragicevich, G10 FX strategist for Nomura in Singapore.\nThat stance, however, has been factored in and market players are looking ahead to what the BOJ might do next, Dragicevich said.\n“They are looking at the next potential, kind of incremental steps, whenever they may come,” he added.\nAnalysts said the euro’s firm tone also helped weigh on the dollar.\nThe euro last changed hands at $1.2306, up 0.1 percent on the day and near a three-year high of $1.2323 set last week.\nEuro zone consumer confidence jumped much more than expected in January, data from the European Commission showed on Tuesday, helping to support the common currency.\nInvestors are also focusing on the European Central Bank’s meeting on Thursday for clues on the outlook for monetary policy.\nThe euro has rallied this year, boosted by growing optimism that a strengthening economy would prompt the ECB to signal a quicker end to years of efforts to stimulate the economy than previously forecast.
