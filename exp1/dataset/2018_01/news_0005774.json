It became the only province fully under opposition control.\nThe largest population gathering is in Eastern Idlib, the monitor said, expressing fears from further intensive civilian displacement in the coming few days due to the ongoing fighting.\nTens of thousands of rebels and civilians took refuge in Idlib after abandoning their homes in other parts of western Syria that the government and its foreign allies have retaken.\nThe fighting and air strikes have forced more than 60,000 people to leave their homes since Nov. 1, according to the U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA).\nThe United Nations said the civilians newly displaced by the fighting in Idlib were in a “dire” situation.\nReporting by Dahlia Nehme; editing by John Stonestreet\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-07T14:10:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-07T14:28:30.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
