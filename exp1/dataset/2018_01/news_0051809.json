So perhaps some pressure will help get us more progress to a more balanced economic, commercial relationship,” the chamber’s chairman William Zarit told reporters when asked about the possibility of Trump imposing further tariffs on China.\nForty-six percent of respondents listed either stronger advocacy for a level playing field or applying “investment reciprocity as an approach to improve market access” as the top two ways the U.S. government could help foreign businesses in China.\nThe third most common response, at 14 percent, was pursuing multilateral regional free trade and investment agreements, such as the Trans-Pacific Partnership deal from which the Trump administration withdrew.\nFifty-nine percent of companies in technology and research and development-intensive sectors, in which Beijing has unveiled an ambitious Made In China 2025 plan to supplant foreign products, said they were treated unfairly compared to domestic companies, according to the survey.\n“We see numerous policies that hamper foreign-invested companies, and also major market distortions being permitted in order to force technology transfer,” the chamber report cited an unidentified senior executive in the agribusiness sector as saying.\nReporting by Michael Martina; Additional reporting by Ben Blanchard; Editing by Richard Borsuk and Sam Holmes\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-30T03:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-30T03:49:07.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
