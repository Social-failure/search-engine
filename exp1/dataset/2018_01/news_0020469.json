REUTERS/Michael Kooren/File Photo ”I think it has to do with normal top sport injuries when you’re getting a little bit older. It gets harder to stay real fresh and you have injuries a little bit in your muscles. It takes longer to warm up.\n“It gets harder and harder when you get older. It’s nothing serious. She needs to work on it but she will be ready for the Olympics.”\nSEAL OF APPROVAL Former Olympic speed skating champion Bob de Jong, who raced in the Dutch teams with Wust at the last three Winter Olympics, is in no doubt she will challenge for medals again in Pyeongchang, South Korea.\n“It’s amazing how she can be focused on single races, focused on World Championships and during the Olympics,” he told Reuters from Seoul, where he is helping to coach the host nation.\n”If you see the results, all her prizes, it’s unbelievable what she wins. In the right moment she is more in shape than anybody else.\n”She uses a lot of power in her skating. That’s probably one of the reasons she can’t do it all season, but in the second part of the season, when the real prizes are, she is finally, every year, good.\n“It’s totally not easy to take a gold medal, but I‘m pretty sure she will take a medal over there and is good enough for gold. It wouldn’t surprise me,” he said.\nEditing by Peter Rutherford\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-01-15T22:06:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-16T13:19:29.008+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
