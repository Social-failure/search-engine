The United Nations described Myanmar’s crackdown as ethnic cleansing of the Rohingya, which Myanmar denies. \nGrandi said it was important to set in place a monitoring mechanism in Rakhine for those returning and noted the UNHCR currently did not have the ability to move freely and perform this role there. \nMyanmar and Bangladesh agreed earlier this month to complete a voluntary repatriation of the refugees in two years. Myanmar says it had set up two reception centres and a temporary camp near the border in Rakhine to receive the first arrivals.

REUTERS/Mohammad Ponir Hossain \nHuman Rights Watch, a non-government organisation, said on Tuesday that Bangladesh should suspend the plan entirely as it “threatens the refugees’ security and wellbeing”. \nThe plan has sparked fears in refugee camps in Bangladesh that people may be forced to return despite a lack of guarantees around their security. \n“We are not doing anything hurriedly. We are working hard to ensure their safe, dignified and sustainable return to their homeland. We’ll not send anyone until a conducive environment is created for them,” a Bangladeshi official, who participated in the repatriation talks with Myanmar, told Reuters on Tuesday.

He said the repatriation would take place five days a week, and then be reviewed after three months to see if it can be accelerated. \nMyanmar’s Social Welfare, Relief and Resettlement Minister Win Myat Aye said the repatriation would take place over the next two years, “or maybe less”. \n“Whoever is eligible, we will accept,” he said.
