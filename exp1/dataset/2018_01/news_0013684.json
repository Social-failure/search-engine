By midday Monday, the share price of Gem Diamond had risen more than 15 percent.\nClifford Elphick, Gem Diamonds' chief executive officer, said in a press release Monday that the discovery was a \"landmark recovery for all of Gem Diamonds' stakeholders.\"\nThe largest gem-quality rough diamond ever discovered is the 3106-carat Cullinan diamond that was discovered in South Africa's Premier Mine in 1905. It was cut into 105 diamonds including the 530-carat Great Star of Africa.\nThe largest cut diamond in the world is the Golden Jubilee Diamond, which weighs 545.67 carats.
