Analysts had on average expected earnings of 86 Canadian cents, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. \nRevenue rose 3.5 percent to C$3.63 billion. $1 = 1.2318 Canadian dollars Reporting by Alastair Sharp in Toronto and Ahmed Farhatha in Bengaluru; Editing by Maju Samuel and Martina D'Couto", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-25T15:47:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-25T16:08:20.005+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
