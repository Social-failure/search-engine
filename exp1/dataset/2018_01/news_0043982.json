Before that, Espinosa worked at the Inter-American Development Bank and Mexico’s prestigious ITAM university.\nThe central bank has been battling Mexico’s highest inflation in over 16 years. Although inflation slowed in the first half of January, the board is still expected to raise its benchmark lending rate in February.\nSeparately, Congress also approved the appointment of Miguel Messmacher as new deputy finance minister, and Alberto Torres Garcia as the new deputy minister for revenue.
