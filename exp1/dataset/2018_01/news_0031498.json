David Frank, CEO and Sterling McGregor, President, appeared before the commission with DealPoint Merrill’s legal counsel, Mr. Kenneth Fisher, who handled the project’s zoning matters.\nThe redevelopment project will undertake major interior construction and beautification of the surrounding Mall property. The project is scheduled to begin in the second quarter of 2018.\nFor more information visit our website at www.dealpointmerrill.com .\nView source version on businesswire.com : http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180118005322/en/\nDealPoint Merrill\nDanielle Watson, 310-671-3900\nCommunications\ndwatson@dealpointmerrill.com\nSource: DealPoint Merrill", "external_links": ["http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180118005322/en/", "http://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.dealpointmerrill.com&esheet=51744983&newsitemid=20180118005322&lan=en-US&anchor=www.dealpointmerrill.com&index=1&md5=951c7e5bedfda3144ea78df026310673"], "published": "2018-01-18T14:35:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-18T17:09:43.056+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
