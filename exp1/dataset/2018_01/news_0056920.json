Economic growth in Germany, Poland’s top exports market, hit a six-year high in 2017.\nBut some economists and policymakers say wage pressures are a concern.\nEconomists at Danske Bank said in a recent note that while Poland’s economy showed no signs of overheating, there were “dangers”.\n“The Polish labour market is red-hot,” they wrote, pointing to unemployment at record lows in post-Soviet history which spurs wage pressures. They also see Poland’s sustainable growth rate only at 2-3 percent.\nAdam Glapinski, the country’s top monetary policy maker known for his dovish stance, said on Tuesday that shortages in the labour market are the main concern for now when making rate decisions.\nAnalysts at Erste Group Research said on Tuesday that rising wages will pressure inflation to above the central bank’s target of 2.5 percent in the middle of the year, which may bring pressure on the Monetary Policy Council (MPC) to a rate hike.\n“So far, however, the MPC has been dovish,” the analysts wrote in a note.\nThe Polish central bank decided earlier this month to keep interest rates unchanged, with the key rate at record-low of 1.50 percent.
