Those advances have been followed up by an annual increase of more than 10 percent on 10 occasions during that time.\nCheck out the chart below:\n\"Historically, strong returns tend to be followed by strong returns in the subsequent year,\" Jonathan Golub, the bank's chief U.S. equity strategist, said in a note Tuesday.\nEquities had a banner year in 2017, with the S&P 500 rising 19.4 percent. Stocks got a boost last year from strong growth in corporate earnings, solid economic data and expectations for lower corporate taxes. Last month, President Donald Trump signed a bill that slashed the corporate tax rate in the U.S. to 21 percent from 35 percent.\nCredit Suisse was already bullish on U.S. stocks for 2018. Golub has a 3,000 target on the S&P 500 for this year. His target — along with his $155 earnings-per-share estimate — reflect \"better corporate results (primarily in TECH+, Energy and Materials), a pickup in GDP forecasts for the upcoming year, and recent tax changes,\" he said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-02T22:04:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-02T21:16:23.082+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
