There is no set date for when the agreement might be struck, or come into effect, the official said.\nIt was not immediately clear if the marshals would travel solely on U.S.-owned airlines or also on Mexican carriers.\nThe document shows that Mexico and the United States have agreed to several other security measures to tackle “transnational criminal organizations.”\nThe two countries plan to create a bilateral investigative body for probing international criminal groups.\nThere are also plans to negotiate a maritime drug seizures treaty, and use ships and radars for specific operations. The two nations also want to deepen efforts to eradicate opium and marijuana plantations.\nAdditionally, the document showed that Mexico and the United States agreed “to identify specific transnational criminal organizations, map their business models in both countries and design a joint operational strategy to combat them.”\nNAFTA CONCERNS The foreign ministry has pushed hard to defend NAFTA ahead of a July 2018 election in which the ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party is currently polling third.\nMexico, Canada and the United States are currently in the midst of fraught negotiations to reshape NAFTA, a lynchpin of the Mexican economy that Trump has threatened to abandon.\nTrump’s trade chief rejected Canadian proposals for unblocking NAFTA modernization talks on Monday but pledged to seek “breakthroughs” by late February, easing concerns that Washington would soon withdraw from the trilateral pact.\nMany in the Mexican government believe a U.S. NAFTA exit before the July election would strengthen the challenge of leftist front-runner Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, who some in Washington view as a threat to bilateral cooperation.\nForeign Minister Luis Videgaray said in September that he views cooperation with the United States as the best way to achieve Mexico’s foreign policy aims.\nMexico bolstered anti-narcotics collaboration last year as U.S. concern mounted over heroin-related deaths, inviting U.S. officials to inspect the army’s opium poppy eradication efforts. Mexico’s army has long been wary of U.S. intrusion in its affairs.\nMexico has also hewed closer to the United States on sensitive foreign policy issues including Venezuela, North Korea, Israel and Honduras.\nReporting by Gabriel Stargardter; editing by Diane Craft\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-30T02:55:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-30T03:07:44.058+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
