It was the third consecutive loss for the Irish, who lost starting guard D.J. Harvey to a possible knee injury during the first half. Notre Dame (13-6, 3-3 ACC) also played without guard Rex Pflueger for the final 16:47 after he fouled out late in the second half.\nThe Irish, who have also been without key senior Bonzie Colson for six straight games, kept things interesting despite their short bench. Farrell hit a 3-pointer with 1:16 left in the second OT to get Notre Dame within 80-78. But Snider, who earlier in the night became the 66th 1,000-point scorer in Louisville history, made a pair of free throws with 13 seconds left to seal the victory.\nSnider made 7 of 12 shots and added seven assists for Louisville (14-4, 4-1), which won for the 10th time in 12 games.\nThe Irish are now 3-3 without Colson, who broke a bone in his foot during a Jan. 4 practice. Colson averaged 21.4 points and 10.4 rebounds along with two steals and two blocks per game prior to the injury.\nFarrell slowed down after a hot start as he returned to the lineup after missing three-plus games with a sprained ankle. Farrell scored 15 first-half points, but finished making only 8 of 25 shots, including 4 of 14 3-pointers.\nMartinas Geben finished with 22 points and 17 rebounds in the losing effort for Notre Dame, which missed four consecutive game-winning tries in the final 40 seconds of regulation.\nLouisville forced the Irish into 18 turnovers. Notre Dame entered the game with the sixth-lowest average of turnovers committed (9.8) in the nation.\nThe Cardinals, who entered the contest with 34 runs of 8-0 or better this season, used a 19-2 run to grab a 35-28 lead early in the second half.\nDeng Adel finished with 14 points for Louisville.\n--Field Level Media\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-01-17T11:07:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-17T20:19:06.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
