(NYSE: YELP) (\"Yelp\" or the \"Company\") on behalf of purchasers of the Company's securities between February 10, 2017 and May 9, 2017 , inclusive (the \"Class Period\").\nInvestors who purchased Yelp securities during the Class Period may, no later than March 19, 2018, seek to be appointed as a lead plaintiff representative of the class. For additional information or to learn how to participate in this action please visit https://www.ktmc.com/new-cases/yelp-inc#join\nYelp investors who wish to discuss this action and their legal options are encouraged to contact Kessler Topaz Meltzer & Check, LLP (Darren J. Check, Esq., D. Seamus Kaskela, Esq. or Adrienne Bell, Esq.) at (888) 299-7706 or at info@ktmc.com .\nYelp operates a social networking, user review, and local search website. The Company provides the site as a guide for visitors to find reviews and details about local businesses.\nOn February 9, 2017, Yelp reported Fiscal 2016 financial and operational results, and provided a \"business outlook\" for Fiscal 2017. For Fiscal 2017, the Company reported that \"net revenue is expected to be in the range of $880 million to $900 million\" and that adjusted EBITDA \"is expected to be in the range of $150 million to $165 million.\"\nThe shareholder class action complaint alleges that Yelp and certain of its senior executive officers made false and misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that: (i) Yelp's transition from a Cost-Per-Thousand-Impressions (\"CPM\") to a Cost-Per-Click (\"CPC\") model in Fiscal 2016 created a distinct cohort of local advertisers that would reach the end of their contracts during the first part of Fiscal 2017; (ii) new customers that signed on with Yelp under the CPC pricing model had lower retention rates because the customers did not effectively compete with Yelp's more established customers; and (iii) that, as a result of the lower retention rates, Yelp was not on track to achieve its financial guidance or results during the Class Period.\nOn May 9, 2017, Yelp reported its First Quarter 2017 financial and operational results and reduced its Fiscal 2017 business outlook. Specifically, the Company announced that it had decreased its net revenue outlook for Fiscal 2017 down to $850 – $865 million from $880 – $900 million, and that it had decreased its adjusted EBITDA outlook for Fiscal 2017 down to $130 – $145 million from $150 – $165 million.\nFollowing this news, shares of the Company's stock declined $6.37 per share, or over 18.3%, to close on May 10, 2017 at $28.33 per share, on unusually heavy trading volume.\nInvestors who purchased Yelp securities during the Class Period may, no later than March 19, 2018 , seek to be appointed as a lead plaintiff representative of the class through Kessler Topaz Meltzer & Check, or other counsel, or may choose to do nothing and remain an absent class member. A lead plaintiff is a representative party who acts on behalf of all class members in directing the litigation. In order to be appointed as a lead plaintiff, the Court must determine that the class member's claim is typical of the claims of other class members, and that the class member will adequately represent the class in the action. Your ability to share in any recovery is not affected by the decision of whether or not to serve as a lead plaintiff.\nKessler Topaz Meltzer & Check prosecutes class actions in state and federal courts throughout the country. Kessler Topaz Meltzer & Check is a driving force behind corporate governance reform, and has recovered billions of dollars on behalf of institutional and individual investors from the United States and around the world. The firm represents investors, consumers and whistleblowers (private citizens who report fraudulent practices against the government and share in the recovery of government dollars).
