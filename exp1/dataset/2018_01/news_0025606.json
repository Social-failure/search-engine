State survived.\nYurtseven shot 12-for-18 from the field, including 5-for-6 on 3-pointers, in helping the Wolfpack avenge a loss from last month and putting an end to Clemson’s 10-game winning streak.\nAllerik Freeman added 14 points for N.C. State (12-5, 2-2 Atlantic Coast Conference), which conquered then-No. 2 Duke in its previous game.\nMarcquise Reed scored 17 points, while Donte Grantham had 16 points, Mark Donnal added 13 points and DeVoe chipped in 12 for Clemson (14-2, 3-1).\nThe outcome leaves Virginia as the only ACC team without a league loss.\nN.C. State also topped a No. 2 team in November when toppling Arizona, then turned around and lost its next two games.\nThis time, the Wolfpack broke a 50-50 tie with 11 consecutive points. Clemson broke its drought with 8:10 to play with what became a 7-0 spurt before the Wolfpack responded.\nBut a 73-61 margin was trimmed to 74-71 with 32.8 seconds to play. A turnover gave Clemson the ball, but the Tigers turned it over when Torin Dorn stole the inbounds pass and the Wolfpack held on.\nN.C. State called a timeout after DeVoe’s first two free throws and then he missed.\nClemson defeated the Wolfpack 78-62 on Dec. 30 at home.\nYurtseven had 15 first-half points, going 3-for-3 from 3-point range. He had 12 total points in the first meeting with Clemson.\nThe Tigers committed five turnovers in the first six minutes, aiding N.C. State’s strong start that resulted in a 24-15 lead. Yurtseven scored 10 straight for the Wolfpack during one stretch.\nClemson went up 34-33 with 3:23 left in the first half before the Wolfpack recovered for a 41-38 halftime edge.\nThe Tigers shot 58.3 percent in the first half, but they committed 10 turnovers compared to one giveaway by N.C. State.\nClemson entered the game with a 3-0 mark in ACC play for the first time in 11 years.\n--Field Level Media\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-01-12T12:44:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-12T18:53:44.016+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
