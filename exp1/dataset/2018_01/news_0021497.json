This has prompted companies such as Qualcomm to think about tapping overseas cash in new ways.\nQualcomm shares rose 4.3 percent to $68.19. Broadcom’s offer, unveiled on Nov. 6, valued Qualcomm at $70 per share. NXP was barely changed at $119.66, above the $110 Qualcomm bid.\nQualcomm is trying to show investors that Broadcom’s $103 billion cash-and-stock offer significantly undervalues the company.\nQualcomm forecast adjusted per share profit of $6.75 to $7.50 in 2019, on revenue of $35 billion to $37 billion. Analysts on average expected a profit of $3.79 per share on revenue of $23.59 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.\nThe company plans to achieve its new profit target through a new $1 billion cost reduction plan and by resolving current licensing disputes, including with Apple Inc ( AAPL.O ).\nThe $1 billion cost plan contrasts with Broadcom’s proposed $3 billion in annual cost cuts at Qualcomm. Qualcomm plans to reduce spending in four main areas, including selling, general and administrative expenses (SG&A). It also said it had already completed some of its 5G technology investments, which could lower spending in research and development.\nBroadcom responded on Tuesday by calling the plan “a transparent attempt to sell a quick fix by the Qualcomm board of directors and management team and an obvious tactic to deny its own stockholders the opportunity to receive a compelling premium.”\nBroadcom made its first formal move toward a hostile bid in December, laying out a slate of 11 nominees it wanted to put on Qualcomm’s board. Qualcomm has rejected the nominations, and its shareholders will be asked to vote on them in March.\nExcluding the royalty revenues and certain product revenues from Apple and other licensees in dispute, Qualcomm expects to earn $5.25 per share in 2019.\nReporting by Liana Baker in New York; Additional reporting by Muvija M and Aishwarya Venugopal in Bengaluru; Editing by Arun Koyyur and Richard Chang\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-16T16:57:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-16T17:21:38.015+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
