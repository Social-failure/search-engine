Wichita State has won 11 straight road games, the longest such streak in the nation.\nDown two with 25 seconds to play, Tulsa coach Frank Haith called timeout. Corey Henderson got a good look at 3-pointer from the right wing out of the timeout, but the shot rimmed out, forcing the Golden Hurricane to foul.\nShamet increased the Wichita State lead to 72-69 with one of two free throws with eight seconds left. The Shockers fouled to prevent Tulsa from getting up a potential tying 3-pointer, but were unable to coral the rebound off of a missed free throw.\nThe ball wound up in Sterling Taplin’s hands. He fired up a 3-pointer, but was just long as time expired.\nTaplin finished with a game-high 26 points, and Henderson added 14 points for Tulsa (10-8, 3-3 AAC), which has lost three straight games.\nShamet had 16 points for the Shockers, who have responded to a loss at home Oklahoma in mid-December with seven straight wins.\nWichita State (15-2, 5-0 AAC) led 36-32 at halftime and extended its lead to 54-44 on a layup by Darral Willis Jr. midway through the second half.\nTulsa, which was coming off a 33-point loss at Houston earlier in the week, wouldn’t go away and stayed close into the final minutes. Junior Etu converted a three-point play that cut Wichita State’s lead to 63-58 with 4:20 left in the game.\nTaplin drained his sixth 3-pointer get the Golden Hurricane within two with two minutes remaining, but couldn’t come up with one more big shot.\nThe Shockers return home to host SMU on Wednesday.\nTulsa is a Temple on Wednesday.\n-- Field Level Media\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-01-14T10:57:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-14T20:25:29.001+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
