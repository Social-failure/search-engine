( bit.ly/2BmCGTX ) \nWirecard rejected the report but its shares still closed 3.7 percent down on Tuesday, having dropped as much as 8 percent. \nThe initial Munich investigation was launched in 2016 after the stock took a battering from short-sellers when previously unknown Zatarra Research accused the company of misleading accounting and fraud, charges Wirecard has strongly denied.
