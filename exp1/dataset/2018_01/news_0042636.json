In Europe, Nordea Bank AB has banned its employees from trading Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. \nThere’s very little elasticity in the supply of Bitcoin, so every increase in demand directly results in an increase in price, the UBS chairman said. Weber called for regulators to “zoom in” on Bitcoin, which on Wednesday traded at $11,076, down from a high of $18,675 on Dec. 18. ‘Fake Currency’ \nBanking executives across Europe have expressed doubts about the cryptocurrency as an investment. Bitcoin is a “fake” currency and governments can’t accept a growing market of money not printed by a country, Russia’s VTB Bank PJSC management board Chairman Andrey Kostin also said in a Bloomberg Television Wednesday in Davos, adding that there’s “no big future” for Bitcoin. Credit Suisse Group AG Chief Executive Officer Tidjane Thiam said in November that Bitcoin is the “ very definition of a bubble.” \nOutside of cryptocurrencies, Weber also cited real estate in Switzerland and other countries as a potential bubble, adding that vacancy rates are increasing which will probably lead to some defaults on loans. That could lead to a “broader correction” in the real estate market, Weber said.
