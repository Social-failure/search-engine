For the year ended Dec. 31, 2017, the Company reported net income of $20.5 million, or $0.95 per diluted share. This compares to net income of $22.8 million, or $1.05 per diluted share, in 2016. The fourth quarter and full year 2017 results include a one-time increase in income tax expense of $6.0 million (or $0.28 per diluted share), as described below.\nOn Dec. 22, 2017, President Donald Trump signed into law H.R. 1, also known as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which among other things, reduced the federal corporate income tax rate to 21% effective Jan. 1, 2018. As a result, the Company concluded that its deferred tax assets, net (“DTA”) had to be revalued. The Company’s DTA represents expected corporate tax benefits anticipated to be realized in the future. The reduction in the federal corporate income tax rate reduces these anticipated future benefits. The revaluation of the Company’s DTA at Dec. 31, 2017 resulted in a reduction of these net assets and a corresponding increase in income tax expense of $6.0 million, which was recorded in the fourth quarter of 2017.\nThe fourth quarter of 2017 was highlighted by:\n31.1% and 29.6% increases in net income and diluted earnings per share, respectively, over the year ago quarter, when excluding the impact of the DTA revaluation. Growth in net interest income of $3.1 million, or 15.1%. Total portfolio loan growth of $81.7 million (representing a 16.7% annualized rate). Payment of a 12 cent per share dividend on Nov. 15, 2017. The announcement on Dec. 4, 2017 of the Company’s agreement to acquire TCSB Bancorp, Inc. (“TCSB”), the parent company of Traverse City State Bank.\nThe Company’s full year 2017 results were highlighted by:\n16.1% and 16.2% increases in net income and diluted earnings per share, respectively, over the prior year, when excluding the impact of the DTA revaluation. Growth in net interest income of $9.5 million, or 12.0%. Total portfolio loan growth of $410.6 million, or 25.5%. A $174.8 million, or 7.9%, increase in total deposits. A 6.2% increase in tangible book value per share to $12.34 at Dec. 31, 2017.\nWilliam B. (“Brad”) Kessel, the President and Chief Executive Officer of Independent Bank Corporation, commented: “We are very pleased with our fourth quarter and full year 2017 results. For 2017, our return on average assets and return on average equity were 0.77% and 7.82%, respectively. However, when excluding the $6.0 million (or $0.28 per diluted share) of income tax expense related to the revaluation of our net deferred tax assets, we achieved double digit percentage growth in net income and earnings per share and a 1.00% ROA and 10.1% ROE. A 1% or better ROA and a 10% or better ROE were goals that we established a couple of years ago. Strong loan origination activity led to significant loan growth and increased net interest income. As we move into 2018, we recognize the importance of improving our performance even further and successfully executing on our pending acquisition of TCSB. As an organization, we are committed to our efforts to continue strong loan and deposit growth as well as improved operating efficiencies. Reflecting our recent success and our optimism about the future, including the anticipated favorable impact of a reduced federal corporate income tax rate in 2018, we recently announced a 25% increase in our quarterly common stock cash dividend to 15 cents per share, to be paid on Feb 15, 2018.”\nOperating Results\nThe Company’s net interest income totaled $23.3 million during the fourth quarter of 2017, an increase of $3.1 million, or 15.1% from the year-ago period, and an increase of $0.4 million, or 1.8%, from the third quarter of 2017. The Company’s tax equivalent net interest income as a percent of average interest-earning assets (the “net interest margin”) was 3.65% during the fourth quarter of 2017, compared to 3.45% in the year-ago quarter and 3.66% in the third quarter of 2017. The year-over-year quarterly increase in net interest income is due to the increase in the net interest margin as well as an increase in average interest-earning assets. Average interest-earning assets were $2.57 billion in the fourth quarter of 2017 compared to $2.37 billion in the year-ago quarter and $2.52 billion in the third quarter of 2017.\nFor the full-year of 2017, net interest income totaled $89.2 million, an increase of $9.5 million, or 12.0% from 2016. This increase is due to increases in the net interest margin and average interest-earning assets. Average interest-earning assets totaled $2.47 billion in 2017 compared to $2.28 billion in 2016. The Company’s net interest margin for all of 2017 increased to 3.65% compared to 3.52% in 2016. This increase is primarily due to loan growth and a rise in short-term interest rates.\nNon-interest income totaled $11.4 million and $42.5 million, respectively, for the fourth quarter and full year of 2017, compared to $13.2 million and $42.3 million in the respective comparable year ago periods. The year-over-year quarterly decrease was primarily due to a decline in mortgage loan servicing income. The full year increase in 2017 compared to 2016 was primarily due to growth in service charges on deposit accounts, interchange income and net gains on mortgage loans that were partially offset by declines in net gains on securities available for sale, mortgage loan servicing income and other non-interest income.\nNet gains on mortgage loans were $2.9 million in the fourth quarter of 2017, compared to $2.8 million in the year-ago quarter. For the full year of 2017, net gains on mortgage loans totaled $11.8 million compared to $10.6 million in 2016. The quarterly and full year comparative increases in net gains relate primarily to higher mortgage lending and sales volumes due to the expansion of the Company’s mortgage banking operations and opening of new loan production offices in late 2016 and early 2017.\nMortgage loan servicing generated income of $1.0 million and $2.7 million in the fourth quarters of 2017 and 2016, respectively. For all of 2017, mortgage loan servicing generated income of $1.6 million as compared to income of $2.2 million in 2016. This activity is summarized in the following table:\nThree Months Ended Year Ended 12/31/2017 12/31/2016 12/31/2017 12/31/2016 Mortgage loan servicing: (Dollars in thousands) Revenue, net $ 1,138 $ 1,019 $ 4,391 $ 4,106 Fair value change due to price 356 -- (719 ) -- Fair value change due to pay-downs (515 ) -- (2,025 ) -- Amortization -- (785 ) -- (2,850 ) Impairment (charge) recovery -- 2,442 -- 966 Total $ 979 $ 2,676 $ 1,647 $ 2,222 Effective on Jan. 1, 2017, the Company adopted the fair value accounting method for capitalized mortgage loan servicing rights. Capitalized mortgage loan servicing rights totaled $15.7 million at Dec. 31, 2017 compared to $13.7 million at Dec. 31, 2016. As of Dec. 31, 2017, the Company serviced approximately $1.82 billion in mortgage loans for others on which servicing rights have been capitalized.\nNon-interest expenses totaled $23.1 million in the fourth quarter of 2017, compared to $24.9 million in the year-ago period. For the full year of 2017, non-interest expenses totaled $92.1 million versus $90.3 million in 2016. The fourth quarter and full year of 2017 included $0.3 million of expenses related to the pending TCSB acquisition. The fourth quarter and full year of 2016 included $2.3 million and $0.3 million related to the settlement of litigation and a loss on the sale of the Company’s former payment plan processing business assets, respectively.\nThe Company recorded an income tax expense of $9.5 million and $18.0 million in the fourth quarter and full-year of 2017, respectively. This compares to an income tax expense of $2.6 million and $10.1 million in the fourth quarter and full-year of 2016, respectively. The fourth quarter and full year 2017 income tax expense was increased by $6.0 million due to the DTA revaluation as described above. The full year 2016 income tax expense was reduced by a credit of approximately $0.3 million due to the adoption of Financial Accounting Standards Board Accounting Standards Update 2016-09 “Compensation – Stock Compensation (718) Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting” in the second quarter of that year.\nAsset Quality\nCommenting on asset quality, President and CEO Kessel added: “We continue to make progress in further improving asset quality, as evidenced by declines in non-performing loans and assets. In addition, thirty- to eighty-nine day delinquency rates at Dec. 31, 2017 were 0.002% for commercial loans and 0.41% for mortgage and consumer loans. These early stage delinquency rates continue to be well-managed.”\nA breakdown of non-performing loans (1) by loan type is as follows:\nLoan Type 12/31/2017 12/31/2016 12/31/2015 (Dollars in Thousands) Commercial $ 646 $ 5,163 $ 3,572 Consumer/installment 543 907 972 Mortgage 6,995 7,294 6,174 Payment plan receivables -- -- 5 Total $ 8,184 $ 13,364 $ 10,723 Ratio of non-performing loans to total portfolio loans 0.41 % 0.83 % 0.71 % Ratio of non-performing assets to total assets 0.35 % 0.72 % 0.74 % Ratio of the allowance for loan losses to non-performing loans 275.99 % 151.41 % 210.48 % (1) Excludes loans that are classified as “troubled debt restructured” that are still performing.\nNon-performing loans at Dec. 31, 2017 declined $5.2 million, or 38.8%, from Dec. 31, 2016. This decline primarily reflects the pay-off or liquidation of non-performing commercial loans. Other real estate and repossessed assets totaled $1.6 million at Dec. 31, 2017, compared to $5.0 million at Dec. 31, 2016.\nThe provision for loan losses was an expense of $0.4 million and $0.1 million in the fourth quarters of 2017 and 2016, respectively. The provision for loan losses was an expense of $1.2 million and a credit of $1.3 million for all of 2017 and 2016, respectively. The level of the provision for loan losses in each period reflects the Company’s overall assessment of the allowance for loan losses, taking into consideration factors such as loan mix, levels of non-performing and classified loans, and loan net charge-offs. The Company recorded loan net recoveries of $0.7 million (0.14% annualized of average loans) and loan net charge-offs of $1.9 million (0.46% annualized of average loans) in the fourth quarters of 2017 and 2016, respectively. For all of 2017 the Company recorded loan net recoveries of $1.2 million (0.06% annualized of average loans) as compared to loan net charge-offs of $1.0 million (0.06% of average loans) in 2016. This $2.2 million improvement primarily relates to mortgage loans with $0.6 million of net recoveries in 2017 as compared to $1.6 million in net charge-offs in 2016, reflecting lower levels of defaults, improved collateral values and efforts to collect on previously charged-off loans. At Dec. 31, 2017, the allowance for loan losses totaled $22.6 million, or 1.12% of portfolio loans, compared to $20.2 million, or 1.26% of portfolio loans, at Dec. 31, 2016.\nBalance Sheet, Liquidity and Capital\nTotal assets were $2.79 billion at Dec. 31, 2017, an increase of $240.4 million from Dec. 31, 2016. Loans, excluding loans held for sale, were $2.02 billion at Dec. 31, 2017, compared to $1.61 billion at Dec. 31, 2016, an increase of 25.5%.\nDeposits totaled $2.40 billion at Dec. 31, 2017, an increase of $174.8 million from Dec. 31, 2016. All categories of deposits increased during 2017 except time deposits. During 2017, time deposits declined by $79.0 million due primarily to the maturity of certificates of deposit with a municipal customer.\nCash and cash equivalents totaled $54.7 million at Dec. 31, 2017, versus $83.2 million at Dec. 31, 2016. Securities available for sale totaled $522.9 million at Dec. 31, 2017, versus $610.6 million at Dec. 31, 2016. The decline in cash and cash equivalents and securities available for sale during 2017 was due primarily to the funding of net loan growth.\nTotal shareholders’ equity was $264.9 million at Dec. 31, 2017, or 9.50% of total assets. Tangible common equity totaled $263.3 million at Dec. 31, 2017, or $12.34 per share. On Jan. 22, 2018, the Company’s Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend on its common stock of 15 cents per share. This dividend is payable on Feb. 15, 2018 to shareholders of record on Feb. 7, 2018.\nThe capital ratios for the Company’s wholly-owned subsidiary, Independent Bank, remain significantly above the minimum capital ratios required for the Bank to be considered “well capitalized” for regulatory purposes as follows:\nRegulatory Capital Ratios 12/31/2017 12/31/2016 Well\nCapitalized\nMinimum\nTier 1 capital to average total assets\n9.78\n%\n9.90\n%\n5.00\n% Tier 1 common equity to risk-weighted assets 12.95 % 13.87 % 6.50 % Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets 12.95 % 13.87 % 8.00 % Total capital to risk-weighted assets 14.10 % 15.02 % 10.00 % Share Repurchase Plan\nOn Jan. 22, 2018, the Board of Directors of the Company authorized a share repurchase plan. Under the terms of the share repurchase plan, the Company is authorized to buy back up to 5% of its outstanding common stock. The repurchase plan is authorized to last through Dec. 31, 2018.\nThe Company did not repurchase any shares under its 2017 share repurchase plan (which expired on Dec. 31, 2017).\nThe Company intends to accomplish the 2018 repurchases through open market transactions, though the Company could effect repurchases through other means, such as privately negotiated transactions. The timing and amount of any share repurchases will depend on a variety of factors, including, among others, securities law restrictions, the trading price of the Company's common stock, other regulatory requirements, potential alternative uses for capital, and the Company's financial performance. The repurchase program does not obligate the Company to acquire any particular amount of common stock, and it may be modified or suspended at any time at the Company's discretion. The Company expects to fund any repurchases from cash on hand.\nEarnings Conference Call\nBrad Kessel, President and CEO, and Rob Shuster, CFO, will review the quarterly results in a conference call for investors and analysts beginning at 11:00 am ET on Tuesday, Jan. 30, 2018.\nTo participate in the live conference call, dial 1-866-200-8394.
