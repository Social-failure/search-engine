Colleagues, newsmakers, and peers all appreciate the depth and context John Dickerson brings to every discussion of the day’s events—together with his co-hosts he will project our best values on every broadcast.” CBS News anchor John Dickerson has been named co-host of @CBSThisMorning , joining Gayle King and Norah O'Donnell #JohnJoinsThisMorning https://t.co/qLL0yqXeLT pic.twitter.com/tref3BTCHA \n— CBS News (@CBSNews) January 9, 2018 \nIn late November, The Washington Post published a report in which eight women accused Rose of sexual harassment, including groping, nudity, and vulgar phone calls. \nShortly after the report, Rose apologized for his behavior in a statement. \n“It is essential that these women know I hear them and that I deeply apologize for my inappropriate behavior,” he stated. “I am greatly embarrassed. I have behaved insensitively at times, and I accept responsibility for that, though I do not believe that all of these allegations are accurate. I always felt that I was pursuing shared feelings, even though I now realize I was mistaken.” My statement in full. pic.twitter.com/3kvFrqF2dT \n— Charlie Rose (@charlierose) November 20, 2017 \nCharlie Rose was also fired from his eponymous PBS show, and was replaced by Christiane Amanpour in early December.
