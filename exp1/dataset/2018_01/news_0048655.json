The joint Olympic team is \"a good thing,\" Carter said, \"but it's separate.\"\n\"We need to stay on the track to protect ourselves,\" said Carter, now the director of the Belfer Center for Science and International Affairs at Harvard University.\nInternational tensions escalated last year after North Korea leader Kim Jong Un stepped up his nuclear-armed missile program.\nThe U.S. on Wednesday slapped sanctions on entities it accuses of helping North Korea's weapons programs in an effort to further isolate the regime.\n\"North Korea needs to be constantly reminded that if they start a war on the Korean Peninsula ... [that] we will win,\" Carter told CNBC.\nWhile serving as an assistant secretary of defense in 1994, Carter was involved in the military planning to counter North Korea's nuclear weapons program.\nMorning Squawk: CNBC's before the bell news roundup Sign up to get Morning Squawk each weekday\nJob Industry Advertising/Marketing Automotive Communications/PR Construction/Manufacturing Education Finance/Banking/Insurance Legal Media/Entertainment Medical/Health Care Mining/Oil/Gas/Utilities Gov't/Non-Profit Real Estate Retail Technology/IT Transportation/Shipping Travel/Hospitality Other Get this delivered to your inbox, and more info about about our products and service.
