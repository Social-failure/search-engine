Harper hit five of Auburn’s 14 3-pointers.\nThe game was tight in the first half. Anfernee McLemore hit a 3-pointer that gave Auburn an early 10-9 lead. Auburn would lead the rest of the way and took a 41-36 edge into halftime behind 13 points from Murray.\nBarnett had 14 points in the first half.\nRobertson knocked down a 3-pointer to cap an 8-0 run for Missouri early in the second half. Auburn always had the answer, though, and moved into first place in the SEC with Florida’s loss to South Carolina.\nJordan Geist finished with 12 points for Missouri, and Kevin Puryear came off the bench to add 10 points.\nAuburn ran off 14 consecutive wins before falling at Alabama last week. Auburn has now bounced back from that loss with two straight SEC wins, and it returns home to host LSU on Saturday.\nMissouri has lost three of four and is facing a stretch of two straight SEC road games, beginning Saturday at Mississippi State.\n--Field Level Media\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-01-25T12:41:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-25T13:09:21.006+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
