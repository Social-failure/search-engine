But Kerber and Zverev were too strong for their rivals in the deciding mixed doubles rubber, winning 4-2 4-3. \nKerber started her singles match slowly, conceded an early break but fought back to claim three games in a row. She saved a set point at 5-6 and then forced a tiebreak which she won with a crisp backhand winner. \nThe former world number one raced to a 3-1 lead in the second set as Mertens struggled to cut out the errors. Despite saving a match point, Mertens could not match her rival in the tiebreak as Kerber prevailed in two hours. \n”It gives me a lot of confidence to start the year like this,“ said the world number 21. ”I think I need a few more matches to really get into my rhythm. However, for a start it was a good job. \n“My goal is to play the three matches, hopefully four, and to find a good transition from all the practice to the match court ahead of the first grand slam of the year.” Reporting by Shrivathsa Sridhar  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-01T17:10:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-01T17:22:29.025+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
