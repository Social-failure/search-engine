A turnaround is a scheduled event where an industrial plant is shut down to be revamped.\nBrokerage SICO Bahrain had projected a net profit of 5.34 billion riyals and NCB Capital had a forecast of 5.41 billion riyals for net profit in the fourth quarter.\nBenyan said at this point the company does not have any plans to raise debt, but will look at such options in the future if needed.
