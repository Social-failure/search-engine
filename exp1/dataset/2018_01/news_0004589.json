The test is interactive and follows the same subjective principles applied in an eye care professional's office where patients are asked to respond to a series of questions based on images presented to them. The software uses a series of vision tests, algorithms and patient medical history to provide ophthalmologists with a clinical decision support tool that enables them to diagnose patients with nearsightedness, farsightedness, astigmatism, emmetropia and to prescribe glasses or contacts when appropriate. With a mission to help the world see and feel better, the Opternative eye test will make vision screening and prescription services accessible and affordable to everyone.\nMedia Contact:\nPete Horkan, External Affairs\nEmail: Pete@Opternative.com\nPhone: 773.459.8859\nRelated Images\nimage1.jpg\nBrent Rasmussen\nimage2.png\nOpternative Logo\nView original content with multimedia: http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/opternative-names-former-careerbuilder-president-as-ceo-300577072.html\nSOURCE Opternative, Inc.", "external_links": ["http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/opternative-names-former-careerbuilder-president-as-ceo-300577072.html"], "published": "2018-01-03T21:40:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-03T22:46:21.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
