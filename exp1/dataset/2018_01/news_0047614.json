That was the goal before the match today. Not under the circumstances I was hoping to (reach the final)... \n“He struggled clearly with his movement. I was able to take advantage of that. I wish him a good recovery.” \nIt was an anti-climactic end for Chung, who played superbly to beat fourth seed Alexander Zverev in five sets in round three and even better in a straight sets win over six-times champion Novak Djokovic in the round of 16. \nThe 21-year-old was joined by his agent Stuart Duguid in the post-match news conference who explained what had happened. \n“It’s worse than regular blisters. Over the last few days, it was blister under blister under blister,” he said. RED RAW Tennis - Australian Open - Semifinals - Rod Laver Arena, Melbourne, Australia, January 26, 2018.

They tried injections to see if it numbed the pain. It didn’t work.” \n“I really hurt. I can’t walk no more,” Chung added. \nFederer admitted after his quarter-final victory over Tomas Berdych that he knew little about Chung’s counter-punching game, having never faced him before. \nHe had obviously done some homework though as he swarmed all over the world number 58 from the first game, feasting on Chung’s powder puff serve to break immediately after choosing to receive first having won the coin toss.
