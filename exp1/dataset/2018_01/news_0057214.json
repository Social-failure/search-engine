Sparton expects that both Sparton and Ultra will have certified compliance with the second requests on or before February 8, 2018. The DOJ’s decision on the pending merger might not be received by Sparton and Ultra by March 31, 2018. The merger agreement provides Ultra with the right to further extend the outside date for completing the pending merger until July 31, 2018 if certain regulatory approvals, including clearance under HSR, remain pending as of March 31, 2018.\nSparton and Ultra have been cooperating fully with the DOJ as it conducts its review and are continuing to work with the DOJ to obtain clearance of the pending merger.\nAbout Sparton Corporation\nSparton Corporation (NYSE:SPA), now in its 118th year, is a provider of complex and sophisticated electromechanical devices with capabilities that include concept development, industrial design, design and manufacturing engineering, production, distribution, field service, and refurbishment.
