(NYSE: SXC) today reported fourth quarter and full-year 2017 results, reflecting improved operating performance and tax benefits associated with recently passed legislation.\n\"A solid fourth quarter contributed to SunCoke's success in delivering full-year Adjusted EBITDA at the top end of our guidance range, and again illustrated the strength of our coke and logistics businesses,\" said Mike Rippey, President and Chief Executive Officer of SunCoke Energy, Inc. \"In 2017, our teams delivered strong operating results, which included our successful efforts to diversify CMT's customer and product base, optimized our capital structure and remained disciplined in deploying SunCoke capital.\"\nLooking forward, the Company expects 2018 consolidated Adjusted EBITDA to be between $240 million and $255 million, reflecting improvement at Indiana Harbor and higher logistics volumes.\nRippey continued, \"As we move into 2018, we will remain focused on operations excellence, including the rebuild initiative at our Indiana Harbor facility and our continued efforts to secure new business at CMT. In doing so, I am confident that we can again execute against our objectives and deliver value to SunCoke shareholders.\"\nCONSOLIDATED RESULTS\nThree Months Ended\nDecember 31,\nYears Ended\nDecember 31,\n(Dollars in millions)\n2017\n2016\nIncrease/\n(Decrease)\n2017\n2016\nIncrease\nTotal revenues\n$\n359.6\n$\n325.6\n$\n34.0\n$\n1,331.5\n$\n1,223.3\n$\n108.2\nNet income attributable to SXC\n$\n134.0\n$\n17.0\n$\n117.0\n$\n122.4\n$\n14.4\n$\n108.0\nAdjusted EBITDA (1)\n$\n69.5\n$\n77.3\n$\n(7.8)\n$\n234.7\n$\n217.0\n$\n17.7\n(1)\nSee definition of Adjusted EBITDA and reconciliation elsewhere in this release.\nTotal revenues from operations increased $34.0 million and $108.2 million for the fourth quarter and full-year 2017, respectively, compared with the same prior year periods, primarily reflecting the pass-through of higher coal prices in our Domestic Coke segment.\nAdjusted EBITDA during the fourth quarter of 2017 decreased $7.8 million to $69.5 million compared to the same prior year periods, primarily driven by the timing of revenue recognized on our Logistics take-or-pay contracts discussed in the segment results below. Excluding this timing impact, fourth quarter 2017 results improved $7.3 million as compared to the prior year period.\nFull-year Adjusted EBITDA increased $17.7 million to $234.7 million, primarily reflecting higher volumes in our Logistics segment and a $4.5 million benefit of the full-year absence of our legacy coal mining business, which was disposed of in April 2016. Lower Adjusted EBITDA in our Domestic Coke segment was offset by record production performance in our Brazil Coke segment and lower employee-related corporate costs.\nFourth quarter and full-year 2017 net income attributable to SXC was $134.0 million, or $2.05 per share, and $122.4 million, or $1.88 per share, reflecting operating results discussed above as well as income tax benefits associated with the recently passed tax legislation, which lowered corporate tax rates. These full-year period benefits were partially offset by the net impact of current year losses on extinguishment of debt and the absence of prior year gains on extinguishment of debt.\nSEGMENT RESULTS\nDomestic Coke\nDomestic Coke consists of cokemaking facilities and heat recovery operations at our Jewell, Indiana Harbor, Haverhill, Granite City and Middletown plants.\nThree Months Ended\nDecember 31,\nYears Ended\nDecember 31,\n(Dollars in millions, except per ton amounts)\n2017\n2016\nIncrease\n2017\n2016\nIncrease/\n(Decrease)\nSales and other operating revenues\n$\n310.1\n$\n261.4\n$\n48.7\n$\n1,195.0\n$\n1,097.6\n$\n97.4\nAdjusted EBITDA (1)\n$\n39.6\n$\n36.5\n$\n3.1\n$\n188.9\n$\n193.9\n$\n(5.0)\nSales Volume (in thousands of tons)\n977\n964\n13\n3,851\n3,956\n(105)\nAdjusted EBITDA per ton (2)\n$\n40.53\n$\n37.86\n$\n2.67\n$\n49.05\n$\n49.01\n$\n0.04\n(1)\nSee definitions of Adjusted EBITDA and reconciliation elsewhere in this release.\n(2)\nReflects Domestic Coke Adjusted EBITDA divided by Domestic Coke sales volumes.\nRevenues increased $48.7 million and $97.4 million, for the fourth quarter and full-year 2017, respectively, compared with the same prior year periods, primarily as a result of the pass-through of higher coal prices. The increase in revenues for full-year 2017 were partially offset by a decrease in sales volumes of 105 thousand tons compared to 2016, driven by more ovens out of service at Indiana Harbor in connection with the ongoing oven rebuild initiative. Adjusted EBITDA increased $3.1 million to $39.6 million for the fourth quarter 2017 driven by higher energy sales at our Haverhill facility, which were negatively impacted in the prior year by a turbine failure. Favorable volumes and favorable coal-to-coke yields in 2017 were offset by higher operating and maintenance costs, partly attributable to a higher number of Indiana Harbor oven rebuilds as compared to the prior year period. Adjusted EBITDA decreased $5.0 million to $188.9 million for the full-year 2017 driven by higher operating and maintenance costs and lower sales volumes related to our Indiana Harbor oven rebuilds, partially offset by the impacts of favorable coal-to-coke yields and higher energy sales at our Haverhill facility discussed above.\nLogistics\nLogistics consists of the handling and mixing services of coal and other aggregates operated by SXCP at our Convent Marine Terminal (\"CMT\"), Lake Terminal and Kanawha River Terminals (\"KRT\").

CMT achieved record volumes in 2017, including higher throughput on take-or-pay contracts, which resulted in higher revenues throughout 2017 and lowered the deferred revenue recognized in the fourth quarter 2017 for take-or-pay volume shortfalls as compared to same prior year period.\nBrazil Coke\nBrazil Coke consists of a cokemaking facility in Vit√≥ria, Brazil, which we operate for an affiliate of ArcelorMittal.\nAdjusted EBITDA decreased $3.6 million to $4.7 million in fourth quarter of 2017 related to the timing of the recognition of licensing fees. In 2016, the full-year benefit of $5.1 million for incremental technology and licensing fees related to the addition of certain patents to our existing intellectual property licensing agreement was recognized during the fourth quarter, at the time of the agreement, but was recognized ratably each quarter throughout 2017. Adjusted EBITDA increased $2.0 million to $18.2 million for the full-year 2017 compared to 2016 due to higher volumes and favorable translation adjustments. Higher volumes resulted in higher production bonuses received from our customer in the current year for meeting certain volume targets beyond that of the prior year.\nCorporate and Other\nCorporate and other expenses, which includes activity from our legacy coal mining business, were $9.9 million and $43.2 million in the fourth quarter and full-year of 2017, respectively, compared with the same prior year periods. The fourth quarter 2017 resulted in an improvement of $2.9 million versus fourth quarter 2016 primarily due to lower employee-related and other costs. The full-year 2017 experienced an improvement of $13.8 million versus the full-year 2016, driven by a $4.5 million period-over-period benefit associated with the absence of our legacy coal mining business, which was disposed of in April 2016. The current full-year period also benefited from $4.6 million of lower employee-related and other costs and $2.2 million of favorable period-over-period, mark-to-market adjustments in deferred compensation driven by changes in the Company's share price and the Partnership's unit price. The remaining improvement was driven by lower costs incurred to resolve certain legal matters as compared to the prior year period.\n2018 OUTLOOK\nOur 2018 guidance is as follows:\nDomestic coke production is expected to be approximately 3.9 million tons Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA is expected to be between $240 million to $255 million Adjusted EBITDA attributable to SXC is expected to be between $160 million and $171 million, reflecting the impact of public ownership in SXCP Capital expenditures are projected to be approximately $95 million, including $25 million to $30 million related to our Indiana Harbor oven rebuild project and approximately $35 million related to our Granite City gas sharing project Cash generated by operations is estimated to be between $150 million and $165 million Cash taxes are projected to be between $7 million and $14 million\nRELATED COMMUNICATIONS\nToday, we will host an investor conference call at 11:00 a.m. Eastern Time (10:00 a.m. Central Time).

EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA do not represent and should not be considered alternatives to net income or operating income under GAAP and may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures in other businesses. Management believes Adjusted EBITDA is an important measure of the operating performance and liquidity of the Company's net assets and its ability to incur and service debt, fund capital expenditures and make distributions. Adjusted EBITDA provides useful information to investors because it highlights trends in our business that may not otherwise be apparent when relying solely on GAAP measures and because it eliminates items that have less bearing on our operating performance and liquidity. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are not measures calculated in accordance with GAAP, and they should not be considered a substitute for net income, operating cash flow or any other measure of financial performance presented in accordance with GAAP. Adjusted EBITDA attributable to SXC/SXCP represents consolidated Adjusted EBITDA less Adjusted EBITDA attributable to noncontrolling interests.\nFORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS\nSome of the statements included in this press release constitute \"forward-looking statements\" (as defined in Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended).

The Partnership amended its contingent consideration terms with The Cline Group during the first quarter of 2016. This amendment and subsequent fair value adjustments to the contingent consideration liability, resulted in gains of $1.8 million and $10.1 million recorded during the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2016, respectively, which were excluded from Adjusted EBITDA.\n(2)\nIn 2014, we finalized the required permitting and engineering plan for a potential new cokemaking facility to be constructed in Kentucky. However, in June 2017, due to our focus on renewing our existing customer contracts and the lack of any long-term customer commitment for a majority of the facility's capacity, we decided to terminate the project. As a result, during 2017, the Company wrote-off previously capitalized engineering and land deposit costs of $5.3 million. During 2016, the Company wrote-off expiring land deposits related to the project of $1.9 million.\n(3)\nIn association with the acquisition of CMT, we assumed certain performance obligations under existing contracts and recorded liabilities related to such obligations. In 2016, the final acquired contractual performance obligations expired without the customers requiring performance. Therefore, the Partnership reversed the liabilities as we no longer have any obligations under the contracts.\n(4)\nPrior to the divestiture of our coal mining business, the Company incurred coal rationalization costs including employee severance, contract termination costs and other costs to idle mines incurred during the execution of our coal rationalization plan.\n(5)\nIn accordance with the SEC's May 2016 update of its guidance on the appropriate use of non-GAAP financial measures, Adjusted EBITDA does not include Logistics deferred revenue until it is recognized as GAAP revenue.\n(6)\nReflects noncontrolling interest in Indiana Harbor and the portion of the Partnership owned by public unitholders.\nSunCoke Energy, Inc.\nReconciliation of Non-GAAP Information\nEstimated 2017 Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities to Estimated Net Income and Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA\n2018\nLow\nHigh\nNet Cash Provided by Operating activities\n$\n150\n$\n165\nSubtract:\nDepreciation and amortization expense\n137\n129\nChanges in working capital and other\n(22)\n(14)\nNet Income\n$\n35\n$\n50\nAdd:\nDepreciation and amortization expense\n137\n129\nInterest expense, net\n63\n63\nIncome tax expense\n5\n13\nAdjusted EBITDA\n$\n240\n$\n255\nSubtract: Adjusted EBITDA attributable to noncontrolling interest (1)\n80\n84\nAdjusted EBITDA attributable to SXC\n$\n160\n$\n171\n(1)\nReflects non-controlling interest in Indiana Harbor and the portion of the Partnership owned by public unitholders.\nView original content with multimedia: http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/suncoke-energy-inc-announces-full-year-2017-results-at-top-end-of-guidance-range-and-provides-guidance-for-further-improvement-in-2018-300590816.html\nSOURCE SunCoke Energy, Inc.", "external_links": ["http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/suncoke-energy-inc-announces-full-year-2017-results-at-top-end-of-guidance-range-and-provides-guidance-for-further-improvement-in-2018-300590816.html", "http://www.suncoke.com/"], "published": "2018-01-31T14:45:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-31T17:49:12.004+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
