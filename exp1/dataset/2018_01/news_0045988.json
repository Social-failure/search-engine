(NYSE: HTH) (“Hilltop”) today announced financial results for the fourth quarter and full year of 2017. Hilltop produced income of $13.4 million, or $0.14 per diluted share, for the fourth quarter of 2017, compared to $35.3 million, or $0.36 per diluted share, for the fourth quarter of 2016. Income to common stockholders for the full year 2017 was $132.5 million, or $1.36 per diluted share, compared to $145.9 million, or $1.48 per diluted share, for the full year 2016.\nHilltop’s results during the fourth quarter and full year of 2017 include the estimated impact of a non-recurring, non-cash charge 1 of $28.4 million primarily attributable to the revaluation of deferred tax assets as a result of the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (“Tax Legislation”). Our results during the full year of 2017 were also impacted by losses from Hurricanes Harvey and Irma of $8.2 million, as well as increases to other noninterest income of $15.0 million from coverage provided by an insurance policy for forgery of a document delivered in connection with a single, large loan charged off by the Bank in 2016 and $11.6 million from the resolution of the appraisal proceedings from the SWS merger, both of which occurred during the second quarter of 2017. The results for the fourth quarter and full year of 2016 included a specific legal reserve of $16.0 million related to one matter involving HilltopSecurities. The results for the full year of 2016 also included a $24.5 million charge-off of the previously discussed loan by the Bank.\nHilltop also announced that its Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.07 per common share, a 16.7% increase from prior quarter, payable on February 28, 2018, to all common stockholders of record as of the close of business on February 15, 2018. Furthermore, the Hilltop Board of Directors authorized a new stock repurchase program through January 2019, under which Hilltop may repurchase, in the aggregate, up to $50.0 million of its outstanding common stock.\nJeremy Ford, Co-CEO of Hilltop, said, “Hilltop’s fourth quarter earnings reflect solid performance across our businesses, particularly from our insurance segment. We remain focused on profitable growth, efficiency improvements and sound capital management. Importantly, in 2017 Hilltop returned $50.5 million of capital to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases.”\nAlan White, Co-CEO of Hilltop, added, “Hilltop’s operating companies continued to thrive from a shared commitment to our clients and communities. During this quarter, PlainsCapital Bank was able to grow core deposits and commercial loans, PrimeLending was able to increase mortgage market share, and HilltopSecurities was able to build on its earnings and margin momentum.”\nFourth Quarter 2017 Highlights for Hilltop:\nHilltop’s annualized return on average assets 1 and return on average equity 1 for the fourth quarter of 2017 were 0.41% and 2.78%, respectively, compared to 1.13% and 7.56%, respectively, for the fourth quarter of 2016; Hilltop’s total assets were $13.4 billion at December 31, 2017, compared to $13.5 billion at September 30, 2017; Hilltop’s common equity increased by $5.9 million from September 30, 2017 to $1.9 billion at December 31, 2017; Non-covered loans 2 held for investment, net of allowance for loan losses, increased by 2.0% to $6.2 billion and covered loans 2 , net of allowance for loan losses, decreased by 4.7% to $179.4 million at December 31, 2017 compared to September 30, 2017; Non-covered non-performing loans increased to $40.5 million, or 0.51% of total non-covered loans, at December 31, 2017, compared to $40.1 million, or 0.50% of total non-covered loans, at September 30, 2017; Energy classified and criticized loans were $28.6 million at December 31, 2017, increasing from $24.4 million at September 30, 2017; Loans held for sale decreased by 11.6% from September 30, 2017 to $1.7 billion at December 31, 2017; Total deposits were $8.0 billion at December 31, 2017, compared to $7.7 billion at September 30, 2017; Hilltop maintained strong capital levels with a Tier 1 Leverage Ratio 3 of 12.94% and a Common Equity Tier 1 Capital Ratio of 17.69% at December 31, 2017; Hilltop’s net interest margin 4 of 3.63% for the fourth quarter of 2017, compared to 3.50% in the third quarter of 2017; The provision for loan losses was $5.5 million during the fourth quarter of 2017, compared to $1.3 million in the third quarter of 2017; For the fourth quarter of 2017, noninterest income was $290.5 million, compared to $309.1 million in the fourth quarter of 2016, a 6.0% decrease; and For the fourth quarter of 2017, noninterest expense was $328.7 million, compared to $355.8 million in the fourth quarter of 2016, a 7.6% decrease.\n1 The enactment of Tax Legislation during the noted periods resulted in an estimated non-cash, non-recurring charge of $28.4 million primarily attributable to the revaluation of deferred tax assets. Certain Tax Legislation amounts are considered reasonable estimates as of December 31, 2017 and could be adjusted during the measurement period, which will end in December 2018, as a result of further refinement of our calculations, changes in interpretations and assumptions made, guidance that may be issued and actions we may take as a result of Tax Legislation. 2 “Covered loans” refer to loans acquired in the FNB Transaction that are subject to loss-share agreements with the FDIC, while all other loans are referred to as “non-covered loans.” 3 Based on the end of period Tier 1 capital divided by total average assets during 2017, excluding goodwill and intangible assets. 4 Net interest margin is defined as net interest income divided by average interest-earning assets.

respectively, primarily attributable to the revaluation of deferred tax assets as a result of the enactment of the Tax Legislation. Certain Tax Legislation amounts are considered reasonable estimates as of December 31, 2017 and could be adjusted during the measurement period, which will end in December 2018, as a result of further refinement of our calculations, changes in interpretations and assumptions made, guidance that may be issued and actions we may take as a result of Tax Legislation. (2) Net interest margin is defined as net interest income divided by average interest-earning assets. (3) Net interest margin (taxable equivalent), a non-GAAP measure, is defined as taxable equivalent net interest income divided by average interest-earning assets. Taxable equivalent adjustments are based on a 35% federal income tax rate. The interest income earned on certain earning assets is completely or partially exempt from federal income tax. As such, these tax-exempt instruments typically yield lower returns than taxable investments. To provide more meaningful comparisons of net interest margins for all earning assets, we use net interest income on a taxable-equivalent basis in calculating net interest margin by increasing the interest income earned on tax-exempt assets to make it fully equivalent to interest income earned on taxable investments. For the periods presented, the taxable equivalent adjustments to interest income for Hilltop Consolidated were $0.6 million, $0.6 million, $0.6 million, $2.2 million, and $2.4 million, respectively, and for the Banking Segment were $0.4 million, $0.4 million, $0.4 million, $1.6 million, and $1.5 million, respectively. (4) Dividend payout ratio is defined as cash dividends declared per common share divided by basic earnings per common share. (5) Net revenue is defined as the sum of total broker-dealer net interest income plus total broker-dealer noninterest income (6) Reported on a consolidated basis and therefore does not include mortgage servicing rights assets related to loans serviced for the banking segment, which are eliminated in consolidation.
