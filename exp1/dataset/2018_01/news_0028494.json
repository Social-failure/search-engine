A senior source said Abdelrahman had shed no new light on the case last week and added that this was “disappointing”.\nToope said both Abdelrahman and the university had repeatedly offered to help with the case. “In light of her willingness to assist, the public campaign of denigration, fanned by political expediency, is shameful,” he said.\nRegeni had been looking into Egypt’s independent labor unions for his thesis and attracted the suspicion of the Cairo government before his disappearance, sources told Reuters in 2016.\nSecurity and intelligence sources told Reuters that Regeni was arrested in Cairo on Jan. 25, 2016, and taken into custody. His disfigured body was found in a ditch more than a week later. Egyptian officials have denied any involvement in his killing.\nItalian media have Quote: d anonymous sources as saying the magistrates were interested in whether Abdelrahman played a role in commissioning Regeni to research the delicate topic and whether she had warned him of the danger.\nA senior Italian legal source told Reuters the tutor had told magistrates Regeni had picked his own research subject.\nToope said Regeni was “an experienced researcher” who knew Egypt and spoke fluent Arabic.\n“It is not uncommon for academic research in the humanities and social sciences to impinge on politically sensitive issues,” he said. “He was using standard academic methods to study trade unions in Egypt.”\nToope said Cambridge would continue to assist investigators, saying the university wanted to see justice for Regeni and also the reputation of its scholars safeguarded.\n“This brutal killing calls for justice. But justice will not be served by undermining the very thing that drove Giulio in his brief but inspiring academic career, the search for truth.”\nReporting by Crispian Balmer; Editing by Peter Graff\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-01-18T00:32:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-18T16:21:18.009+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
