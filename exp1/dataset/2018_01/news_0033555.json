The company is also calling for co-operation across industries regarding the issue.\n\"We want to adopt a circular model where 100 percent of our plastic bottles will become bottles again. This will enable plastic to evolve from potential waste to become a valuable resource,\" Evian global brand director Patricia Oliva told Reuters.\nIn the process Evian currently uses to recycle plastic, 'PET' cannot be recycled more than three times because the quality suffers. With Loop's technology, Evian will be able to recycle the plastic again and again, retaining the same quality.\nDanone is the world's third-largest bottled water company, and Evian is its marquee label in a portfolio that also has the Badoit and Volvic brands.\nIn September, Evian inaugurated its modernized, carbon-neutral bottling plant in the spa town of Evian-Les-Bains close to Lake Geneva, and Danone aims to make Evian its first, major carbon-neutral mineral water brand by 2020.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-18T14:32:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-18T19:40:39.015+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
