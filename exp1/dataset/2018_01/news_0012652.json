We're full,\" Ron Cridlebaugh, the Port of Douglas County economic development manager, told CNBC's Michelle Caruso-Cabrera on Thursday. \nElectricity in Washington state is considerably cheaper than in most places in the U.S. The average electricity price per kilowatt in the state is 4 cents. By comparison, the national average is 7 cents. \nCryptocurrencies like bitcoin and ripple have skyrocketed in value recently. Last year, both digital currencies surged 1,500 percent and 35,000 percent, respectively. \nPeople have been trying to get in on the action by purchasing these digital assets or by \"mining,\" or creating them. But the mining process requires lots of electrical power as computers process gargantuan amounts of data to produce digital currencies. \nCridlebaugh said the county is building out 100 megawatts (100,000 kilowatts) of infrastructure just in data centers to keep up with demand. \"It's going to take some time to catch up because growth has been so quick.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-11T22:56:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-11T23:17:44.013+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
