REUTERS/Samrang Pring/Files Kem Sokha’s daughter Kem Monovithya said that it’s important not to get distracted from the CNRP.\n“I continue to do what I have been doing under CNRP framework, in consultation with the imprisoned leader Kem Sokha, to advocate for free and fair elections in Cambodia,” Kem Monovithya said.\nSam Rainsy, who has lived in France since 2015 to avoid a series of convictions, didn’t respond to Reuters request for comment.\nThe CNRP was dissolved after the arrest of Kem Sokha, who was accused of plotting to take power with American help - charges he says were politically motivated because the threat the party posed to Hun Sen at this year’s election.\nThe dissolution of the party and arrest of Kem Sokha have been condemned by Western aid donors who have said the election cannot now be credible. Hun Sen, 65, is expected to win easily.\nThe CNRP was set up in 2012 to unify Sam Rainsy’s and Kem Sokha’s separate parties. Its success in a 2013 general election and local elections last year had shown what a powerful electoral force it had become.\nReporting by Prak Chan Thul; Editing by Michael Perry\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-20T07:46:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-20T08:01:37.002+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
