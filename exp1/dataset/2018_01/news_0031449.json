The League has called for the tax rate to be set at 15 percent, while Berlusconi has said it should be somewhere between 20-25 percent.\nThe current top tax rate stands at 43 percent.\nFILE PHOTO: Italy's former Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi gestures during the taping of the television talk show \"Porta a Porta\" (Door to Door) in Rome, Italy January 11, 2018. REUTERS/Remo Casilli/File Photo Center-right leaders have given little indication of how they will make up the shortfall in revenues, suggesting only that they will step up the fight against tax evasion and predicting that the new tax regime would stimulate the economy.\nThe final manifesto is unlikely to commit to a specific tax rate, officials said.\nIndeed, much of the program is expected to be made up of general pledges, rather than nitty-gritty policy proposals, enabling them to paper over differences between their individual policy platforms, which will be published separately.\nOther joint election promises are expected to include a crackdown on illegal immigration and a change to national law which would give the Italian constitution precedence over any legislation approved by the European Parliament - a move that could put Italy on a collision course with Brussels.\nOne thing the center-right bloc has yet to agree on is who will be the prime minister should they sweep the center-left government from power.\nBerlusconi said earlier on Thursday that he was ready to lead Italy again if the European Court of Human Rights scrapped a ban on him holding public office. However, such a ruling is unlikely before the March election.\nReporting by Crispian Balmer; editing by Grant McCool\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-01-19T07:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-19T12:30:38.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
