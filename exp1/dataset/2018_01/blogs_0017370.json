On Monday, China issued stricter rules on building new steel production capacity to replace obsolete facilities, which may cut supply even further. \nCoal prices have also been supported by gas shortages in China this winter. The market is also pricing in supply shortages for the future due to the government's pollution clean-up, Gao added.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-09T07:37:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-09T09:47:53.960+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
