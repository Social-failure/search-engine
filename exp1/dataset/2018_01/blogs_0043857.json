Revenue: $21.92 billion vs. $21.82 billion expected by a Thomson Reuters. \nA year earlier, Comcast reported adjusted earnings of 45 cents per share on revenue of $21.03 billion. \nShares were flat in Wednesday's premarket after the announcement. \nThe financial results of the owner of CNBC parent NBCUniversal set the stage for rivals that are also exploring combinations of content and internet services.\nCable and internet business \nComcast's Xfinity is one of the biggest residential providers of video, internet and phone. Comcast now has 29.3 million customers.\nComcast added 350,000 high-speed internet customers during the quarter, slightly less than a year earlier, but still the largest source of sales growth for the company. But 33,000 video customers left during the quarter, a change Comcast attributed to more \"aggressive\" offers from traditional and emerging competitors.\nStill, it's better than analysts expected. Comcast was expected to lose 45,000 video subscribers and gain 312,000 high-speed internet customers, according to a FactSet consensus estimate. Comcast lost 13,000 voice customers during the quarter, narrower than the 23,000 customer loss forecast by FactSet.\nMedia business \nNBC's film division had its most profitable year ever in its 105-year history, the company said Wednesday. In addiiton, Universal Pictures hit $5 billion at the global box office over the holidays for the second time ever. But during the quarter, film revenue dropped by about 5 percent, despite hits like \"Fate of the Furious,\" \"Despicable Me 3\" and the latest installment of \"Pitch Perfect.\"\nTheme parks, broadcast and cable networks also saw revenue increases from a year earlier, thanks to new attractions at the parks and distribution and content licensing.\nThe company has a big quarter ahead in media, with the Super Bowl and Winter Olympics next month.\nComcast's earnings is closely watched in the media industry. The combination of content and the \"pipes\" to deliver it is something that other companies are exploring as well: Verizon has Yahoo and AOL, and now Time Warner and AT&T hope to seal a merger deal. Disney and Twenty-First Century Fox are also joining forces.\nDisclosure: Comcast is the owner of NBCUniversal, parent company of CNBC and CNBC.com.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-24T14:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-24T14:25:06.125+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
