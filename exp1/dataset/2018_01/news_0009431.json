The rulings “coincide with preparations by the Ras Lanuf company to resume operations in the second half of 2018”, a statement posted on a Facebook page used by the company said.\nOne of the cases had been brought by the Libyan Emirati Refining Company (LERCO), the owner and operator of the refinery, and was decided on Jan. 5, the NOC said. It said the ruling had awarded the NOC nearly $116 million plus interest.\nThe second case had been brought by TRASTA, owned by Emirati group Al Ghurair, and a ruling last November forced TRASTA to withdraw its case, the NOC said. LERCO is a joint venture between the NOC and TRASTA.\n“From now the NOC will be engaged in taking the necessary measures to implement the final arbitration ruling ... and restart the refinery as soon as possible,” the NOC statement Quote: d its Chairman Mustafa Sanalla as saying.\n“We ask TRASTA and LERCO to comply fully with their contractual obligations.”\nRelated Coverage Libyan oil firm hopes for Ras Lanuf restart in second half of 2018 after refinery ruling\nReporting by Ahamad Ghaddar, Aidan Lewis and Ayman al-Warfalli; Editing by Jane Merriman and Alison Williams\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-01-07T19:51:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-08T00:23:17.001+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
