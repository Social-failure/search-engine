REUTERS/Adriano Machado/File Photo “While you don’t want to blame individuals, in the end the CEO of the company has to take responsibility.”\nKhosrowshahi, however, said that Kalanick has been available as a board member to provide guidance.\nLast week, a consortium led by SoftBank Group Corp took a 17.5 percent stake in Uber, mostly by buying shares from early investors and employees at a discounted valuation of $48 billion for the company.\nKalanick sold nearly a third of his 10 percent stake in the ride-services company for about $1.4 billion, a person familiar with the matter told Reuters.\nReporting by Supantha Mukherjee and Arjun Panchadar in Bengaluru; Editing by Supriya Kurane\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-23T15:15:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-23T15:58:36.025+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
