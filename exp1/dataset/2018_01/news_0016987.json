On Thursday, Virgin America flights adopted Alaska Airlines' simpler call sign, \"Alaska,\" because the two airlines will operate under what's known as a \"single operating certificate.\"\n\"It's like changing your name if you get married,\" said Phil Derner, a former airline dispatcher and founder of NYCaviation.com, an aviation news and plane-spotting website.\nThe Federal Aviation Administration announced the name change last month.\n\"Redwood\" is just one of several colorful call signs used by airlines. British Airways is known as \"Speedbird,\" which refers to an early airline logo. Angolan cargo airline Gemini is known as \"Twins.\"\nAn air traffic controller would use the call sign and flight number to address the pilots — for example, \"Speedbird 1516.\"\nUS Airways used \"Cactus,\" a holdover from America West, an Arizona-based carrier it merged with in 2005. US Airways later merged with American Airlines , whose call sign is simply \"American.\" Delta is \"Delta,\" and United is \"United.\"\nAlaska is in the midst of marrying its fleets and crews with those of Virgin America, which began flying in August 2007. Passengers can still book flights on the Virgin America website and fly on its planes.\nGood night, Redwood.\nWATCH: Branson on Virgin America sale show chapters Branson on Virgin America sale: ‘I don’t normally take these things lying down’ 1:08 PM ET Wed, 18 Oct 2017 | 01:12", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-11T23:45:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-12T00:26:12.001+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
