He said Perez’ group had attacked first and that officials had acted in self-defense. \nMaduro’s socialist government has described Perez as a “fanatic, extremist terrorist” and had been carrying out a manhunt for him since last June. \nGovernment critics initially questioned whether Perez’ attacks were staged in cahoots with the government to justify a further crackdown on the opposition. \nBut his death prompted an outcry over what critics called an extrajudicial killing and turned him into a martyr for hard-line foes of Maduro. \n“Honor and glory to those brave citizens who gave their life for their ideals,” tweeted former Caracas mayor Antonio Ledezma, now in exile in Spain after himself being jailed on charges of leading a coup against Maduro.
