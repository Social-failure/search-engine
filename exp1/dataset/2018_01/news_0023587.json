We will continue to call attention to, and designate, entities and individuals complicit in such actions,” he said. \nChina and Russia have sharply criticized the Vancouver meeting, which was announced after North Korea tested its biggest ever intercontinental ballistic missile in late November, as an example of “Cold War” thinking. While both have signed up to U.N. sanctions, they have been accused of not doing enough to ensure proper implementation, something they deny. \nTillerson said all countries needed to work together to improve interdiction of ships attempting to skirt the sanctions and said there must be “new consequences” for North Korea “whenever new aggression occurs.” \nThe White House has welcomed news that China’s imports from North Korea plunged in December to their lowest in dollar terms since at least the start of 2014, but Trump accused Beijing last month of allowing oil into North Korea. \nWestern European security sources told Reuters last month Russian tankers had supplied fuel to North Korea on at least three occasions in recent months by transferring cargoes at sea.

REUTERS/Ben Nelms \nEarlier on Tuesday, Chinese state media said Chinese President Xi Jinping told U.S. President Donald Trump in a phone call that unity on the North Korean issue was extremely important and the hard-earned easing of tensions must continue. \nThe White House said Trump and Xi both expressed hope that the resumption of North-South dialogue might prompt a change in Pyongyang’s “destructive behavior,” but Trump also committed to sustain the maximum pressure campaign. \nNorth and South Korea held formal talks for the first time in two years this month and Pyongyang said it would send athletes to the Olympics. \nSouth Korean Foreign Minister Kang Kyung-wha said in Vancouver she hoped the dialogue would continue well beyond the Olympics, but stressed that existing sanctions must be applied more rigorously.

Security Council “paves the way for diplomatic engagement.” \nDiplomats say the absence of China, North Korea’s main ally and trading partner, will limit what can be achieved in Vancouver. \nChina’s main English-language newspaper, The China Daily, said the meeting was “poorly conceived” and would prove counter-productive. \n“At a moment when Pyongyang and Seoul are just beginning a rare detente and talking about further extending mutual goodwill, what good will rhetoric about further sanctions do?” it said.
