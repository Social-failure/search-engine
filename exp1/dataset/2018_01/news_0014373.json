It named City Developments ( CTDM.SI ) as its top pick in a research note on Monday. \nIf the forecasts stack up, the city state’s economy could get an extra fillip from the expected pick up in construction activity, though there was scant data on the specific impact on output. \nJefferies expects a rise of low-to-mid single digits in residential prices in 2018. \nReal estate services firm Colliers on Wednesday said average home prices may rise by 17 percent over 2018-2021, supported by higher economic growth, falling physical completions and ongoing collective sale deals.
