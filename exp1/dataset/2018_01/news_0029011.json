Those two rates were also unchanged. \nLast month, the bank raised its late liquidity window rate by a less-than-expected 50 basis points, easing some investor worry over its independence, in an attempt to battle volatile lira and inflation which peaked at 12.98 percent in November. \nPresident Tayyip Erdogan, who wants cheap credit to boost growth, has long been opposed to high interest rates and the central bank has resorted to unorthodox liquidity moves, heightening the perception it wants to avoid a sharp rate hike.
