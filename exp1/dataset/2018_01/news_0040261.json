The TSA said most of the requirements were already being voluntarily applied by airlines around the world. \nCarriers must submit advance air cargo data to U.S. authorities. The program uses U.S. Department of Homeland Security “threat information and other data to employ a risk-based approach to improve air cargo security through targeted vetting.” \n\nFILE PHOTO: Qatar Airways aircrafts are seen at Hamad International Airport in Doha, Qatar June 12, 2017. REUTERS/Naseem Zeitoon/File Photo A Royal Jordanian spokeswoman said the airline had “received this new amendment from TSA to be implemented on air cargo shipments, and we were given one month period to apply the new amendment.” \nEmirates, Qatar Airways, and Saudi Arabian Airlines did not immediately respond to requests for comment. \n\nFILE PHOTO: Emirates Airlines aircraft are seen at Dubai International Airport, United Arab Emirates May 10, 2016. REUTERS/Ashraf Mohammad/File Photo In September, TSA issued a new security directive requiring enhanced screening of cargo from Turkey after an incident in Australia. \nIn July, an Australian man sent his unsuspecting brother to Sydney airport to catch an Etihad Airways flight carrying a home-made bomb disguised as a meat mincer built at the direction of a senior Islamic State commander. \nRelated Coverage Egypt dismisses report U.S. has banned cargo transport from Cairo airport High-grade military explosives used to build the bomb were sent by air cargo from Turkey. \nIn October, new security measures including stricter passenger screening started taking effect on all U.S.-bound flights, including some short security interviews with passengers at check-in or the boarding gate. \nIn July, the United States lifted restrictions on carry-on electronic devices on planes coming from 10 airports in eight countries in the Middle East and North Africa. \nReporting by David Shepardson in Washington Additional reporting by Alexander Cornwell in Dubai; Editing by Andrew Hay and Susan Thomas\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-22T17:40:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-22T18:06:44.004+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
