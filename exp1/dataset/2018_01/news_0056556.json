Health and Human Services Secretary Tom Price stepped down in September following a scandal over private chartered flights that cost taxpayers more than $1 million during his eight months in the position. \nTrips taken by Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin , which totaled more than $800,000 over eight months, were paid for by tax dollars and came under scrutiny last fall. \nDonald Trump repeatedly criticized former President Barack Obama and his family for their travel expenses during his presidency. \nFormer first lady Michelle Obama’s travel costs totaled about $2.8 million for all eight years of her husband’s tenure, or about $350,000 per year, according to the Journal .
