It won’t come down drastically but the market will consolidate at these levels before the next move.” \nAnalysts expect the market to settle at 6,600 levels. \nCeylon Tobacco Company Plc ended 3.3 percent down, while Hatton National Bank Plc closed 0.8 percent lower. \nTreasury bill rates fell between March and December last year, mainly driven by foreign buying in treasury bonds, resulting in a decline in interest rates. \nThe country’s 2018 economic growth trajectory is likely to help boost market sentiment, analysts said. \nSri Lanka’s economic growth in 2018 is forecast at 5-5.5 percent, against an anticipated four-year low of less than 4 percent last year, central bank governor Indrajit Coomaraswamy said last week. $1 = 153.7500 Sri Lankan rupees Reporting by Ranga Sirilal and Shihar Aneez; Editing by Sherry Jacob-Phillips", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-10T14:22:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-10T14:41:49.015+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
