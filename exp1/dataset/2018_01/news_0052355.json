The corporation does not admit to paying women less than men for equal work. \nBut the PwC review’s findings are unlikely to satisfy aggrieved female staff. BBC Women said it had no confidence in the review. \nThe group provided 14 examples of women who described frustrating battles with managers over pay discrimination. \n“I have co-presented with a male colleague for many years ... I estimate he’s paid around double what I earn for doing the same job,” said one of the unnamed women in a typical submission. “I raised the equal pay issue many times over the years, but nothing was done.” PAY CUTS FOR MEN \nParliament’s media committee is due to hear oral evidence on Wednesday from Carrie Gracie, the BBC’s former China editor who quit this month in protest over being paid less than her male peers, and from BBC Director-General Tony Hall. \nThe BBC will propose a pay cap of 320,000 pounds ($450,000) per year for news presenters as part of a wider restructuring of pay, its own media editor reported on Tuesday. \nBut lawmaker Damian Collins, chair of the media committee, said the cap would have made no difference in Gracie’s case. Her annual pay as China editor was 135,000 pounds while her counterpart Jon Sopel, North America editor, was paid between 200,000 and 250,000. \nSopel was one of six high-profile male presenters and journalists who agreed to take pay cuts after Gracie’s resignation, but Collins said that would not address what he called “the lack of equal pay throughout the organisation”. \nThe pay issue has led to bizarre situations on BBC radio and TV, with some people whose own pay packages were part of the debate presenting news programmes covering the topic. \nOn the day when news of Gracie’s resignation broke, she was co-presenting the flagship morning radio programme Today with John Humphrys, a BBC veteran whose annual pay of over 600,000 pounds was one of the most controversial disclosures. \nHumphrys is one of the six men who have agreed to pay cuts.
