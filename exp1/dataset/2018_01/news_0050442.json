I thought if I just stayed patient, I’ll play good. So I just stayed patient all day.” \nAlexander Levy and Haydn Porteous were tied in third place at 17-under, a shot ahead of Andy Sullivan, who set the clubhouse target with a round of 63. \nEarly pace-setter David Horsey was then in sixth place on 15-under, ahead of a clutch of eight players by a single shot, including fellow Englishman Tyrell Hatton and South Africa’s Dylan Frittelli. \nMcIlroy, who returned to complete his second round in the morning and started his third with a two-shot lead, was pleased with the fight he showed to shrug off bogeys on the fourth and eighth holes. \n“I showed that even whenever I didn’t have my best stuff today I was able to battle around and get in at a decent score. So hopefully I have a bit of a better game tomorrow,” he said. \n“The back nine’s been good to me this week. I just need to figure out how to play the front a bit better.” Reporting by Simon Jennings in Bengaluru, editing by Pritha Sarkar", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-27T17:54:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-27T18:25:31.024+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
