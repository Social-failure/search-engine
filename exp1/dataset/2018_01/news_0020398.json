That is why the investigations are taking a long time and are tedious,” Thomas Schaefer, finance minister of the German state of Hesse, said in a statement. “But they are absolutely necessary and so far successful.” \nOf the 5.3 billion euros of unpaid taxes, the federal and state governments are already in the process of reclaiming 2.4 billion, the German finance ministry said.
