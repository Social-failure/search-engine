The company recorded a profit of 86.4 million pounds a year ago.\nComputacenter, which had been hurt by weakness in its domestic market as the United Kingdom prepared to leave the European Union, had said earlier it foresaw a drop in short-term demand for its products and services.\nShares of the company were up 2 percent at 0812 GMT.\nReporting by Justin George Varghese in Bengaluru; editing by Jason Neely and Gopakumar Warrier\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-22T09:48:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-22T10:06:28.030+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
