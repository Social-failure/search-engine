REUTERS/Tim Kelly Many Okinawa residents associate the U.S. military presence with crime, pollution and accidents, and resentment has been rekindled by a spate of incidents involving U.S. military aircraft. Last month a window fell from a U.S. helicopter onto a school sports field, fanning safety concerns.\nInamine, who is seeking a third four-year-term with opposition party support, is leading challenger Taketoyo Toguchi, 56, who has the backing of Abe’s Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) and its junior coalition partner, the Komeito party, according to a Yomiuri newspaper survey published on Tuesday.\nA win for Toguchi would make it easier for Abe’s government to move ahead with the relocation plan.\nWork is underway for construction of a Futenma replacement facility, but the Nago mayor’s approval is needed for some aspects so Inamine could cause further delays if re-elected.\nSixty-nine percent of Nago voters responding to Yomiuri’s survey said that Futenma’s functions should be moved off Okinawa entirely; 17 percent said the original plan should go ahead.\nReporting by Linda Sieg; Editing by Michael Perry\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-01-30T14:26:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-30T08:41:51.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
