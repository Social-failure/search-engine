Hun Sen, 65, is expected to win easily. \nThe CNRP was set up in 2012 to unify Sam Rainsy’s and Kem Sokha’s separate parties. Its success in a 2013 general election and local elections last year had shown what a powerful electoral force it had become. \nReporting by Prak Chan Thul; Editing by Michael Perry\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-20T07:42:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-20T08:11:39.008+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
