Both Montezemolo and Chief Executive Flavio Cattaneo, who plans to keep his own 5 percent stake in the company, believe Italo generates enough free cash flow to fund growth plans.

REUTERS/Max Rossi \nMontezemolo told Reuters Italo wanted to be ready for further expansion at home, and also to export its business model abroad once new EU rules come into force meant to open up passenger rail networks to competition and create a single market from 2020. \nItalo recently ordered 17 new EVO trains from French engineering group Alstom without issuing any new debt, raising its fleet to 42 and preparing for new routes, like the popular Turin-Venice connection that will be launched in May. \nCattaneo said Italo, a business with a core profit margin of around 35 percent, should be seen as an infrastructure firm with a predictable cost base. \nNeither executive would comment on a possible valuation for the company. But a share buy-back mandate approved last week implied a valuation of around 2 billion euros. \nA 500 million-euro bond issue last year attracted demand four times its size. Italo pledges to pay out between 50 and 70 percent of net profits as dividends over the next three years. \n“The market will decide the price. If we like it, we will list, if not, there is no obligation,” Cattaneo said.
