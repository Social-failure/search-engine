Carrefour has declined to comment.\nDejan Terglav, FO secretary general, told Reuters on Friday his union was calling for a day of protests on Feb. 8.\n“If the plan does not suit us, it will be war,” he warned.\nCarrefour is the largest private sector employer in France, with 115,000 French staff out of a global workforce of 384,000.
