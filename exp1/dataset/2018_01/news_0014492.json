But once we get into March that’s when the real preparations start.\n”There’s goals within each section of the season and in this section it’s to try and win a tournament out of these next four or five events.\n“Then as we go into the Masters I set a bar for March, April, May and then you get into each major.”\nSpieth will tee off alongside fellow Americans Xander Schauffele and Daniel Berger.\nReporting by Frank Pingue in Toronto, editing by Nick Mulvenney\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-11T03:24:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-11T03:40:25.006+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
