Then we need to integrate the business, and that will take 1-1.5 years.”\nSeparately, on its struggling T-Systems business, Dannenfeldt said a partial sale of the German IT services and consulting unit could not be ruled out.\nLast week, Deutsche Telekom announced plans to split T-Sytems into two separate units in a bid to halt a slide in earnings.\nReporting by Arno Schuetze; editing by Alexander Smith\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-01-20T23:20:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-20T17:23:58.007+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
