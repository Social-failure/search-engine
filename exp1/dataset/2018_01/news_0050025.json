He was admitted into the invitation-only association in 1990 and has been active ever since, including serving as President of the Dallas chapter in 1994, President of TEX-ABOTA (all Texas chapters) in 1999 and National President in 2007. He is the ninth recipient of this award in the organization's 60-year history.\n\"On occasion, one among us comes along whose service to ABOTA and to its principles is so exceptional, so selfless, so lengthy and so committed that we recognize them with the highest honor we can bestow,\" said National President Cynthia McGuinn when presenting the award.\nMr. Sifford has been a mainstay within ABOTA and has served as chair or co-chair of numerous committees. He has served on ABOTA's Executive Committee multiple times, as well as the Presidential Task Force, co-chair of Save Our Juries, chair of Professional Education Committee, and many others. He is currently a Trustee for the ABOTA Foundation.\n\"I am deeply honored to receive this wonderful award, but my greatest honor has been the opportunity to serve with so many outstanding men and women and to share with them our association's messages of ethics, civility and professionalism in the practice of law and the preservation of the Seventh Amendment,\" said Mr. Sifford. \"I offer my sincerest gratitude to all of them and my hope that I may always be mindful of the significance of this award and live an impactful life in honor of it.\"\nMr. Sifford was also the recipient of the ABOTA Foundation's Mark P.
