I couldn’t grasp a racket with one hand properly so I went with two.”\nROOM FOR IMPROVEMENT Hsieh was 22 when she made the fourth round of the 2008 Australian Open as a qualifier, eventually stopped by seven-times grand slam champion Justine Henin.\nA decade on, she will be the oldest player competing in the last 16, a fact she acknowledged somewhat reluctantly.\n“I look cute and young! I don’t think too much about the age thing,” she said.\nTennis - Australian Open - Margaret Court Arena, Melbourne, Australia, January 20, 2018.

I’ve been quite fortunate without serious injuries as well.\n“So I still think there is room for improvement.”\nA sharp increase in her ranking should help that late-blooming push, by putting her into more competitive tournaments.\nTaiwan lacks a world class tennis program and facilities, said Hsieh, and she can hone her game with few elite compatriots.\nKerber, with her former world number one ranking and two grand slam titles, is quite a step up from Taiwan’s number two, the 259th-ranked Chang Kai-chen.\nNot that Hsieh will be guilty of over-analysing the German.\n“She’s a great player, it’s fair to say she probably has the advantage with skill and power,” said Hsieh.\n”My advantage is that I am free-style.\n“I don’t really tend to go in with a game-plan, I kind of just do what comes naturally.”\nEditing by Toby Davis\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-21T16:05:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-21T16:14:45.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
