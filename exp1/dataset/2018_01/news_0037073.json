They stood at 184.6 billion riyals in May, before the embargo.\nBankers say the vast majority of the four countries’ deposits in Qatar have now been pulled out, leaving little money left to withdraw. Meanwhile, the Qatari economy’s stability since the embargo was imposed has helped banks attract money from other foreign depositors.\nTo protect the banks from deposit outflows, Qatar’s government has been pumping some of its own money into the banks. The Qatari public sector boosted its deposits in local banks by 7.1 billion riyals in December to 315.4 billion riyals.\nMeanwhile, Qatari banks owed banks outside the country 177.3 billion riyals in December, up from 176.7 billion riyals in November.\nQatari banks’ borrowing from foreign banks fell sharply in the initial months of the embargo as institutions from the four Arab countries stopped extending loans. But borrowing has started to edge up again as Qatari banks find other sources of loans in Asia and Europe.
