That topped the 9.7 percent annualized gain in the Standard & Poor’s 500 including dividends. Berkshire does not pay a dividend. \nBarclays on Monday also raised its price target for Berkshire Class A shares to $357,000 from $322,500, three weeks after the shares reached $300,000 for the first time. It raised its target for Berkshire Class B shares to $238 from $215. \nBerkshire usually releases year-end results and Buffett’s annual shareholder letter on the last Saturday in February. \nIn afternoon trading, Berkshire Class A shares were up $1,575 at $303,100, and Class B shares were up 64 cents at $202.06. Both share classes rose 22 percent in 2017.
