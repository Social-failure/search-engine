REUTERS/Stephen Lam/File Photo The Seoul Central District Prosecutors’ Office declined to comment when asked if it would launch an investigation into Apple following the complaint from the consumer group.\nApple Korea, the U.S. tech firm’s South Korean subsidiary, was not immediately available for comment.\nThe California-based company acknowledged in December that iPhone software can slow down some phones with battery problems and apologized for the issue. However, it said it would never do anything to intentionally shorten the life of any Apple product.\nApple will release a software update that will allow users to turn off a feature that slows down iPhones when batteries are low on charge, CEO Cook told ABC News on Wednesday. [nL1N1PD2BF]\nItaly’s antitrust body said on Thursday it had opened a probe into allegations that Apple and Samsung Electronics Co Ltd used software updates to slow their mobile phones and push clients into buying new handsets. [nL8N1PD685]\nA French prosecutor has also launched a preliminary investigation into Apple’s alleged deception and planned obsolescence of its products.
