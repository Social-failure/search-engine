The homes of Hong Kong’s new top legal official, Secretary for Justice Teresa Cheng, and her husband Otto Poon, where illegal structures including glasshouse, swimming pool and basement were discovered, are seen in Hong Kong, China January 10, 2018. REUTERS/Bobby Yip \nHong Kong’s leader Carrie Lam has defended Cheng publicly, saying she had not covered up anything. \nThe rule of law and an independent judiciary have long been seen as key pillars in the success of the former British colony that returned to Chinese rule in 1997 and enjoys a high degree of autonomy under a “one country, two systems” arrangement. \nIn recent years, however, China has weighed into the city’s legal system on a number of occasions, such as a legal interpretation that led to the disqualification of opposition lawmakers from the legislature. \nSeveral cases in which democracy activists and police officers were jailed have also provoked criticism of judges. Hundreds of lawyers held two rare protest marches in recent years to voice concerns about China’s interference. \nThe Buildings Department told Reuters its inspectors were initially barred from entering Cheng’s nearly $3-million villa when the scandal first broke. \nBut when allowed in on a repeat visit on Tuesday, the inspectors discovered nine unauthorized structures, including a basement, a swimming pool and a rooftop den with French windows in Cheng’s house and an adjoining one owned by her husband. \nLand records reviewed by Reuters show Cheng bought the property through a company called Sparkle Star Development Limited. Her husband, Otto Poon, who lives next door, bought his house in 2012. They married in 2016. \nCheng said a rectification proposal was submitted to the Buildings Department on Wednesday, adding that neither she nor her husband, a past president of the Hong Kong Institution of Engineers, was trained to identify illegal structures. \n“One doesn’t look at a thing and know whether it’s illegal,” said Cheng, who has been a member of government-linked housing panels and co-authored a book on construction law.
