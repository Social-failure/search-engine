The pound was as low as $1.3458 as recently as Jan. 11.\n“It seems the Brexit negotiations are starting to pan out. Some of the political uncertainties in the UK are starting to fade. It’s turning into a bit of a momentum rally,” said Martin Arnold, macro strategist at ETF Securities.\nAgainst the euro, which has rallied in recent weeks, the pound was down marginally at 88.22 pence per euro.\nBank of England policymaker Michael Saunders said on Wednesday that British unemployment was likely to fall further than most economists expected this year, pushing pay growth higher.\nWhile he stuck close to BoE language that any interest rate rises would be “limited and gradual”, some analysts believe the bank will be forced to tighten monetary policy faster inflation fails to fall as predicted.\nAdam Cole, chief currency strategist at RBC Capital Markets, said sterling “had really recoupled itself to monetary policy” in the current absence of Brexit-related noise, but he believed that as deadlines for a Brexit deal approached sterling would drop again as the difficulty of talks reemerged.\nHe also said the market was overly optimistic about the BoE following the U.S. in raising interest rates.\n“We think the market is mispricing rate hikes for the UK. We see sterling in the $1.20s in the medium term,” he said.
