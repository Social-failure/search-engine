Lawyers are not expecting a judgment imminently. \nWhen announcing its proposed ban in April 2016, the FCA had said Hussein “understood that Libor submissions should not be made for the benefit of trading positions” and “closed his mind to the risk” that his preferences for the Libor rates could influence submissions. “In so doing he acted recklessly and lacked integrity,” the FCA said. \nAuthorities have fined 11 financial institutions around $9.0 billion and charged about 30 people in a global inquiry into how banks set rates such as Libor and Euribor, which determine the rates on trillions of loans and financial contracts globally. \nThe FCA, along with U.S. and Swiss counterparts, fined UBS a total of $1.5 billion over Libor conduct in 2012. UBS said at the time it regretted what it called “inappropriate and unethical behavior.” \nThe case is listed until Jan. 9. Reporting by Kirstin Ridley.
