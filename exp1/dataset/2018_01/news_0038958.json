A paper articulating a clear sense of direction, and a desired end-state, could have boosted confidence that the government is up to the task”, Morgan said in a statement. \nFinancial services, which account for about 12 percent of Britain’s economic output, potentially have a lot to lose from the end of unfettered access to the EU market once Britain leaves in March 2019. \nBanks in London are setting up new hubs in the EU, but have said they may have to shift more staff and operations than they need unless there is clarity on what sort of new trading deal Britain will negotiate with the EU. \nBritain’s Department for Exiting the European Union declined to say if any services paper would ever be published. \n“We will keep under review what is the best way of advocating our position – be that in private discussions with the EU, speeches, or a formal position paper,” a spokesperson said. \nPrime Minister Theresa May’s spokesman told reporters: “We always let you know in the normal way if there is to be one.” \nStill, finance executives say relations with the government have improved since Britain and the EU last month agreed to the principle of a transition deal and to talks about future trade relationships. \nBankers had complained last year that their concerns were not being heard, but May told them this month they were a priority for her in Brexit talks.
