However, the measure of borrowing by medium-sized firms declined to 201.1 from 217.3.\nLending to small companies in the construction sector rose to 155.5 from 151.4, while transportation rose to 96.3 from 93.7.\nRetail companies also rose to 201.8 from 198.2, though the manufacturing sector continued to lag, with its index falling to 59.4 from 60.8.\nAlthough lending activity to small firms was down 1 percent compared to a year ago, the month-over-month gain is a positive sign that such firms could help lead economic growth, said PayNet President Bill Phelan.\n“The small businesses are the canary in the coal mine, the leading economic indicator,” Phelan said.\nAlthough the economy is expected to have moderated in the second half of 2017 after a blistering first half, fourth-quarter growth is still anticipated to be relatively robust.\nThe PayNet report showed companies’ financial health continued to look strong in November, with the number of firms that were delinquent by 30 days or more declining to 0.86 percent from 0.88 percent. Those that were 90 days or more behind also fell to 0.25 percent from 0.28 percent.\nReporting by Leah Schnurr\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-01-15T18:08:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-16T13:24:15.004+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
