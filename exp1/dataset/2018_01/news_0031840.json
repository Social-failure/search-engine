They are destabilising.” \nThe United States has instead called on Turkey to focus on the fight against Islamic State militants and not take military action in Afrin. \nReuters TV filmed Turkish artillery at the border village of Sugedigi firing on Friday morning into Afrin region, and the YPG militia said Turkish forces fired 70 shells at Kurdish villages between midnight and Friday morning. Shelling continued in the late afternoon, said Rojhat Roj, a YPG spokesman in Afrin. \nRoj said it was the heaviest Turkish bombardment since Ankara stepped up threats to take military action against the Kurdish region.

If they dare to attack, we are ready to bury them one by one in Afrin,” a YPG statement said. \nSeparately, Russia’s RIA news agency quoted Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov as saying that media reports on Russian military units withdrawing from the Afrin region had been denied, though he did specify who had denied them. \nTurkey had sent its military chief to Moscow on Thursday to seek approval for an air campaign in Afrin, although Damascus warned it could shoot down any Turkish planes in its skies. \n‘NO OTHER WAY’ People hold flags and carry a banner reading \"We condemn and denounce the attacks of the Turkish government against our people in Afrin\" during a protest against Turkish attacks on Afrin, in Hasaka, Syria, January 18, 2018. REUTERS/Rodi Said \nCanikli said Ankara was determined to destroy the Kurdish group. “All terror networks and elements in northern Syria will be eliminated. There is no other way,” he said. \n“The operation in central Afrin may last a long time, but the terrorist organisation will swiftly come undone there.” \nAlthough Canikli said no Turkish troops have gone into Afrin, Turkish newspapers said 20 buses carrying Free Syrian Army rebels crossed on Friday from Turkey into a Turkish-controlled part of northern Syria, on Afrin’s eastern flank.

The Turkish armed forces said several civilians wounded in the attack were taken to Turkey for treatment, and Turkish television footage showed rubble and damaged walls. \nTurkey has been angered by U.S. military support for the Kurdish YPG-dominated Syrian Democratic Forces which spearheaded the fight against Islamic State in Syria, and by an announcement that the United States would stay in Syria to train about 30,000 personnel in the swathe of eastern Syria under SDF control. \nTurkey says the YPG is a terrorist group and a branch of the outlawed Kurdistan Workers Party which has waged an insurgency in southeast Turkey for decades, and Canikli criticised Washington for its continued emphasis on countering Islamic State. \n“The threat of Daesh has been removed in both Syria and Iraq. With this reality out in the open, a ‘focus on Daesh’ statement is truly a meaningless remark,” he said.
