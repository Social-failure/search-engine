LVMH swooped last year on the couture part of the brand it did not already own, uniting it with the perfume and beauty parts of the Dior business.\nIts fashion and leather goods division - motored by Louis Vuitton, which accounts for more than half of the whole group’s profits - posted revenues of 15.5 billion euros in 2017, up 13 percent like-for-like.\nReporting by Sarah White and Pascale Denis, Editing by Dominique Vidalon and Elaine Hardcastle\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-01-26T00:56:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-25T23:10:41.018+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
