On Saturday, ESPN confirmed it has “cut ties” with both men following a month-long investigation into the accusations. \nCantor alleged in her lawsuit that McNabb had sent her inappropriate text messages while he worked at the network. Davis, she said, spoke to her in a lewd manner and rubbed his body against hers while employed there. \nFellow NFL Network analysts Marshall Faulk, Ike Taylor and Heath Evans were also named in the lawsuit, and were placed on suspension in December, according to ESPN.
