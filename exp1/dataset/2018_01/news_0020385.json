He’s hitting the ball brilliantly. Wins four or five matches at the Hopman Cup against high-level competition. To me, he’s the clear favorite.”\nBookmakers are also expecting the world number two to successfully defend his title.\nFederer ($2.75 AUD) is the favorite to win the tournament, according to Australian Gambling, with world number one and last year’s Australian Open runner-up Nadal ($5.50) trailing him.\n“He could always get picked off early,” McEnroe said.\n“But based on what I’ve seen so far... I don’t think there’s anybody else that you could say is a favorite other than Roger at the moment.”\nESPN analyst and former world number one Chris Evert said his experience and smooth style of play, which has left him relatively injury-free, set him apart from the field.\n“This is a guy who is so relaxed... I think that affects him mentally as well as physically,” she said.\n“Mentally and emotionally, having kids, having a family, he gets away from the game. He knows how to compartmentalize really well.”\n“He lets the losses roll off his back, there’s no tension there. I think he has a real joy for the game,” she said.\n“That’s what makes Federer, Federer.”\nThe Australian Open runs from Jan. 15-28.\nReporting by Rory Carroll, editing by Ed Osmond\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-10T23:48:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-11T00:07:23.002+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
