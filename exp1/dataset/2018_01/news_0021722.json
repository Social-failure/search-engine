It has shed 1.4 percent in the past five sessions. \n“The market is coming down on profit-taking by local retailers in blue chips before the next rally after the election,” said Dimantha Mathew, head of research, First Capital Holdings. \n“The good sign is that foreign buying continues, it looks like foreign investors are returning back to the Sri Lankan market.” \nForeign investors bought shares worth net 539.3 million rupees ($3.51 million) on Tuesday, extending the net foreign inflow so far this year to 2.87 billion rupees. \nThey had net bought 18.5 billion rupees worth equities in 2017 and 633.5 million rupees in 2016. \nTurnover stood at 884.6 million rupees on Tuesday, less than last year’s daily average of 915.3 million rupees. \nShares in Hatton National Bank Plc fell 1.2 percent, Commercial Bank of Ceylon Plc dropped 1.1 percent, and Nestle Lanka Plc slipped 1.1 percent. \nSri Lanka’s stock, bond, and foreign exchange markets were closed on Monday for a holiday.
