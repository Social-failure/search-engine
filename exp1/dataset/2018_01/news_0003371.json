It also comes amid industry concerns about the risks potentially posed by allowing futures in volatile virtual currencies to be traded alongside more traditional financial products.\nCFTC Chairman Christopher Giancarlo said the regulator is aware of the “considerable risks” that come with cryptocurrencies like bitcoin. But the CFTC noted that there is no law or rule that would have prevented CME Group Inc and CBOE Global Markets Inc from listing bitcoin futures contracts. The pair of advisory committee meetings are aimed at giving stakeholders the opportunity to discuss the issue.\nReporting by Pete Schroeder; Editing by Jonathan Oatis\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-04T19:21:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-04T19:32:59.023+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
