Wall Street analysts expected 41 cents. \nRevenue rose to $1.36 billion from $289.1 million a year ago, but Wall Street analysts on average expected revenue of $1.37 billion. \nThe company’s quarterly results include a $364.2 million income tax benefit resulting from changes to U.S. tax law. \nJackson also said capacity for third-party carriers has started to tighten due to a U.S. regulation that trucking companies use electronic logging devices, known as ELDs, to track the number of hours drivers are behind the wheel. \nJackson said the company expects “to achieve our synergy goals” following last year’s merger of Swift Transportation Co and Knight Transportation Inc, a stock-swap deal that created a company with a present market value of more than $8.31 billion.
