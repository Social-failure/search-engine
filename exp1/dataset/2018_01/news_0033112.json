Ping An and SoftBank declined to comment when contacted by Reuters, while SBI did not respond to requests for comment. \nPing An later said in a filing with the Shanghai stock exchange that it would seek “all kinds of external financing for certain technology businesses when appropriate in the future in order to maximise shareholders’ value”, without elaborating further. \nSoftBank’s investment is its latest bet on Ping An, a Shenzhen-based financial conglomerate whose businesses also include banking, securities and investment. \nThe Japanese technology and investment group has also invested in Good Doctor and Finance One Account, a finance unit under Ping An, the second source said. \nSet up in late 2016, Ping An Healthcare Management provides support to China’s public medical insurance services and guidance on medical fees with its health data system, according to Ping An’s website. \nIt aims to become China’s largest open platform for healthcare services such as medical treatment, social health insurance (SHI) and drug distribution, the group’s 2016 annual report showed. \nBy the end of this year, the unit is expected to provide 5,000 hospitals in about 220 cities across China with SHI services and health records, which is in line with government efforts to cut medical costs, the first source said. \nIt is projecting a net profit of $150 million for 2018 and $175 million for next year, the source added. \nGoldman Sachs was the financial adviser on the funding round, the sources said. The Wall Street Bank declined to comment. \nLufax is expected to sell $6 billion to $9 billion of shares in its IPO, and is seeking a valuation of $60 billion, the South China Morning Post reported on Monday. Good Doctor has hired banks for an IPO of up to $1 billion.
