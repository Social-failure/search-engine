The stock has jumped 57 percent in the past year, exceeding the performance of each of the five most valuable tech companies except for Amazon, which has climbed 60 percent. \nRevenue has increased by more than 12 percent in each of the past three quarters. \nTexas Instruments is benefiting from growth in the automobile industry, where there's rising demand for new applications and processors as well as continued expansion in consumer devices and industrial machinery. \nThe change will take place June 1, as part of a \"well-planned succession,\" the company said, that follows Crutcher's promotion to operating chief last year and his election to the board in July.
