She belonged to a family that lost several members in the disaster.\n“The Sheriff’s Office wants to express our deepest condolences to the Benitez family, who were already mourning the loss of Faviola’s 10-year-old son, Jonathan Benitez and his cousin 3-year-old Kailly Benitez, as well as Kailly’s mother, 27-year-old Marilyn Ramos,” the office said in a statement.\nThe discovery of Calderon’s body brought the number of fatalities to 21. The toll had already marked the greatest loss of life from a California mudslide in at least 13 years.\nReporting by Chris Kenning in Chicago; Editing by Daniel Wallis\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-22T01:40:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-22T01:55:55.001+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
