It noted that Trump’s comments had immediately sparked “controversy and indignation”.\nTrump denies using the term.\nImmigration is one of the issues that Pope Francis, who has strongly defended the rights of developing countries, and Trump have clashed over.\nIn 2016, in response to a question about then-candidate Trump’s views on immigration and his intention to build a wall along the U.S. border with Mexico, Francis said a man with such views was “not Christian”.\nTrump, who grew up in a Presbyterian family, shot back saying it was “disgraceful” for the pope to question his faith.
