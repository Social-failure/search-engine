The army, which is not under the control of the civilian government, launched a sweeping counteroffensive in northern Rakhine in response to Rohingya militant attacks on Aug. 25, triggering an exodus of more than 650,000 Rohingya villagers to Bangladesh.\nAsked if the revelations about the killing at the village of Inn Din, about 50 km (30 miles) north of the state capital Sittwe, could be a concern for refugees who are being asked to return, Suu Kyi said: ”Some people might be afraid, but this is not something that has happened right now.\nJapanese Foreign Minister Taro Kono and Myanmar's leader Aung San Suu Kyi attend a news conference in Naypyidaw, Myanmar January 12, 2018.

So doing this investigation is a deterrent so that similar cases don’t happen later.”\nSuu Kyi was speaking following a meeting in Myanmar’s capital Naypyidaw at which Kono asked her to ensure the “safe and voluntary” resettlement of those who have fled, according to Japanese news agency Kyodo.\nSlideshow (2 Images) The Japanese foreign minister said Tokyo, one of Myanmar’s biggest foreign aid donors, planned to give about $20 million for humanitarian support to Rohingya refugees, subject to parliamentary approval, Kyodo said.\n“Japan wants to actively support Myanmar’s efforts,” Kyodo Quote: d Kono as telling the news conference.\nMyanmar and Bangladesh have been discussing a plan to repatriate the refugees.\nPrior to the joint news conference, the Japanese government announced emergency grant aid of around $3 million to Myanmar to help facilitate the return of the Rohingya.\n($1 = 111.2200 yen)\nReporting by Kiyoshi Takenaka in Tokyo, Shoon Naing in Singapore and Simon Lewis in Yangon; Editing by Raju Gopalakrishnan and Alex Richardson\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-12T07:17:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-12T07:30:47.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
