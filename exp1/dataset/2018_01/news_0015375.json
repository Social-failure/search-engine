But advocates said they believe dozens, if not hundreds, of transgender people will seek to join an estimated 4,000 already serving.\nAspiring transgender military service members in several U.S. states told Reuters they were pushing ahead with enlistments despite lingering uncertainty about whether they would be welcome in the future.\n“I‘m not worried,” said Logan Downs, 23, an Oregon transgender man working to join the Air Force.\nTrump caught the Pentagon off-guard when he tweeted in July that transgender people would be banned from serving in the armed forces, citing healthcare costs and unit disruption.\nThe Obama Administration had decided in June 2016 to allow transgender service members to serve openly, and a deadline of Jan. 1, 2018 was later set to begin accepting recruits. The decision came five years after the military ended its ban on gays serving openly, scrapping the “don’t ask, don’t tell” policy adopted by the Clinton administration in 1994.\nTrump’s reversal also blocked government-funded sex-reassignment surgery and other treatments for active-duty personnel.\nBut federal judges in Baltimore and Washington, where civil rights groups filed lawsuits against the policy in August, blocked Trump’s move.\nNicholas Bade, 37, who is among the transgender Americans who this month can enlist openly in the U.S. military for the first time after courts blocked President Donald TrumpÕs effort to re-establish a ban on transgender service members, poses outside a recruitment center in Chicago, Illinois, U.S., January, 4, 2018.

REUTERS/Chris Kenning A Pentagon review of the issue will be finalized in February and forwarded to Trump, who is expected to make a decision on the future of transgender personnel in March.\n“We’re definitely not out of the woods yet, but we have so much momentum,” said Nicolas Talbott, 24, of Lisbon, Ohio, one of the transgender people who challenged the ban in court.\nThis week, he planned to finish his Air Force National Guard enlistment paperwork, he said.\nBianca Wright, of Seattle, has eagerly waited to re-enlist after leaving the military and pursuing a gender transition following 14 years of service, including deployments to Iraq.\nSlideshow (2 Images) After Trump’s declaration, “that all came crashing down,” she said.\nCritics of Trump’s ban pointed to a Rand Corporation study that estimated annual transgender healthcare accounted for only $2.4 million to $8.4 million of the more than $50 billion in Defense Department healthcare spending.\nRand also found 18 other countries allowed transgender members to serve, and Australia, Canada, Israel and the United Kingdom saw little or no impact on operational effectiveness.\nStarting this month at U.S. recruiting offices, transgender individuals can note if their gender identity does match their gender at birth and disclose related surgeries or treatments on medical forms without being disqualified, said Gaylan Johnson, a spokesman at the U.S. Military Entrance Processing Command.\nOnce in the military, where gender determines housing, uniforms and physical fitness requirements, such recruits would use bathrooms and facilities aligned with their identity, Johnson said.\nWhat kind of acceptance they find from boot camp to active duty may vary by unit, said Zander Keig, a Transgender American Veterans Association board member.\nBade, the Chicago enlistee, said, “The people I know in the military have said, ‘I don’t care what your gender identity is, as long as you can do your job.'”\nReporting by Chris Kenning, Editing by Colleen Jenkins and Richard Chang\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-14T17:38:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-14T17:55:52.007+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
