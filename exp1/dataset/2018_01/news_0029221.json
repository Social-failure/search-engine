At least 31 people have died in violent protests. \n“Out with JOH, out with the dictator,” masked protesters shouted in Tegucigalpa’s Miraflores neighbourhood.

REUTERS/Jorge Cabrera \nThe Honduran electoral tribunal declared Hernandez, a staunch U.S. ally, the official winner of the election last month despite strident protests over the vote count. \nInitially, the vote tally had clearly favoured center-left opposition candidate Salvador Nasralla, but it swung in favour of the incumbent after a 36-hour delay. \nHernandez is due to take office on Jan. 27. \n“We have to stay in the streets,” said former President Manuel Zelaya, who was ousted in a 2009 coup and is one of the opposition leaders. \n“If they move us from one spot, we have to move to another. We need to be permanently mobilized to keep up the pressure and prevent the dictator from installing himself.” Writing by Gabriel Stargardter; Editing by Lisa Von Ahn", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-20T21:09:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-20T21:23:13.026+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
