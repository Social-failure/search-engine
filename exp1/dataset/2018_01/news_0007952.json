Here's your closing snapshot : (Julien Ponthus) CONSENSUS NOT A DANGEROUS PLACE TO BE (1622 GMT) Consensus is only a dangerous place to be when you are approaching an inflection point, says Chris Godding, CIO of Tilney, which manages more than 20 billion pounds' worth of clients' money. And by consensus Godding means expecting 2018 to be another year of very strong global economic and earnings growth. \"When we look at the world ... we find it very difficult to come up with a solid reason to think that the trend, or the consensus, is going to be different or it's going to be wrong,\" Godding says. He adds that while the potential inflection point was a change in liquidity provided by central banks, we have only just started achieving synchronized global growth. \"This is another reason to think that maybe itâ€™s not all over just yet.\" (Kit Rees) JUST 9 DAYS INTO 2018, S&P 500 TOPS FORECASTS (1615 GMT) The ongoing stock market rally is taking many by surprise and only nine days into the new year, the U.S. benchmark index has already risen above the year-end forecasts of Morgan Stanley, Scotiabank, Stifel and HSBC. In the snapshot the forecasts for the S&P 500 from 19 top brokers, courtesy of a trader. More broadly, the MSCI all-country world index is also offering a bullish picture. Just nine days in, the index is on track for its best month since July 2016. (Danilo Masoni) PLAYING FIAT CHRYSLER THROUGH EXOR? WHY NOT! (1608 GMT) Dealmaking talk has put Fiat Chrysler on a roll but for some investors it's safer to play the story through Exor, the holding company of Italy's Agnelli family which controls the automaker along with big holdings in other valuable assets including truck maker CNH Industrial , reinsurer Partner RE and Ferrari. Among them is Andrea Scauri, fund manager at Milan-based Ifigest. \"Exor's 30 percent discount to NAV is higher than the average. Considering that there is also the optionality that CNH could sells assets, I believe Exor offers more long-term value and lower volatility than Fiat at the moment,\" he says. Scauri adds that Exor could benefit from an increase in premiums at Partner Re following damages linked to hurricanes in the U.S. While Fiat has gained 24 percent in just four days, Exor has gained a respectable 13 percent. (Danilo Masoni) FIAT CHRYSLER RACES HIGHER IN HEAVY VOLUMES AS AUTOS EXCITEMENT DRIVES TRADING (1436 GMT) The Italian carmaker's shares are on a dizzying ride, up 24 percent in just four days, as dealmaking bets drive autos even higher. A Morgan Stanley note yesterday talked up Fiat's Jeep brand and the possibility of a spin-off, boosting its shares higher. Here's our story on Jeep growth expectations from yesterday: Investors are certainly piling into the stock: no fewer than 100 million shares - around 10 percent of the stock's free float - have changed hands in the past four days of trading. \"Something is cooking,\" says a London-based trader focusing in special situations. Also helping drive the autos sector sharply higher is Continental, boosted to a record high by a report on a possible breakup of the car parts maker. For what it's worth over (nearly) six days of trading, the autos sector is easily Europe's best-performing so far in 2018. (Helen Reid) BANKING MERGERS: A LITTLE LESS CONVERSATION, PLEASE? (1340 GMT) While M&A is powering markets (biotech has seen a flurry of bids since the beginning of the year), the banking sector isn't joining the rush. Quite the opposite... Speculation of a possible deal uniting Commerzbank with the likes of BNP Paribas , SocGen or UniCredit has subsided and investors don't appear to anticipate an imminent move. In its monthly newsletter, fund Axiom AI, which invests in banking securities, said it was not holding its breath: \"Consolidation will be a hot topic but should remain marginal\". Berenberg equity sales traders also note that some of Commerzbank's 54 percent overperformance since the beginning of 2017 can be credited to M&A rumours, but stress a tie-up is not a safe bet. \"While the market has speculated that Commerzbank may be involved in M&A, we see cross-border consolidation as unlikely, particularly given regulation opposition\", they said, adding that \"material in-market consolidation in Germany is unlikely...\" For \"A little less conversation (and), a little more action\", it's this way: bit.ly/1zYh2xS (Julien Ponthus and Helen Reid) \"THE RETURN OF PRICING POWER\" (1331 GMT) Subdued inflation is making central banks comfortable in making only gradual steps towards policy normalisation, but from the corporate world there are scattered signs here and there of prices going up. Earlier on we told you about two big Chinese beer firms raising prices in their country. Well today we also have two brokers saying luxury groups will have stronger pricing power going forward following a 2017 driven mainly by volume growth. \"2018 will see a return of pricing power for some players. The recent price increases at industry leaders such as Gucci, Chanel and Hermes seem to confirm that trend,\" says Berenberg. Bernstein too says pricing power is back: \"Given better demand and more balanced price differentials between regions, brands that are enjoying strong momentum will most likely resume price increases.\" (Danilo Masoni) MIDDAY SNAPSHOT: EUROPEAN STOCKS HOLD AT 2 1/2-YEAR HIGHS (1225 GMT) Halfway through the session, and that boost from the miners Helen just wrote about is helping European stocks stay at their highest levels since August 2015. Over in the U.S., stocks futures are signalling that Wall St is also set to make gains today, with futures up 0.1-0.2 percent. Here's your snapshot: (Kit Rees) HOLD MY BEER WHILE I ENJOY A LIGHT \"MARLBORO TUESDAY\" (1214 GMT) Remember how in 1993, Philip Morris' decision to cut prices to defend its market share triggered a sell-off across consumer staples? Well, in a modest manner and in the opposite direction, it seems European beer makers are enjoying a similar moment after China Resources Beer and Tsingtao Brewery decided to raise prices in their country. \"A stronger pricing environment in China is positive for European alcoholic beverage companies. In our beverage universe, Carlsberg (12%), AB InBev (10%), Remy (19%) and Pernod (11%) boast the highest China sales,\" Liberum analysts noted on Monday. As you can see below, AB InBev, Carlsberg and Heineken are outperforming the food ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-09T09:45:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-09T10:15:22.001+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
