Jung Dong-hyun and Kim Dong-woo were named as the men’s representatives. \nYonhap said Kyung had been the only alpine skiing representative at the launch of Team Korea last Wednesday and that he only found out he had been overlooked for the Games shortly afterwards. \nYonhap quoted KSA vice-president Lee Jae-chan as saying the selection process had been legitimate but Kyung’s presence at the launch ceremony was a mistake. \n“We admit that it was a reckless decision to make Kyung attend the national team launch ceremony even though his Olympic participation wasn’t confirmed,” he said.
