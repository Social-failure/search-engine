It also shipped 22,500 bpd to the United Kingdom, the data showed.\nThe country’s crude oil imports from the United States rose 127,000 bpd to 413,000 bpd, while total imports climbed 51,000 bpd to 635,000 bpd.\nCanada also imported crude oil from Saudi Arabia, Nigeria and Norway in November.\nRefineries in eastern Canada often import crude from overseas because it is easier to ship barrels by tanker to the Atlantic coast than move them on congested export pipelines and railroads from western Canadian oilfields.\nReporting by Nia Williams; Editing by Andrew Hay\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-01-06T00:44:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-05T22:24:22.018+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
