The median forecast for the key rate at the end of this year is 2.75 percent.\nMonday’s move would also boost the bank’s deposit and lending facility rates to 1.0 percent and 3.0 percent, from 0.75 and 2.75 percent respectively.\nGovernor Mugur Isarescu is expected to provide details on the decision from 1300 GMT.
