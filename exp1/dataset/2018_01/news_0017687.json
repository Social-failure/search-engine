Oprah Winfrey speaks after accepting the Cecil B. Demille Award at the 75th Golden Globe Awards in Beverly Hills, California, U.S. January 7, 2018. Paul Drinkwater/Courtesy of NBC/Handout via REUTERS \nWinfrey confidante Gayle King said on “CBS This Morning” that the 63-year-old celebrity’s past position that she was not interested in running for president remained unchanged. \n“I do think she’s intrigued by the idea, I do think that,” King said. “I also know that after years of watching ‘The Oprah (Winfrey) Show’ you always have the right to change your mind. I don’t think at this point she’s actually considering it.” \nSocial media lit up about a presidential run after Winfrey’s speech at the Golden Globes awards show on Sunday night promoting the “Time’s Up” movement against sexual harassment and assault. \nCNN, citing two of her close friends, reported on Monday that the television and movie producer and actress was actively thinking about making a White House bid. \nRepublican President Donald Trump would gladly face Winfrey - one of the United States’ wealthiest women and long associated with Democratic politics and fundraising - as in the 2020 presidential race, a White House spokesman said on Monday.
