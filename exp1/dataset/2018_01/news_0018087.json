The community (formerly known as AER Luxury Apartments) is an 18-story high rise in downtown St. Petersburg built in 2016 featuring extensive rooftop and ground floor amenities, retail space and a 5-story parking garage. Located just two blocks from the waterfront, the property is walkable to many downtown office buildings, the waterfront district and several popular entertainment venues. The community will be renamed Camden Pier District.\n“We are pleased to announce the acquisition of this premier asset located in one of our core markets,” said Richard J. Campo, Camden’s Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. “We believe the purchase price is 5-10% below current replacement cost, and the acquisition will produce a yield of approximately 5% in its first full year of stabilization after lease-up is completed later this year.”\nIn addition to historical information, this press release contains forward-looking statements under the federal securities law.
