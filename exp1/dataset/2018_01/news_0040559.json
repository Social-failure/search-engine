That’s one of the ones that hurt extra because it was going into the finals of a grand slam.” FEELING LUCKY \nWozniacki spent 67 weeks as world number one and is the only player to have won more than 25 WTA titles without claiming a major title.

REUTERS/Edgar Su \nShe lost six successive tour finals in 2017 but showed a more aggressive edge to her game when she saved two match points to battle back from 5-1 down in the third set to win her second round match against Jana Fett last week. \n“As I said early on in the week, I could have been home already,” said Wozniacki, who was clearly feeling lucky. \n“We’ve been at the casino a couple of times, won a couple hundred dollars,” added the Dane, after securing at least a A$2 million ($1.62 million) cheque by making the final. The winner gets A$4 million. \n“I‘m on a plus so far. We may go in and play a couple of hundred again, see how it goes.” \nVictory over Halep would take her back to the top of the world rankings but, having lost both her previous grand slam finals, finally landing a major title would mean far more. \n“I believe if you really put everything into it, eventually things are going to go your way,” she said. “Win or lose, I‘m going to be very proud of my efforts these two weeks.” ($1 = A$1.2375)", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-25T07:19:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-25T07:31:38.003+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
