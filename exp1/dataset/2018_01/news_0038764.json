Sturzenegger’s comments were widely interpreted as dovish and sent the peso currency tumbling amid expectations of a cut.\n“The continuation of the disinflationary process as 2018 begins benefits from more favorable initial conditions than in 2017,” the bank said in the statement. “The contractionary bias in monetary policy is greater, with a real interest rate much higher than at the beginning of 2017.”\nIn late December, Argentina changed its 2018 inflation target to 15 percent, up from 8-12 percent previously, giving the central bank margin to cut rates.\nIn the statement, the central bank said that while its high frequency indicators were giving “mixed signals” about the evolution of prices, the current contractionary bias of monetary policy is “still somewhat elevated.”\nReporting by Luc Cohen; Editing by Chris Reese and Sandra Maler\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-01-24T05:02:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-24T15:23:33.010+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
