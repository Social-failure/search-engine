Corbis Corbis/VCG via Getty Images By Jamie Ducharme 12:15 PM EST \nYou could be the proud owner of one of Apple’s earliest computers — if you have at least $55,000 to spare. \nAn eBay user is auctioning off a rare working Apple Lisa 1 , which, when it hit the market in 1983, was the first commercial computer with a graphical user interface. Bids on the machine, which boasts a drive for Apple’s short-lived Twiggy floppy disks , will be accepted until Jan. 14, and had reached $55,100 by Saturday. \nThe Lisa 1, named for Steve Jobs’ daughter, was largely considered a flop for Jobs and Apple , according to a Wired retrospective . It cost the company $150 million to develop the model, but only 10,000 units — priced at $10,000 each — sold. The model was pulled from the market after only three years, Wired writes, and Jobs was eventually yanked from the project to focus on a new effort: the Macintosh. \n“The Lisa was a milestone in history of the modern art [of] computers and is nowadays one of the rarest machines existing,” the eBay post reads. “Collectors guess between 20-100 are left on our planet.” \nWhile the machine is probably best as a collector’s item, the eBay auctioneer assures buyers that the Lisa is in good working order, right down to its Twiggy drives. \n“This Lisa 1 is optically and technically in excellent condition,” the post reads. “Both twiggy drives are working and spinning perfectly.” SPONSORED FINANCIAL CONTENT", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-06T14:15:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-06T19:26:35.004+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
