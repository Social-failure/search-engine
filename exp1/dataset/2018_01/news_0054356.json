Home & Building Products (“HBP”) revenue increased 40% and, as expected, Telephonics Corporation (\"Telephonics\") revenue decreased 25% compared to the prior year quarter.\nIncome from continuing operations was $22.8 million, or $0.53 per share, compared to $7.0 million, or $0.17 per share, in the prior year quarter. Current quarter results included tax benefits, net, for certain tax items which affect comparability (see tax section below) of $23.0 million, or $0.53 per share, acquisition related costs of $3.2 million ($2.3 million net of tax, or $0.05 per share) and the cost of a life insurance benefit of $2.6 million ($0.2 million net of tax, or $0.01 per share). The prior year quarter results included a discrete tax benefit, net, of $4.4 million, or $0.10 per share. Excluding these items from the respective quarterly results, income from continuing operations would have been $2.4 million, or $0.06 per share, compared to $2.6 million, or $0.06 per share, in the prior year quarter.\nSegment adjusted EBITDA was $43.7 million, an increase of 9% from the prior year quarter primarily driven by HBP revenue growth, partially offset by the impact of Telephonics' revenue decline. Segment adjusted EBITDA is defined as net income excluding interest income and expense, income taxes, depreciation and amortization and unallocated amounts (mainly corporate overhead), restructuring charges, loss on debt extinguishment and acquisition related expenses, as well as other items that may affect comparability, as applicable.\nRonald J. Kramer, Chief Executive Officer, commented, “We are off to a solid start in the first quarter of fiscal 2018 as we continue to execute our strategic initiatives, including the integration of ClosetMaid and our four recent tuck-in acquisitions at AMES. Our businesses are performing well and we are working to further improve our operational efficiencies and enhance future profitability.\" Mr. Kramer added, \"We are planning for the closing next week of our Clopay Plastics sale and the receipt of $475 million in cash.\"\nSegment Operating Results\nHome & Building Products\nRevenue was $371.0 million, an increase of 40% compared to the prior year quarter primarily due to the acquisition of ClosetMaid and AMES' acquisitions of Tuscan Path, La Hacienda, Hills and Harper. Favorable mix and price increases at CBP as well as increased shipments of Canadian snow tools and certain pots and planters further contributed to the favorable variance.\nSegment adjusted EBITDA was $39.5 million, an increase of 24% compared to the prior year quarter driven by increased revenue as noted above.\nOn October 2, 2017, Griffon completed the acquisition of ClosetMaid, a market leader of home storage and organization products, for approximately $185.7 million inclusive of post-closing adjustments, or $165 million net of the estimated present value of tax benefits under the current tax law. ClosetMaid adds to Griffon's Home and Building Products segment, complementing and diversifying Griffon's portfolio of leading consumer brands and products. ClosetMaid is expected to generate approximately $300 million in revenue in the first twelve months after the acquisition.\nOn November 6, 2017, AMES acquired Harper Brush Works (“Harper”), a division of Horizon Global, for approximately $5 million. Harper is a leading U.S. manufacturer of cleaning products for professional, home, and industrial use. The acquisition will broaden AMES’ long-handled tool offerings in North America to include brooms, brushes, and other cleaning tools and accessories. The acquisition is expected to contribute approximately $10 million in revenue in the first twelve months after the acquisition.\nDuring fiscal 2017, AMES acquired Tuscan Path on September 29, 2017, for approximately $18 million (AUD 22.3 million), La Hacienda on July 31, 2017, for approximately $11.4 million (GBP 9.2 million) and Hills on December 30, 2016, for approximately $6.1 million (AUD 8.4 million).\nTelephonics\nRevenue was $66.3 million, a decrease of 25% from the prior year quarter as expected, primarily due to decreased maritime surveillance radar and airborne intercommunications systems revenue.\nSegment adjusted EBITDA was $4.2 million compared to $8.1 million in the prior year quarter, driven by the decreased revenue.\nContract backlog was $332 million at December 31, 2017, compared to $351 million at September 30, 2017, with approximately 70% expected to be fulfilled within the next twelve months. The decrease in backlog was primarily due to the timing of various US and international contract awards associated with radar and surveillance opportunities.\nTaxes\nIn the quarter ended December 31, 2017, the Company recognized a tax benefit of $24.9 million on a Loss before taxes from continuing operations of $2.1 million, compared to a tax benefit of $2.6 million on Income before taxes from continuing operations of $4.4 million in the comparable prior year quarter.\nThe quarters ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 tax rates included net tax benefits that affect comparability of $23.0 million and $4.4 million, respectively. The current year quarter ended December 31, 2017 discrete tax benefits included a $23.9 million benefit from the revaluation of net deferred tax liabilities resulting from the December 22, 2017 enactment of the tax reform bill. The prior year quarter ended December 31, 2016 included discrete tax benefits from the adoption of Financial Accounting Standards Board guidance which requires the company to recognize excess tax benefits from the vesting of equity awards within income tax expense. Excluding these tax items, the effective tax rates for the quarters ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 were 35.4% and 40.8%, respectively.\nU.S. Tax Reform: On December 22, 2017, the U.S. government enacted comprehensive tax legislation commonly referred to as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “Tax Act”). The Tax Act reduces the federal corporate tax rate on U.S. earnings to 21% and moves from a global taxation regime to a modified territorial regime. As Griffon has a September 30 fiscal year-end, the lower tax rate will be phased in, resulting in a U.S. statutory federal rate of approximately 24.5% for fiscal year ending September 30, 2018. Subsequent fiscal years will reflect the 21% federal tax rate. However, there are offsets to the lower tax rate, the most significant being the loss of the domestic manufacturing deduction and the deductibility of certain incentive compensation for executives. Griffon will continue to assess the impact of the tax reform through the balance of fiscal 2018.\nClopay Plastics\nOn November 16, 2017, Griffon entered into a definitive agreement to sell Clopay Plastic Products Company (“Clopay Plastics”) to Berry Global Group, Inc. (NYSE:BERY) for $475 million in cash. The transaction is subject to regulatory approval and customary closing conditions, and is expected to close in February 2018.\nBalance Sheet and Capital Expenditures\nAt December 31, 2017, the Company had cash and equivalents of $84 million, total debt outstanding of $1,251 million, net of discounts and issuance costs, and $187.3 million available for borrowing under its revolving credit facility, subject to certain loan covenants. Capital expenditures were $10.8 million in the current quarter.\nShare Repurchases\nIn August 2016, Griffon’s Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to $50 million of Griffon’s outstanding common stock. Under these programs, the Company may purchase shares in the open market, including pursuant to a 10b5-1 plan, or in privately negotiated transactions. During the quarter ended December 31, 2017, Griffon did not repurchase any shares under the program. At December 31, 2017, $49.4 million remained under existing Board authorizations.\nFrom August 2011 to December 31, 2017, Griffon repurchased 20,429,298 shares of its common stock for a total of $261.6 million or $12.81 per share.\nConference Call Information\nThe Company will hold a conference call today, January 31, 2018, at 8:30 AM ET.\nThe call can be accessed by dialing 1-888-378-4439 (U.S. participants) or 1-323-794-2149 (International participants).
