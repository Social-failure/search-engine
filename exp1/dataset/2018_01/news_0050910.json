Marc von Waldkirch, another ETH-trained physicist, is chief executive.\nWith around 730 employees around the world, Sensirion competes in fragmented markets against rivals including well-established companies Honeywell ( HON.N ), Germany’s Robert Bosch ROBG.UL, Texas-based Silicon Labs ( SLAB.O ) and Japan’s Horiba ( 6856.T ).\nSensirion’s sensors are used in cars, mobile phones, hospitals and petrochemicals plants, as well as aboard the International Space Station, the company said.\nIt sells its sensors via large distributors including DigiKey Corp, Mouser Electronics, Conrad and Arrow Electronics.\n($1 = 0.9347 Swiss francs)\nAdditional reporting by Oliver Hirt and John Miller in Zurich; Editing by Michael Shields\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-01-30T20:02:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-30T16:32:04.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
