That leaves a planned deficit of 3 billion riyals this year, the same as last year’s projected deficit.\nThe 2018 budget assumes an average oil price of $50 per barrel, up from an assumption of $45 for 2017. The Brent oil price is now above $65, so Oman’s revenues are likely to be significantly higher than expected if oil prices stay flat.
