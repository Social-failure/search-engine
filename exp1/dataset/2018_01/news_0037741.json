But the premier remains hesitant to set a binding cap on spending, as he focuses more on growth than austerity to revive the economy and restore fiscal health. \nSome analysts say a delay in the primary budget target isn’t problematic because the economy is enjoying its best run of growth in a decade and tax revenue has been rising. \nAbe’s government last month compiled a 97.7 trillion yen budget - a record high for the sixth year - for fiscal 2018, led by bulging welfare spending due to an aging population and the cost of servicing snowballing debt.
