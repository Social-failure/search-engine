But Monday's earnings report comes amid challenges for the company. \nOn one hand, prices are going up and some of the company's content investments haven't gone as planned. Netflix said in October that its $10 per month high-definition plan would rise to $11. Meanwhile, \"Bright,\" which the company touted as its \"most ambitious film yet\" in October, was panned by popular review sites.\nAt the same time, the prospect of more competition looms on the horizon. It's been nearly 6 months since Disney said it planned to pull its movies from Netflix in favor of its own service. Since then, Disney also agreed to buy 21st Century Fox assets , a megadeal that would give the combined company a significant stake in Netflix's rival, Hulu.\nBut Netflix's chief content officer Ted Sarandos has said he doesn't want to get \" too distracted by the competitive landscape ,\" and analysts admit the company has some advantages, noting the popularity of shows like \"The Crown\" and \"Stranger Things.\"\nNetflix shares are up over 60 percent over the past year.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-22T22:15:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-22T22:20:05.049+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
