I count my millions,” said the former Wimbledon quarter-finalist, who reached the third round at Melbourne Park last year. \n“You go do what I did (on court). Bye bye.” \nThe setback follows on from Tomic’s forgettable 2017 season, during which he declared himself “bored” by tennis at Wimbledon and spoke of feeling “trapped” during media interviews. \nOnce touted as a future top-10 player and potential grand slam winner, Tomic’s slide has triggered both concern and criticism in Australia. \nTennis Australia said it had reached out to Tomic out of fear for his “health and wellbeing” in November but declined to offer him a wildcard for the grand slam. \nThe player was lambasted by home media last year for bragging in a TV interview about his wealth and prize money despite not trying very hard through his career.
