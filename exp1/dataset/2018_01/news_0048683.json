On a third occasion, a highly profitable trade was picked up but not investigated and escalated properly, the FCA said. \n“Firms not only have a key responsibility to report suspicious conduct in our capital markets, they also have an obligation to ensure their trading systems are not used for the purpose of financial crime,” said Mark Steward, the FCA’s head of enforcement and market oversight. \n“IBUK’s systems were inadequate and ineffective in the face of potentially suspicious transactions; they fell below the appropriate standards and exposed counterparties and the market to risks they did not bargain for,” he added. \nUnder anti-market abuse rules, financial companies have to report suspected market abuse to the FCA with so-called Suspicious Trading Reports (STRs). \nInteractive Brokers was not immediately available for comment.
