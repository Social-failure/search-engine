In other recent years its rankings were to 41 in 2015, 48 in 2016 and 57 in 2017, the World Bank’s reports show.\nRomer told the newspaper that the decline resulted from methodological changes, rather than a deterioration of Chile’s business environment, and may have been the result of the World Bank staff’s political motivations. He told the newspaper he would revise the reports.\nReporting by David Lawder and Lesley Wroughton; Editing by Leslie Adler\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-01-25T07:25:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-25T02:04:41.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
