Vale is prioritizing cutting debt and increasing returns for shareholders before any new investments, he added. \nThe world’s top nickel producer has no plans to boost production of the metal, as it awaits stronger demand from the electric car industry, he said. \nFigueiredo added that Vale had no plans to sell nickel-producing assets now, as the company expected a recovery in the metal’s price.
