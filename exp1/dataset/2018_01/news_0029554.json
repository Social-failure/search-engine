Shoreline has a 45 percent interest in the field.\nShoreline chairman Kola Karim said the “transformational” deal would enable the company to step up gross production to as much as 100,000 bpd over the next year.\nVitol declined to comment on the deal.\nThe financing was arranged with support from Vitol, as well as Ecobank, Fidelity Bank, Union Bank, FCMB and Farallon Capital Management.\nNigeria’s state oil company NNPC is also looking to arrange prepayment deals worth $3.5-$5 billion with commodity traders to fund upstream oil and projects, and has also said it will look to the private sector to revamp its ailing refineries and oil infrastructure.
