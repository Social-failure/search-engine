It is the third-largest digital currency in the world.\nSeagate's investment in Ripple has been widely covered in previous years. It is listed as one of Ripple's investors on the company's website.\nThe size of that investment could not be verified by CNBC. Seagate and Ripple did not respond to requests for comment.\n— CNBC's Michael Bloom contributed to this story. \nDisclaimer", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-08T20:53:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-08T20:54:17.025+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
