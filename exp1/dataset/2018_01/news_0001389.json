Wednesday gain brought it back to November levels before a third-quarter sales miss. \n“The Next share price rollercoaster continues,” said Mike van Dulken, head of research at Accendo Markets. \n“Management’s update-by-update tinkering of guidance and sharp share price reactions only goes to reinforce how shareholders remain at the mercy of the UK consumer from one season to the next and exposed to short-termism.” \nThe main non-food retailers drove the market, with Marks & Spencer up 2 percent while Primark owner ABF gained 2.6 percent. \nMid and small-caps also jumped on the retail rally and the more domestically-focused indexes rose 0.2 percent each. \nFashion retailer N Brown rose 7 percent to the top of the FTSE 250, and shares in small-cap department store Debenhams rose 3.8 percent. \nOil majors Royal Dutch Shell and BP, still feeling the glow from a remarkably strong start to the year for crude prices, also delivered a boost. \nBut the FTSE 100 stayed negative as the weightier financials and consumer staples sectors wilted. \nHeavyweights Diageo, Imperial Brands and British American Tobacco fell 0.5 to 1 percent. The highly U.S.-exposed firms were dented by the decline in the dollar which sank to a near four-month low. \nFinancials were led lower by HSBC and Standard Chartered, the most internationally-exposed of the UK-listed banks which also suffer from a weaker dollar. \nEU regulatory reforms under the MiFID II market directive that came into force on Wednesday had little early impact on the market, traders said. \nSome suggested the wide-ranging new rules could distract investors from their trading desks as they adjusted to the change.
