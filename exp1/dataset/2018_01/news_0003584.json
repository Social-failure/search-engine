The intensive use of computers for bitcoin mining has boosted demand for electricity. \nIn September China ordered all initial coin offerings to cease and all cryptocurrency trading exchanges to be shuttered with the aim of containing financial risks. Bitcoin miners have feared that they could be the next target. \nAt the meeting, the PBOC said development of bitcoin mining will be limited, according to the source, who declined to be named as he is not authorized to speak on the matter. \nThe PBOC could not be reached for immediate comment outside business hours.
