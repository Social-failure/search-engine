Graham, who finished with 15 points, eight rebounds and seven assists, made both free throws for the final margin.\nThe Bears did not get off a shot attempt in the closing seconds. They were led by senior center Jo Lual-Acuil Jr., who recorded a double-double with 14 points and 12 rebounds. Senior forward Nuni Omot also scored 14 points.\nFrom the 7:34 mark in the first half to the 5:22 mark of the second, the Jayhawks did not get a field goal from anyone other than sophomore center Udoka Azubuike, who scored his team’s first 11 points of the second half. Azubuike finished with 14 points and seven rebounds, while Newman also led Kansas on the glass with eight boards.\nThe Jayhawks have used an average margin of four points to record their six conference victories.\nKansas jumped to a 13-point lead at the first media timeout, while Baylor did not grab a rebound until more than five minutes had elapsed.\nThe Bears managed to make a few slight runs but trailed 38-27 at halftime after shooting 30 percent. Newman’s 12 points led the Jayhawks’ first-half charge.\nEarlier on Saturday, Kansas announced that freshman forward Billy Preston would discontinue his bid to gain eligibility to play professionally for a team based in Bosnia. Preston had not played yet for the Jayhawks after compliance officials began taking a look into the financing of a vehicle he drove.\n“Although he has been frustrated with the situation,” said Kansas coach Bill Self, “Billy’s attitude has been tremendous and he has developed as a person and as a player. I‘m sure that will continue as he prepares for his professional career.”\n--Field Level Media\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-01-21T09:45:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-21T13:21:00.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
