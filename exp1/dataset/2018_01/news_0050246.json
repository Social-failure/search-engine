Included in the measures announced on Monday, family members of ministers were banned from holding government jobs. \nMacri scored a series of business-friendly legislative wins late last year after his coalition swept mid-term elections. But passage of his pension reform bill last month triggered violent protests and a decline in the president’s approval ratings. \nPressured by the country’s powerful labour unions, the government cancelled a special session of Congress planned for February to debate Macri’s proposed labour reform. \nThe bill includes amnesty for companies that register workers who had been paid off the books. It aims to curb litigation by workers and would lighten social security taxes paid by employers. The private sector has long argued for more flexibility in labour regulations.
