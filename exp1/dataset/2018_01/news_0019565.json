Foreign ministers have not been involved in negotiations directly.\nUnder a 1995 accord, Greece agreed to allow the country to be referred to internationally only as “the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia” until the dispute is resolved.\nThat is the formal name under which Macedonia was admitted to the United Nations in 1993, and still the name NATO, the EU and other bodies use for it, even though it broke away in 1991 from Yugoslavia, a country that no longer exists.\n“We have a huge responsibility,” Dimitrov said adding that Macedonia is aware of concerns its neighbours may have.\n“It is clear that the identity is very important for us. We have to find a way to convince our Greek colleagues that there is a clear distinction between our country and a region which includes northern Greece,” he said\nDimitrov said that Macedonia, which was granted European Union candidacy status in 2005, hopes to set a date to start membership talks in June. It is also seeking an invitation to join NATO, which already includes most of its neighbors.\n“I am a cautious optimist,” Dimitrov said referring to the resolution of the name dispute.\nGreek government officials have suggested Greece would try to focus on brokering an agreement which calls for a compound name with a geographical qualifier.\nMacedonia avoided the violence that accompanied the breakup of Yugoslavia, but was later rocked by an ethnic Albanian insurgency that almost tore the country apart in 2001.\nThe country’s ethnic Macedonian majority speaks a Slavic language closely related to Bulgarian, while a large Albanian minority accounts for a third of the population.\nMacedonia is also the name of the largest and second most-populous province in Greece, and of the ancient northern Greek kingdom ruled by Alexander the Great.\nReporting by Ivana Sekularac; Editing by Peter Graff\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-01-12T23:34:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-12T18:16:17.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
