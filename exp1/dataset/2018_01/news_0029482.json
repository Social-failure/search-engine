REUTERS/Daniel Becerril Several former PRI state governors are in custody facing charges ranging from embezzlement to drug trafficking and earlier on Friday the attorney general’s office said it had issued extradition requests for another PRI ex-governor.\nIn 2014, President Enrique Pena Nieto, his wife and a top aide all faced allegations of conflicts of interest over properties they acquired from government contractors, though a government-led probe exonerated them of wrongdoing.\nJose Antonio Meade, presidential pre-candidate for the Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI), talks to his wife Juana Cuevas during a political event in Mexico City, Mexico January 14, 2018.

An opinion poll this week showed Meade losing ground to Lopez Obrador.\nMeade delivered his remarks in the state of Quintana Roo, which was governed until 2016 by the PRI’s Roberto Borge. Earlier this month, Borge was extradited from Panama to Mexico to face corruption charges. Borge denies the charges.\nReporting by Gabriel Stargardter; Editing by Dave Graham and Rosalba O'Brien\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-20T02:17:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-20T02:32:01.008+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
