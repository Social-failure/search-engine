Images of Nicanor Parra, the Chilean artist and writer who described himself as an \"antipoet,\" are seen during the celebration of his 100th birthday outside his house in Las Cruces coastal town, Chile September 5, 2014. REUTERS/Ivan Alvarado \nHis sister Violeta Parra was a well-known folk singer, as is her son, Angel. His daughter Colombina and grandson, also called Angel, both had some success with rock bands in Latin America in the 1990s. \nNicanor Parra’s first published book of poems was “Cancionero Sin Nombre” (Songbook Without a Name), released in 1937 while he was a student in the capital Santiago. In it, Parra broke with the florid style prevalent in Latin American literature at the time, and adopted a more direct, colloquial style.
