REUTERS/Lee Jae-Won/Files Exports for the year as a whole jumped $573.9 billion or 15.8 percent, data showed on Monday, making last year the best since relevant data began to be compiled in 1956.\nThe government is expecting still-solid but more modest export growth of 4 percent this year. With the economy riding the global trade boom, South Korea’s central bank raised interest rates for the first time in more than six years in November.\n“Downside risks for South Korea are the won’s strength, rising interest rates and oil prices. They are the new three risks,” trade minister Paik Un-gyu said in a statement.\nA further wild cards will be trade talks with the United States, which is keen to revise a 2012 deal to reduce its trade deficit with South Korea. Talks will begin on Jan. 5.\nDecember’s 8.9 percent expansion slightly underperformed the 10.3 percent growth forecast by economists in a Reuters poll and eased from 9.5 percent in November.\nShipping containers are seen at the Hanjin Shipping container terminal at Incheon New Port in Incheon, South Korea, September 7, 2016.
