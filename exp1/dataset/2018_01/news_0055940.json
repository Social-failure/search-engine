Excluding a one-time tax adjustment related to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 and provision expense related to one large commercial credit, net income was $8.6 million or $0.42 per diluted share. This represents the Corporation’s 70 th consecutive quarterly profit over its 72 quarter history. Consistent with management’s renewed objective of a 40% dividend payout of sustainable core earnings, the Board of Directors declared a dividend of $0.15 per share for common shareholders of record as of February 12, 2018 and payable on February 23, 2018.\nHighlights\nReported fourth quarter earnings of $3.0 million or $0.15 per diluted share. Excluding $3.1 million in pre-tax ($2.1 million after tax) provision expense related to one large commercial credit and $3.5 million in tax expense related to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (“Act”), earnings were $8.6 million after tax or $0.42 per diluted share; Tangible book value 1 per common share was $11.52 at December 31, 2017, a decrease of $0.12 from the prior period. Excluding the $3.5 million tax expense related to the Act, tangible book value per common share was $11.69; Loans held for investment were $1.98 billion at December 31, 2017 compared to $1.05 billion at December 31, 2016, a year-over-year growth of 88.5%. Organic loan growth from the linked quarter was $34.8 million prior to the strategic sale of $17.2 million of non-core residential real estate loans and the disposition of a deteriorating commercial loan of $8.5 million; and Non-interest bearing demand deposits of $745.0 million were 33.3% of total deposits at December 31, 2017 compared to $362.0 million at December 31, 2016, a year-over-year growth of 105.8%.\nThe transformative combination of Access National with Middleburg Financial continues on a successful progression. “We continue to work on putting acquisition distractions behind us and believe the stage is set for a promising 2018. In spite of the noise this quarter with the tax adjustment and loan portfolio repositioning, we remain on target with the financial objectives of our merger. Furthermore, we continue to implement a program of enhanced focus on our target markets that is producing results in the most desirable segments of the deposit and loan portfolios. We are confident in our ability to meet our renewed growth targets in 2018 of $200 million per annum in net deposit and loan growth.”\nFourth quarter 2017 pre-tax earnings were $9.0 million, down from the $9.4 million reported in the third quarter of 2017 due mainly to an impaired credit loss of $3.1 million pre-tax. The commercial banking segment’s net interest income declined $636 thousand from the linked quarter, from $24.4 million to $23.7 million. The commercial banking segment’s other expense reflected an increase of $101 thousand when compared to the third quarter of 2017 and included a $3.1 million pre-tax provision expense.\nThe net interest margin on a fully tax equivalent (non-GAAP) basis decreased to 3.83% from 3.86% when comparing fourth quarter to third quarter 2017. Fourth quarter net interest margin exclusive of the $1.2 million credit mark accretion for the acquired loan portfolio and the $3 thousand in liability discount amortization was 3.77% for the three months ended December 31, 2017.\nTotal deposits at December 31, 2017 were $2.2 billion, down slightly from the $2.3 billion at September 30, 2017 while non-interest bearing deposits increased $34.3 million from the linked quarter, to $745.0 million. While non-interest bearing demand deposits remain the largest and most attractive source of funding for the Corporation, the combination of legacy Middleburg’s significant low cost interest-bearing demand deposits and legacy Access’ non-interest bearing demand deposits accounted for $1.2 billion or 55.6% of total deposits at December 31, 2017. Interest-bearing deposits decreased to $1.5 billion at December 31, 2017 when compared to $1.6 billion from the prior quarter. Brokered deposits as a percentage of the deposit portfolio decreased quarter over quarter, from 3.1% of the portfolio at September 30, 2017 to 2.3% at December 31, 2017, a decrease of $20.1 million. The go-forward strategy places a high priority on the maintenance and expansion of core deposits, particularly high value demand deposit relationships.\nPrior to the strategic sale and disposition of $25.7 million in loans, organic loan growth during the fourth quarter was $34.8 million. Organic loan growth net of run-off totaled $116 million for the three quarters since the acquisition of Middleburg Financial Corporation. Acquired non-core residential real estate loans in the amount $17.2 million were sold to mitigate interest rate risk and provide portfolio capacity for relationship focused credits. A gain on the sale of this portfolio was recognized in the amount of $136 thousand pre-tax as well as the recognition of $481 thousand in pre-tax credit and fair value marks. Separately, a deteriorating commercial loan relationship in the amount $8.5 million was sold for $4.9 million, creating a loss of $3.6 million charged to the reserve. This charge accounted for the majority of the $3.7 million provision expense during the quarter. In careful analysis in reaching the decision to exit this relationship, management concluded the credit was destined to become a non-accrual loan in the very near term and generate losses over a prolonged work out or liquidation at a level well beyond the incurred charge.\nNon-performing assets (“NPAs”) decreased to $5.3 million at December 31, 2017 from $7.8 million at September 30, 2017, representing 0.18% and 0.27% of total assets, respectively. Included in the NPAs total is $643 thousand in other real estate owned, a reduction of $1.4 million over the prior quarter. The allowance for loan loss was $15.8 million and $15.7 million at December 31, 2017 and September 30, 2017, respectively, and represented 0.80% of total loans held for investment at December 31, 2017 and September 30, 2017. The remaining credit and fair value marks on the loans acquired in the merger totaled $12.4 million at December 31, 2017.\nTangible book value 2 per common share decreased from $11.64 at September 30, 2017 to $11.52 at December 31, 2017. The tangible common equity ratio for Access National Corporation and its subsidiary bank was 8.79% at December 31, 2017, within the Corporation’s target range of 8.50% to 9.50%.\nAccess National Corporation is the parent company of Access National Bank and Middleburg Investment Group serving Northern and Central Virginia.

These non-GAAP financial measures are “tangible book value per common shares”, “tangible common equity ratio”, and “net interest margin on a fully tax equivalent basis.” This non-GAAP disclosure has limitations as an analytical tool and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of the Corporation’s results as reported under GAAP, nor is it necessarily comparable to non-GAAP per performance measures that may be presented by other companies. Out management uses these non-GAAP measures in its analysis of our performance because it believes these measures are material and will be used as a measure of our performance by investors.\nThree Months Three Months Three Months Three Months Twelve Months Twelve Months Ended Ended Ended Ended Ended Ended December 31, September 30, June 30, March 31, December 31, December 31, (Dollars In Thousands) 2017 2017 2017 2017 2017 2016 Book value per common share $ 20.53 $ 20.55 $ 20.36 $ 11.40 $ 20.53 $ 11.33 Effect of intangible assets $ (9.01 ) $ (8.91 ) $ (9.04 ) $ (0.17 ) $ (9.01 ) $ (0.17 ) Tangible book value per common share $ 11.52 $ 11.64 $ 11.32 $ 11.23 $ 11.52 $ 11.16 Common equity ratio 14.67 % 14.62 % 15.05 % 8.77 % 14.67 % 8.42 % Effect of intangible assets -5.88 % -5.77 % -6.08 % -0.12 % -5.88 % -0.11 % Tangible common equity ratio 8.79 % 8.85 % 8.97 % 8.65 % 8.79 % 8.31 % Net interest margin 3.77 % 3.76 % 3.91 % 3.46 % 3.81 % 3.52 % Effect of tax exempt securities and loans 0.06 % 0.10 % 0.06 % 0.06 % 0.07 % 0.03 % Net interest margin - fully tax equivalent basis 3.83 % 3.86 % 3.97 % 3.52 % 3.88 % 3.55 % Return on average equity 3.09 % 6.69 % 3.73 % 8.57 % 5.03 % 14.11 % Effect of intangible assets 1.97 % 5.20 % 3.00 % 0.13 % 2.69 % 0.22 % Return on average tangible equity 5.06 % 11.89 % 6.73 % 8.70 % 7.72 % 14.33 % Average equity $ 394,319 $ 418,678 $ 412,146 $ 121,724 $ 327,738 $ 116,296 Effect of average intangible assets $ 153,565 $ 183,152 $ 183,666 $ 1,828 $ 125,330 $ 1,859 Average tangible equity $ 240,754 $ 235,526 $ 228,480 $ 119,896 $ 202,408 $ 114,437\nView source version on businesswire.com : http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180130006502/en/\nAccess National Corporation\nMichael Clarke, 703-871-2100\nSource: Access National Corporation", "external_links": ["http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180130006502/en/", "http://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.AccessNationalBank.com&esheet=51751222&newsitemid=20180130006502&lan=en-US&anchor=www.AccessNationalBank.com&index=1&md5=24aafa7c4943fcf5d7b2a72db3a36e7f"], "published": "2018-01-31T02:35:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-31T02:07:28.001+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
