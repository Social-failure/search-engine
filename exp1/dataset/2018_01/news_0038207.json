In the last 24 hours, we have had a total of 32 cases,” Chilufya said. \nZambia on Jan. 14 relaxed rules, including the closure of markets and schools, imposed to curb the spread of cholera as the number of new cases being reported halved. \nCholera is a bacterial disease transmitted through food and water that causes severe diarrhea that can lead to sometimes deadly dehydration. \nChilufya said the measures put in place to contain the outbreak were clearly working. \nPresident Edgar Lungu last month directed the military to clean markets and unblock drains to help to fight the spread of the disease. \n“The civil-military operation that has been going on has paid dividends,” Chilufya said, referring to the presidential order for the military to join the clean up exercise. \nChilufya said by Jan. 20, the government had vaccinated 1.3 million people, including inmates in congested prisons, against cholera.
