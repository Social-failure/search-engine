Even those saving their earnings to send home contribute indirectly, via the bank system, to investment in their host countries.\nAs entrepreneurs and investors, immigrants also create jobs and promote innovation and technological change.\n“Through these different roles, immigrants can help stimulate economic growth ... and thus promote development,” the report said.\nIt recommended developing countries foster policies and legal routes aimed at “making the most of immigration”.\nImmigrants in formal employment pay tax, it noted, also urging an end to any barriers that stop migrants creating businesses or investing.\nThe authors cited Rwanda as an example of a country that has made immigration part of its economic development strategy.\nThose countries that lack integration policies run risks.\n“(This) can generate serious problems of social cohesion which in some cases even translates into riots and turmoil,” the analysts said, citing a 2010-2011 conflict in Ivory Coast.\nPositive initiatives highlighted included a Thai health insurance scheme, language classes in Argentina and one-stop shops in Ghana aimed at helping immigrants set up businesses.\nEditing by Lyndsay Griffiths.
