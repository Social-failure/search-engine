The company’s current market capitalization is about 7.2 billion pounds.\nSpokesmen for Whitbread and Sachem Head declined to comment.\nThe hedge fund is reviving an idea long mooted by investors and analysts that Whitbread should spin off its popular Costa chain.\nFounded 276 years ago as a brewery by Samuel Whitbread and Godfrey and Thomas Shewell, Whitbread is one of Britain’s oldest companies that grew into a sprawling business with a pub estate and restaurants, as well as its Costa chain and beer operations.\nIt has become more streamlined in the past few years, however, selling off its brewing business and some pubs to focus mainly on Premier Inn, Costa, the Beefeater restaurant brand and the Brewers Fayre pub restaurant chain.\nActivist investors often buy stakes in companies to push them to consider break-ups or asset sales to increase value for investors.\nRBR Capital Advisors last year called on Swiss bank Credit Suisse to spin off its asset management operations and investment bank. Mining group BHP Billiton ( BHP.AX ) ( BLT.L ) is exiting its U.S. shale oil and gas unit following calls from hedge fund Elliott for an overhaul.\nSachem Head has around $4 billion in assets under management and was set up in 2013 by Scott Ferguson, who previously worked with billionaire activist Bill Ackman at his Pershing Square Capital Management hedge fund.\nUnlike more aggressive activists like Elliott, Sachem Head only occasionally pushes for change at the companies where it invests. One of its most notable activist campaigns to date has been at U.S. design software maker Autodesk, where Ferguson had a board seat until last year.\nAnalysts at Barclays said in a note dated Jan. 3 that the “most ‘obvious’ step” for Whitbread would be to sell Costa, should its boss Brittain, who took the helm in December 2015, decide to restructure the company. Whitbread said last October that it had more than 2,300 Costa stores in the UK, and it also has almost 7,000 Costa Express machines.\nSachem Head’s investment comes at a difficult time for Whitbread.\nShares in the business, which is due to issue a quarterly trading update on Thursday, have fallen 8 percent since the Brexit vote in June 2016, amid worries Britain’s impending exit will dent consumer confidence.\nOn Oct. 24, Whitbread posted a sharp slowdown in revenue growth at Premier Inn, disappointing expectations that it might have benefited from sterling’s weakness following the Brexit vote.\nInvestors had hoped that the fall in the pound would have encouraged more Britons to take domestic holidays and foreign tourists to visit the UK, where Premier Inn had about more than 70,100 rooms last year.\nHowever, Whitbread reported a 1.8 percent increase in UK revenue per available room in the six months to the end of August 2017, which was lower than investors had expected. Costa’s UK revenue climbed 8.3 percent to 542 million pounds in the same period.\nWhitbread shares closed down 2.3 percent.\nReporting by Ben Martin.
