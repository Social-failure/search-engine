He did not give details of the proposals.\nPresident Jacob Zuma’s reign has been beset by allegations of influence-peddling in government and mismanagement of state-owned enterprises which have dented consumer and business confidence. Zuma has denied allegations that he has allowed his friends to influence the appointment of ministers.\nSouth Africa’s economy grew 2.5 percent in the three months to the end of June, after contracting by 0.6 percent in the first quarter and by 0.3 percent in the final quarter of 2016.\nFILE PHOTO: South Africa's Finance Minister Malusi Gigaba poses for a photograph after speaking at the Thomson Reuters economist of the year awards at the Johannesburg Stock Exchange (JSE) offices in Sandton, South Africa, July 13, 2017. REUTERS/Siphiwe Sibeko/File Photo But since South Africa emerged from its 2009 recession, growth has fallen short of the government’s target of five percent, the level economists say is needed to curb unemployment.\nRATING A Moody’s rating review could see South Africa’s rating cut to junk and the country’s bonds ejected from a key index. That could in turn cause capital to flee the country, raising bond yields and pressuring the currency.\n“We are certainly going to avoid it. I‘m very confident,” Gigaba said when asked about the possibility of a downgrade.\nHe said ratings agencies had previously expressed concern over political and policy certainty, as well as the government’s commitment to fighting corruption.\nGigaba said these issues had largely been resolved after Cyril Ramaphosa won the race in December to be the new leader of the ruling African National Congress (ANC).\nEarlier this month the new ANC leader said South Africa wanted to attract foreign investors to help it kick-start economic growth and will crack down on corruption.\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-01-25T00:29:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-24T21:25:40.014+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
