It is now due for approval by EU ministers on Jan. 29.\n“How fast can a deal be sealed? Depends exclusively on progress made in negotiations on legal text in Brussels,” Germany’s Brexit coordinator, Peter Ptassek, said of talks due to start in February in Brussels between Britain and the EU negotiator Michel Barnier.\nThe 27 other EU states indeed want Britain to remain bound by the bloc’s laws and regulations in exchange for access to the internal market. Britain, however, would no longer have a vote in EU institutions.\nBritain’s prime minister, Theresa May, has struggled to keep the warring factions of her party, including her top ministers, united as she negotiates the end of more than 40 years of union with the bloc.\nThose divisions were aired in public on Tuesday, when foreign minister Boris Johnson demanded the government pay 100 million pounds a week more to the public health service to show the voting public what the benefits of Brexit could be.\nInstead, he was slapped down by May, but won support in a Conservative Party which is losing members at a time when opposition Labour is enjoying record support.\nRelated Coverage Don't worry, you won't be deported: UK minister tells EU citizens UK will be subject to ECJ rulings under Brexit transition deal: minister For Brexit supporters such as Rees-Mogg, the continued jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice after Brexit day on March 29, 2019, is a betrayal of a campaign promise to voters to “take back control”.\nBut Davis said they would only have to swallow such close relations for a little while longer and should instead focus on what ties Britain would have with the EU in the future.\n“I am relaxed about transition because my primary concern is about the future relationship,” he said. “That’s what matters, that’s what people will think about and judge us on in 10, 20 30 years’ time.”\nReporting by Elizabeth Piper and William James, Additional reporting by Gabriela Baczynska, Editing by Alistair Smout and Alison Williams\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-01-24T18:14:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-24T15:11:54.005+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
