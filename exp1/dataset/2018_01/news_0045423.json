They also said there were three to four interested bidders.\nAt 6.25 times, the staple financing is competitive, several sources said.\nIt follows a 7.0 times staple being offered by JP Morgan and Morgan Stanley to back a potential sale of French drug maker Sanofi’s European generic drug business, known as Zentiva.\nStaple financings give potential buyers comfort they can finance a bid, they have however been traditionally seen as something to beat by other non-staple banks.\n“Staples are usually seen as a first stab and open to competition for more aggression from other banks,” a syndicate head said.\nHowever, at 6.25 times and 7.0 times, the staples being offered on Akzo’s and Sanofi’s divisions are highly viable financing options, the sources said.\nChemicals account for a third of Akzo’s sales and earnings and its value is estimated at roughly €9bn.
