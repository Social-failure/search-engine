The boycott has blocked U.S. companies like Exxon Mobil from investing in such projects.\nKremlin-controlled giant Rosneft said in December it had started exploration drilling for oil and gas at a Black Sea offshore deposit.\nEni has three licenses with Rosneft in the Black Sea and Barents Sea.\nIn her earlier comments, Marcegaglia said her company’s main concern was that it understood and complied with the U.S. sanctions because it has shares listed on U.S. exchanges.\n“We will try to understand a little bit better what we should do ... We have to be absolutely compliant with the U.S. authority because we are also listed in the U.S.,” she told a session attended by Russian officials and business people.\nRosneft said the drilling at the Black Sea offshore project was continuing.\nRelated Coverage Drilling at Rosneft-led offshore project continues as planned: ENI chairwoman “There are no reasons to stop the work at the well,” said Rosneft spokesman Mikhail Leontyev.\nAsked whether drilling on the project was still under way, Leontyev said: “Of course.”\nAccording to shipping data on the Thomson Reuters terminal, the drilling vessel Scarabeo 9, owned by Italian oil service group Saipem and used for the Rosneft offshore project, is currently in the Black sea not far from the oil deposit.\nReporting by Paola Arosio, Denis Pinchuk and Vladimir Soldatkin; Additional reporting by Oksana Kobzeva; Writing by Gabrielle Tétrault-Farber and Denis Pinchuk; Editing by David Evans and Hugh Lawson\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-01-24T23:10:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-25T12:57:14.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
