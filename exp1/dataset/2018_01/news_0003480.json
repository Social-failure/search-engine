There are signs that show France is less depressed.”\nFor the first time in five years, a majority of 51 percent of the French said the past year was a positive one.\nThat was in contrast with the 54 percent who thought 2015 and 2016 were negative - years that were marked by deadly Islamist militant attacks. The state of emergency instituted by Hollande over those attacks was lifted by Macron in November.\nReporting by Michel Rose; editing by Mark Heinrich\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-02T16:39:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-02T16:56:10.019+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
