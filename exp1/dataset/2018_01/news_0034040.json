The Japanese carmaker’s Infiniti brand recalled 17,500 affected vehicles. \nThe issue is unrelated to a global recall of faulty Takata ( TKTDQ.PK ) airbag inflators that have been blamed for 20 deaths. \nInadequate grounding in the Daimler units leaves their circuitry vulnerable to electrostatic charges that can trigger unintended airbag deployments, according to earlier warnings. \nMercedes reported “a handful of instances where drivers suffered minor abrasions or bruises” as a result of the problem. No Aston Martin customers have reported any such incidents to date, the company said, adding the necessary repair work would be carried out free of charge in less than two hours.
