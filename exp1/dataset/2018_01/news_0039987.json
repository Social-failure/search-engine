To achieve the government target of 300,000 new homes per year, the cap should be abolished. The potential of local authorities to build should be unleashed.” \nThe committee also noted that the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) had said abolishing property purchase tax on the first 300,000 pounds of any property costing up to 500,000 pounds for first-time buyers would result in only 3,500 additional people being able to buy their first home. \n“In isolation, the reduction in stamp duty is likely to increase prices for first-time buyers by as much, if not more, than the amount they save as a reduction in stamp duty,” it said. \nThe committee also said the government needed to agree transitional arrangements with the European Union for a period after Britain leaves the EU to encourage private investment and help improve Britain’s persistently low productivity. \n“The government’s commitment to increase public investment is welcome, but a revival in productivity also requires action from the private sector,” Morgan said. \n“The OBR expects a fall in private sector investment due to Brexit-related uncertainty. An agreement between the UK and the EU27 (remaining members of the EU) on a ‘standstill’ transitional arrangements is therefore urgent.” Reporting by Paul Sandle; Editing by Adrian Croft", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-22T02:14:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-22T02:26:12.001+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
