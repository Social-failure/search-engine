(Nasdaq: EXAS) today announced that the company expects to report revenue between $86.9 million and $87.9 million for the fourth quarter ended Dec. 31, 2017, an increase of 148 percent from the same quarter of 2016. The company completed approximately 176,000 Cologuard tests during the fourth quarter of 2017, 115-percent growth from the same period of 2016.\nFor the full-year 2017, the company anticipates reporting revenue between $265.5 million and $266.5 million, a year-over-year increase of 168 percent. Completed Cologuard test volume during 2017 was approximately 571,000 tests, a 134-percent increase from 2016.\nNearly 11,000 health care providers ordered Cologuard for the first time during the fourth quarter ended Dec. 31, 2017. The number of providers who have ordered Cologuard since its launch increased to nearly 102,000 during 2017.\n\"An increasing number of people are being screened for colon cancer with our accurate, non-invasive test,\" said Kevin Conroy, chairman and CEO of Exact Sciences. \"As demand for Cologuard strengthens, we will continue to invest in our team, facilities and infrastructure to support the company's long-term growth.\"\nExact Sciences has not completed preparation of its financial statements for the fourth quarter or full year of 2017. The revenue ranges presented for Q4 2017 and for the year ended December 31, 2017 are preliminary and unaudited and are thus inherently uncertain and subject to change as we complete our financial results for Q4 2017. We are in the process of completing our customary year-end close and review procedures as of and for the year ended December 31, 2017, and there can be no assurance that our final results for this period will not differ from these estimates. During the course of the preparation of our consolidated financial statements and related notes as of and for the year ended December 31, 2017, we or our independent registered public accountants may identify items that could cause our final reported results to be materially different from the preliminary financial estimates presented herein.\nExact Sciences plans to report 2017 financial results and provide revenue and Cologuard test volume guidance on its February 2018 earnings call.\nAbout Cologuard\nCologuard was approved by the FDA in August 2014 and results from Exact Sciences' prospective 90-site, point-in-time, 10,000-patient pivotal trial were published in the New England Journal of Medicine in March 2014. Cologuard is included in the American Cancer Society's (2014) colorectal cancer screening guidelines and the recommendations of the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (2016) and National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2016). Cologuard is indicated to screen adults of either sex, 50 years or older, who are at average risk for colorectal cancer. Cologuard is not for everyone and is not a replacement for diagnostic colonoscopy or surveillance colonoscopy in high-risk individuals. False positives and false negatives do occur. Any positive test result should be followed by a diagnostic colonoscopy. Following a negative result, patients should continue participating in a screening program at an interval and with a method appropriate for the individual patient. Cologuard performance when used for repeat testing has not been evaluated or established. For more information about Cologuard, visit www.cologuardtest.com .
