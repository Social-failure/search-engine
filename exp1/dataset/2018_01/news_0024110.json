The rial traded for 440 to the dollar by year’s end and this week crashed to around 500.\nA large deposit from Saudi Arabia would give the authorities the financial means to stabilize the currency and make it possible for people to buy food, the government says.\n“First and foremost is saving the Yemeni riyal from total collapse, now and tomorrow. Saving the riyal means saving Yemenis from inevitable hunger,” Prime Minister Ahmed Obeid bin Daghr said on Twitter.\nState news agency Saba Quote: d government spokesman Rajeh Badi as saying on Monday that the authorities were “intensifying communication” with the Saudis, to “expedite the completion of the Saudi depository procedures”.\nSaudi officials did not immediately respond to a request for comment about the funds.\nPresident Abd Rabbu Mansour Hadi announced on Nov. 11 that Riyadh had agreed to deposit $2 billion into Yemen’s central bank to shore up the rial and secure shipments of badly needed fuel.\nHadi’s government officially moved the central bank in 2016 from Sanaa to Hadi’s base in the southern port city of Aden. A separate branch still operates in Sanaa under the Houthis.\nBoth branches suffer from depleted reserves, but they have played a role in mitigating economic pain by paying some public sector salaries, as soaring prices threaten to push basic commodities out of reach for many Yemenis.\nThe Aden authorities accuse the Houthis of plundering the bank’s foreign reserves in Sanaa to fund their war effort, charges the Houthis and the Sanaa bank deny.\nReporting By Mohammed Ghobari and Noah Browning; Editing by Larry King and Peter Graff\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-16T12:47:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-16T13:08:52.010+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
