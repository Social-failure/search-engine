There has been unacceptable behavior which should be punished,” Le Maire told a news conference.\nLe Maire said he would meet French supermarket operators later on Thursday and meet Lactalis management on Friday to discuss the matter.\nReporting by Yann Le Guernigou, Dominique Vidalon and Sudip Kar-Gupta; Editing by Richard Lough\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-01-11T20:05:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-11T17:00:57.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
