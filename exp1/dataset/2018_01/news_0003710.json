Bush, who once used that term to describe countries including Iran, Iraq and North Korea.\nMacron also said he would only visit Iran if there was a return to calm and respect for freedoms.\nReporting by Jean-Baptiste Vey; Writing by Ingrid Melander; Editing by Richard Balmforth\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-01-04T03:50:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-04T08:02:42.003+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
