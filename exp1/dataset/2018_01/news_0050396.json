Neftlix’s Chief Product Officer Gregory Peters said on the company’s post-earnings conference call last week that set-top box integration allows Netflix to reach potential customers who currently watch more traditional television. \nAt the same time, cable executives see tie-ups with Netflix as a way to help fight cord cutting, the dropping of pay TV service. In November, Comcast Corp, the biggest U.S. cable provider, embedded Netflix into its Xfinity X1 set-top box. Charter has also said it plans to integrate Netflix. \nNetflix shares were up 2.8 percent to $282.43 in early trading. Altice shares were down 1.1 percent to $22.25.
