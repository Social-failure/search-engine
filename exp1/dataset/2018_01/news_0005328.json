Some users protested at Twitter's San Francisco headquarters on Wednesday.\nTwitter responded in its blog post that even if it did block a world leader, doing so would not silence that leader.\nThe company said that it does review tweets by world leaders and enforces its rules accordingly, leaving open the possibility that it could take down some material posted by them.\n\"No one person's account drives Twitter's growth, or influences these decisions,\" the company added. \"We work hard to remain unbiased with the public interest in mind.\"\nThe White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Twitter's statement.\nSome Twitter users expressed support for the company's decision, while others complained of a double standard.\n\"If I tweeted half of what Trump has since he entered office, I'd be permanently banned from this platform,\" a Twitter user wrote from the account zmichaelranaii.\n(Reporting by David Ingram in San Francisco; Additional reporting by Steve Holland in Washington; Editing by Jonathan Oatis)", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-06T00:26:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-07T03:41:39.009+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
