Slideshow (3 Images) \nCiting unnamed police sources, multiple news organizations had reported last month that investigators were operating on the working theory that the deaths were a murder-suicide. \nGomes said those reports were wrong and that investigators initially reviewed three possibilities: double suicide, murder suicide and double homicide. \nSherman was 75 and his wife was 70. Their deaths stunned the worlds of Canadian business, politics and philanthropy, and drew public condolences from prominent figures including Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, who attended a memorial service on Dec. 21 that was broadcast on television. \nBarry Sherman founded Apotex Inc in 1974 and built it into a pharmaceutical giant before stepping down as chief executive in 2012. He and his wife were known for their donations to hospitals, universities and Jewish organizations. \nSeparately, Apotex said on Friday that its Chief Executive Jeremy Desai had resigned and would be replaced by his predecessor and company co-founder Jack Kay. \nApotex is in a legal dispute with Teva Pharmaceuticals Industries ( TEVA.TA ) ( TEVA.N ), the world’s biggest maker of generic drugs, over allegations that a former Teva executive shared trade secrets with Desai. \nAn Apotex representative said Desai’s departure was not related to Teva’s lawsuit against Apotex. \nReuters could not immediately reach Desai for comment.
