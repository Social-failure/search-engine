It probably reached 2 percent in 2017 for the first time since 2011. In 2018, we will probably do better than our forecast of 1.7 percent,” Le Maire said in a New Year’s speech to representatives of different economic sectors.\nLe Maire said he had signed documents on Monday officially setting up a new 10 billion euro ($12.3 billion) fund aimed at boosting future growth by financing innovation.\nHe said it would initially be composed of 1.6 billion euros in proceeds from the sale last year of Engie and Renault shares and would include 8.4 billion euros in EDF and Thales shares, which remain government property.\nThe fund, which is to be housed within the Bpifrance public investment bank, is expected to generate revenues of 200-300 million euros to be used to finance breakthrough technologies, the finance ministry said in a statement. The 10 billion euros in capital will itself not be invested in innovation projects.\nLe Maire said that eventually the fund would be made up entirely from the proceeds of state asset sales, though a new law was needed to be able privatize some companies.\nA ministry source said the change was required for Paris airport operator ADP ( ADP.PA ), state gaming monopoly la Francaise des Jeux and utility Engie ( ENGIE.PA ).\nReporting by Leigh Thomas, Myriam Rivet and Yann Le Guernigou, addiotnal reporting by Gwenaelle Barzic; Editing by Richard Balmforth\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-01-15T19:23:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-15T16:49:20.026+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
