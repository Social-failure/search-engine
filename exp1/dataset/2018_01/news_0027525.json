It’s a pity that tomorrow’s stage has been canceled because we needed every opportunity we could get our hands on to claw back time.”\nDakar Rally - 2018 Peru-Bolivia-Argentina Dakar rally - 40th Dakar Edition stage seven, La Paz to Uyuni - January 13, 2018.

But one hour... it’s going to be difficult.”\nIn the motorcycle category, French Yamaha rider Adrien van Beveren remained in the lead but with a reduced advantage after a stage won by compatriot Antoine Meo on a KTM.\nVan Beveren is now just 22 seconds clear of Argentina’s Kevin Benavides.\nThe rally proper will resume on Tuesday for a stage between Salta and Belen.\nThe Dakar ends in Cordoba, Argentina, on Jan 20.\nReporting by Alan Baldwin in London, editing by Clare Fallon\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-14T23:44:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-15T00:02:03.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
