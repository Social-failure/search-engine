In November ZANU-PF fired five top Mugabe allies from parliament, including Jonathan Moyo, a fiercely combative mouthpiece for a faction that backed Grace Mugabe’s rise.\nMany of Mugabe’s political allies were either arrested by the military in a series of spectacular raids in the early hours of Nov. 15 or fled to neighboring countries.\nIn private, Mnangagwa’s allies worry that some of Mugabe’s supporters could regroup and campaign against the new president in elections that will be held in four to five months.\nMoyo told Reuters last week that the international community must help remove the “military government” that has taken power or risk the country descending into chaos.\nReporting by MacDonald Dzirutwe; Editing by Ed Stoddard and Michael Perry\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-01-19T15:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-19T14:18:24.004+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
