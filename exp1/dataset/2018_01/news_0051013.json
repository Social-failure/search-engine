The pace was slightly faster than that at which China’s overall vehicle market grew last year.\nAccording to the China Association of Automobile Manufacturers, vehicle sales in China totaled 28.88 million vehicles last year, up 3 percent on year.\nReporting By Norihiko Shirouzu; Editing by Sherry Jacob-Phillips\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-30T09:24:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-30T09:34:52.027+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
