For the six months ended December 31, 2017, net income was $1.8 million, or $0.10 per basic and diluted share, compared to $3.1 million for the six months ended December 31, 2016. Results for the three and six months ended December 31, 2017 include a $1.8 million deferred tax re-measurement charge associated with federal tax law changes enacted during the current quarter.\nThe following nonrecurring items were recorded in the periods indicated:\nIn connection with the passing of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, the Company recorded a $1.8 million charge to tax expense, reflecting a write-down of our deferred tax assets resulting from a decrease in the corporate income tax rate from 34% to 21%. The amount recorded in the current quarter is an estimate which may be refined in future periods as the Company finalizes its analysis of the tax law changes. A $173,000 pre-tax gain on sale of securities recorded during the three months ended September 30, 2017 and six months ended December 31, 2017. A $1.6 million settlement on an acquired loan included in other noninterest income in the three and six months ended December 31, 2016. A $521,000 lease write-down expense in the three and six months ended December 31, 2016.\nOn a non-GAAP basis, which excludes the nonrecurring items discussed above, the Company recorded net income of $1.8 million and $3.4 million for the three and six months ended December 31, 2017, or $0.10 and $0.20 per diluted share, respectively. This compares to non-GAAP net income of $950,000 and $2.4 million for the three and six months ended December 31, 2016. Reconciliations of GAAP to non-GAAP measures begin on page 12.\nEffective April 20, 2017, PCSB Bank completed its mutual-to-stock conversion and the Company completed its related initial public offering. Accordingly, 2016 financial results are for the Bank only.\nPresident’s Comments\nCommenting on the Company's results, Joseph Roberto, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer of PCSB Financial Corporation said, “We are pleased with our core second quarter results. Loans and deposits have grown $28.5 million (3.5%) and $25.9 million (2.4%), respectively; net interest income increased 19.5% from last year and 3.1% from last quarter; and non-performing assets as a percent of total assets has decreased from 0.91% at June 30, 2017 to 0.57% at December 31, 2017. These results are consistent with our continued strategy to leverage the capital raised in our initial public offering in April 2017 in a safe and disciplined way.”\n“While the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act required the Company to record a write-down of our deferred tax assets, we expect to benefit from the lower tax rate going forward, allowing for increased investment in strategic opportunities to increase stockholder value.”\nIncome Statement Summary\nNet interest income increased $1.7 million, or 19.5%, to $10.2 million for the three months ended December 31, 2017, compared to the same period in 2016 and increased $310,000, or 3.1%, compared to the previous quarter. Net interest income increased as a result of an increase in the average balances of loans and investment securities outstanding, partially offset by an increase in the average balance of advances from Federal Home Loan Bank. The net interest margin was 3.00% for the three months ended December 31, 2017, increasing from 2.89% for both the three months ended December 31, 2016 and September 30, 2017.\nThe provision for loan losses decreased $362,000 to $200,000 for the three months ended December 31, 2017 compared to the same period in 2016 due to increases in specific reserves on impaired loans in the prior year period. The provision for loan losses increased $65,000 compared to the prior quarter due primarily to increases in specific reserves on impaired loans. Charge-offs, net of recoveries, were $997,000 for the three months ended December 31, 2017, compared to $17,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2017 and net recoveries of $1,000 for the three months ended December 31, 2016. Loans classified as substandard and doubtful decreased $6.3 million or 25.7% to $18.3 million at December 31, 2017 from $24.6 million at September 30, 2017 and decreased $3.4 million or 15.9% from $21.7 million at December 31, 2016.\nNoninterest income decreased $1.6 million to $692,000 for the three months ended December 31, 2017 compared to the same period in 2016, due to a one-time settlement on an acquired loan of $1.6 million in the prior period, and decreased $22,000 from the three months ended June 30, 2017, due primarily to $173,000 in gains on sale of securities recognized in the prior quarter, partially offset by loan-related fees.\nNoninterest expense increased $331,000 to $8.1 million for the three months ended December 31, 2017 compared to the same period in 2016 and increased $231,000 from the three months ended September 30, 2017. The $331,000 increase was caused primarily by increases in salaries and employee benefits of $379,000 and in all other operating expenses of $500,000, partially offset by a decrease in occupancy expense of $548,000. The increase in salaries and benefits was due primarily to a $301,000 increase in retirement expenses, including ESOP expense which commenced in April 2017, and a $159,000 increase in salaries expense due primarily to increased staffing, partially offset by a $97,000 decrease in benefits expense due primarily to lower healthcare costs. The increase in other operating expenses was caused primarily by increases in Director and Officer insurance and other professional fees associated with being a public company, as well as increased advertising and data processing costs. Occupancy expense decreased due primarily to a $521,000 lease obligation write-off recorded in the prior period. The $231,000 increase in noninterest expense from the three months ended September 30, 2017 was primarily due to a loss recorded on a receivable.\nIncome tax expense increased $1.8 million to $2.6 million for the three months ended December 31, 2017 compared to the same period in 2016 as well as the prior quarter and was caused by the $1.8 million deferred tax re-measurement charge recorded in the current quarter. The effective income tax rate was 99.9% (31.3% excluding the effects of the re-measurement charge) for the three months ended December 31, 2017 as compared to 31.2% for the three months ended December 31, 2016.\nBalance Sheet Summary\nTotal assets increased $16.8 million to $1.44 billion at December 31, 2017 from $1.43 billion at June 30, 2017. This increase was primarily due to increases of $16.6 million in cash and cash equivalents and $28.5 million in net loans receivable, partially offset by a decrease of $25.1 million in total investment securities. The increase in cash and cash equivalents and loans was primarily funded by the increase in liabilities and the decrease in investment securities. The $28.5 million increase in net loans was primarily due to an increase of $43.5 million in commercial mortgage loans, partially offset by decreases of $6.0 million in construction loans, $4.1 million in residential mortgage loans, $2.0 million in commercial loans and $1.8 million in home equity lines of credit.\nTotal liabilities increased $14.2 million to $1.16 billion at December 31, 2017 from $1.15 billion at June 30, 2017. This increase was primarily due to an increase of $25.9 million in total deposits, partially offset by a $11.9 million decrease in advances from FHLB.\nTotal shareholders’ equity increased $2.6 million to $282.4 million at December 31, 2017 from $279.8 million at June 30, 2017. This increase was primarily due to net income of $1.8 million and a $1.3 million reduction in unearned ESOP shares for plan shares earned during the period. At December 31, 2017, the Company’s book value per share and tangible book value per share were $15.55 and $15.18, respectively, compared to $15.41 and $15.04, respectively, at June 30, 2017. For reconciliations of book value per share (GAAP measure) to tangible book value per share (non-GAAP measure), see page 13. At December 31, 2017, the Bank was considered “well capitalized” under applicable regulatory guidelines.\nAbout PCSB Financial Corporation and PCSB Bank\nPCSB Financial Corporation is the bank holding company for PCSB Bank.

(2) Adjusted efficiency ratio is a non-GAAP measure and is defined as noninterest expense, less certain nonrecurring items, divided by our operating revenue, which is equal to net interest income plus non-interest income excluding certain nonrecurring items. In our judgment, the adjustments made to operating revenue allow investors and analysts to better assess our operating expenses in relation to our core operating revenue by removing the volatility that is associated with certain one-time items and other discrete items that are unrelated to our core business. (3) Represents average shareholders' equity divided by average total assets. (4) Tangible book value per share is a non-GAAP measure and equals total shareholders’ equity, less goodwill and other intangible assets, divided by shares outstanding. We believe this disclosure may be meaningful to those investors who seek to evaluate our equity without giving effect to goodwill and other intangible assets.
