The 136-room Aloft Tempe in Ariz. The 135-room Hampton by Hilton Green Bay in Wis. The 123-room Element Denver Park Meadows in Colo. The 209-room Element Miami International Airport in Fla.\nThe company invested approximately $105 million in new acquisitions, an increase of nearly $30 million spent in 2016. The new acquisitions bring the portfolio to a total of 38 hotels year-to-date, encompassing 4,371 rooms.\nIn addition to the acquisitions, Peachtree completed five development deals last year:\nThe 98-room Hilton Garden Inn Jackson, Tenn. The 106-suite Home2 Suites by Hilton San Antonio Stone Oak in Texas The 140-room Hotel Indigo Celebration Pointe in Gainesville, Fla. The 100-room Courtyard by Marriott Kennesaw, Ga. The 90-suite Home2 Suites Prattville, Ala.\nThe company also divested four hotels totaling 676 rooms.\nPeachtree has an equally impressive pipeline for Q1 2018. The company’s acquisition targets include seven hotels from the Hilton, Marriott and IHG brand families throughout Virginia, Louisiana, Missouri and Nebraska totaling around 800 rooms at an estimated cost of $120 million. Additionally, the company plans to develop 11 hotels for roughly $255 million totaling about 1,300 rooms throughout Florida, Georgia, Indiana and Tennessee.\n“Our investors believe in our strategy of finding the ‘perfect’ marketplace for our hotels, which is not necessarily a Top 25 MSA for us,” Waldman added. “We believe our targeted geographic areas are better insulated to weather any potential downturns on the horizon. That being said, we are cautiously optimistic heading into the new year.”\n“We continue to have an aggressive appetite for new acquisition, development and joint venture opportunities heading into 2018,” said Brent LeBlanc, senior vice president. “Peachtree has the team and financial wherewithal in place to move quickly and strategically for deals that meet our strict investment criteria.”\nAbout Peachtree Hotel Group\nPeachtree Hotel Group operates, develops and invests in premium-branded, select- and limited-service and extended-stay hotel assets under the Marriott, Hilton, Hyatt, Choice and InterContinental Hotels Group flags.
