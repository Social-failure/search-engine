Ukrainians are also the most frequent nationality among foreigners found to be in the country illegally. \nUkraine, which is not in the EU, has been a favoured source of migrant workers for the Czech Republic due to its geographical proximity and cultural and linguistic links. \nUkraine’s own economy has suffered since the fall of the Soviet Union from mismanagement and corruption, and has been badly damaged by a nearly four-year conflict in the east of the country with separatists backed by Russia. \nThe Czech annual quota for easy access was already raised last year from previous 3,800. \nThe country of 10.6 million people had 216,629 job vacancies in December, the highest on record, versus 259,929 available unemployed workers. \nManufacturing is a key driver of economic growth in the Czech Republic, with foreign-owned firms feeding into multinational supply chains in the auto, machinery and electronics industries.
