In addition, the long economic recovery and expansion may collectively increase lender complacency,” the report said. \nThe OCC warned that if financial markets tighten quickly or the economy slows, banks could face greater risks from potential customer defaults. \nThe watchdog also highlighted increasingly complex cyber security challenges, banks’ growing reliance on third-party service providers, and ongoing difficulties complying with the Bank Secrecy Act as other key risks facing the industry.
