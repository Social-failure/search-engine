It also cut wheat subsidies, causing a quick doubling of bread prices.\nThe Sudanese pound hit an all-time low on the black market at 34 to the dollar on Monday amid a foreign currency shortage that has crippled the economy.\nSudanâ€™s economy has been struggling since the south seceded in 2011, taking with it three-quarters of its oil output. But the United States lifted 20-year-old sanctions on it in October, and the IMF has since advised it to embark on sweeping reforms including a currency float.\nSudan has ruled out floating the pound, however.\nReporting by Khalid Abdelaziz, writing by John Davison in Cairo; Editing by Richard Balmforth\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-01-16T18:49:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-16T13:10:06.005+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
