The recent rally has Gordon convinced that the chipmaker could break through the $46 upper range of the consolidation he sees on his chart.\nAs a result, Gordon wants to sell the Jan. 26 weekly 46-strike puts , and pair that with the purchase of the Jan. 26 weekly 44-strike puts, which gives him a credit of 73 cents, or around $73 per options spread.\nThe trader chose to sell a put spread heading into Intel earnings thanks to the increase in implied volatility, or the price of options, leading up to the event.\nThe trade has a breakeven point of around $45.22, above which Gordon would make money on the trade should Intel close above that point. If Intel closes above $46 on the Jan. 26 expiration, Gordon would make the $73 credit on the trade. But if Intel were to close below $44, he could face a maximum loss of $126.\nIntel was trading at just above $46 on Tuesday, meaning that Gordon is in a prime position to earn the $73 credit on the trade should the stock remain above that key level.\nVote Vote to see results Total Votes: Not a Scientific Survey.
