(NYSE: GCO) announced today that Mimi Eckel Vaughn, currently the Company's senior vice president and chief financial officer, is to be named chief operating officer of the Company once her successor as chief financial officer is appointed. The Company has launched a search for a new chief financial officer.\nVaughn, a 14-year veteran of the Company, joined Genesco as vice president – strategy and business development in 2003, was promoted to senior vice president – strategy and business development in 2006, and was named senior vice president – strategy and shared services in 2009. In this role, she was responsible for strategy development for the Company and for growth initiatives and acquisitions.

First as head of corporate strategy and shared services and more recently as CFO, she has gained a deep understanding of all Genesco's businesses and of the markets in which we operate. Mimi has been a key contributor in the growth and expansion of our Company during her tenure with Genesco. Her strategic insight and financial acumen in combination with her enthusiasm for Genesco's position and prospects make her ideally suited for a broader role in the Company's leadership.
