In April, Trump told Reuters he would either renegotiate or terminate what he called a “horrible” trade deal that has doubled the U.S. goods trade deficit with South Korea since 2012. \nOn Monday, Kim told reporters that he expects “an uphill battle for the talks. There is lots of work to do during a short period of time.” \nHe said he expected Trump’s administration to step up protectionism moves to rally his domestic supporters this year. A DIFFERENT APPROACH \nBut South Korea’s trade ministry said that while Washington seeks to significantly change the North American Free Trade Agreement with Mexico and Canada, the U.S. wants a “partial revision” of its deal with Seoul, which will speed up the talks. \n“They are trying to take a different approach on KORUS FTA from that on the NAFTA,,” Yoo Myung-hee, a director general, told reporters. \nYoo, who led the latest trade talks with U.S., also said “all types of auto issues were raised” in Washington, without giving details. \nA top priority for the Americans is maintaining a tariff of 25 percent on imports of Korean pickup trucks, which the existing deal envisaged to be phased out from 2019, sources have said. \nSouth Korean auto companies believe Washington will also seek to increase the 25,000-vehicle per U.S. automaker threshold for shipments to South Korea that can enter the country without meeting Seoul’s domestic safety regulations. South Korea’s vehicle emissions rules are likely to be also on the table, they said. \nThe trade ministry also earlier expected U.S. to demand tougher rules on regional content for the auto sector.
