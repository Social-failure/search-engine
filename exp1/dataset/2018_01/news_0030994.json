In at least two H&M outlets in South Africa, the opposition Economic Freedom Fighters party staged anti-racism protests , trashing the stores. Several celebrities, including NBA star LeBron James and rapper Diddy , expressed outrage, while others, like singer The Weeknd , canceled their partnerships with the brand. And according to the BBC , the family of the five-year-old model at the center of the controversy has been forced to move houses “for security reasons.” \nIn response to the outrage, H&M apologized for the incident, took down the advertisement, and pulled the hoodie from its collection.
