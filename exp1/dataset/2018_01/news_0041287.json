Lebanese banking and political authorities have lobbied Washington to make sure its anti-Hezbollah measures do not destroy the banking system underpinning the economy.\nIn his meetings with President Michel Aoun, Prime Minister Saad al-Hariri and other banking and political figures, Billingslea said the U.S. government was committed to work with Lebanon to protect its financial system and support a “strong, stable, and prosperous Lebanon”.\nBillingslea also said Washington would help Lebanon protect its financial system from Islamic State and other militants.\nTwo weeks ago, the Trump administration set up a team to reinvigorate U.S. investigations into Hezbollah-linked drug trafficking.\nHezbollah leader Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah last week denied any involvement in drug trafficking and said Hezbollah had a very clear religious and moral stance which forbids drugs and drug trading.\nReporting by Lisa Barrington; editing by Grant McCool\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-24T00:41:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-24T00:53:07.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
