Investments within Saudi Arabia include a 16.2 percent stake in lender Banque Saudi Fransi 1050.SE. \nThe assets of Prince Alwaleed, who is in his early 60s, appeared at risk of seizure or liquidation when he was detained in November in a crackdown on corruption. A Saudi official said he was accused of money laundering, bribery and extortion. \nKingdom Holding’s share price plunged as much as 23 percent in following days, wiping about $2.2 billion off his fortune. \nBut the stock has since recovered about half its losses. The prince’s release on Saturday could help it rebound further. \nTerms of the release have not so far been disclosed. A senior Saudi official told Reuters the prince was freed after a financial settlement over “violations” to which he had admitted. But the official gave no details, beyond saying Prince Alwaleed would continue to head Kingdom Holding. \nPrince Alwaleed told Reuters in the final hours of his captivity that he maintained his innocence of any wrongdoing, and did not expect to have to hand over assets to the state. \nThe prince also said he was able to communicate with executives at his business during his detention, and that Kingdom Holding would remain under his ownership. \nFINANCE MINISTER‘S SON \nPrince Alwaleed, whose father was the Saudi finance minister in the 1960s, formed Kingdom Holding in 1979, initially pouring money into real estate in Riyadh. In the 1990s, he ventured into Wall Street, investing heavily in Citigroup. \nHe had a close relationship with former Citigroup Chief Executive Sanford “Sandy” Weill, and has nurtured close ties with other Wall Street leaders including Goldman Sachs ( GS.N ) chief executive Lloyd Blankfein. \n“He’s always been a colorful and unofficial public face of Saudi Arabia, though he has never been a key decision-maker in the kingdom,” a Gulf-based businessman said. \nWell before he was detained, Prince Alwaleed publicly endorsed economic and social reforms pushed by Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, who launched the crackdown on corruption. \nPrince Alwaleed was an early advocate of women’s employment in Saudi Arabia and ending a ban on women driving. In September, King Salman ordered the driving ban to be lifted this year. \nThe prince has also been outspoken in the international arena. During the U.S. election campaign, he called Donald Trump a “disgrace” and said he should withdraw from the campaign after Trump pledged to ban Muslims’ entry into the United States. \nTrump responded by tweeting that the Saudi prince wanted to control “our politicians with daddy’s money. Can’t do it after I get elected.” \nFollowing the vote, Prince Alwaleed congratulated Trump on his victory and said that, whatever past differences, America had spoken.
