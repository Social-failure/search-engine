He has described reports he could leave as “garbage”. \nMourinho won the League Cup and Europa League in his first season in charge, though United finished sixth in the league. \nThey currently sit second, 12 points behind local rivals Manchester City, and are in the Champions League last 16 and FA Cup fourth round.
