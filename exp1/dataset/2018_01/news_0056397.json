The memo is based on highly-classified material and alleges that an associate of Trump was surveilled improperly, according to people familiar with it. \nBut on Tuesday, Trump suggested he had already decided to approve the release. His assertion seemed to undermine White House chief of staff John Kelly’s assurance that no decision would be reached until the National Security Council and White House lawyers had time to vet the material before it is made public.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-31T20:34:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-31T20:45:11.017+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
