Thereafter we will see how we can move the project forward once we are satisfied that normalcy has returned,” she told Reuters, adding the EU would be involved.\nKenya’s economy relies heavily on farming and tourism.\nReporting by Duncan Miriri; editing by John Stonestreet\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-01-17T23:38:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-18T15:59:06.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
