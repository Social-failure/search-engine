At mid-2017, ZKB’s common equity tier 1 ratio was 15.7 percent of risk-weighted assets. \nBig banks UBS and Credit Suisse also use internal risk-measuring models, which under new international rules taking effect from 2022 may not undershoot capital requirements from standard models as much as they can now. \nUBS has said its risk-weighted assets could rise by 35 billion Swiss francs ($37.6 billion) as a result of the new approach. It plans to top up its hard capital by 4 billion francs over the next three years to help fulfil the new regulatory demands.
