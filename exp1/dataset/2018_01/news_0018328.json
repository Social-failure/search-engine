Hachimura scored 10 points to complement eight rebounds and three blocks.\nBoum tallied a game-high 22 points for San Francisco, which was opening a four-game homestand.\nFerrari had 18 points and Ratinho 16 for the Dons, who have lost two in a row. The two-game losing streak is just San Francisco’s second of the season.\nSan Francisco scored more than half its points on 3-pointers, making 12 of 28 attempts from beyond the arc. Boum (four), Ratinho (four) and Ferrari (three) combined for 11 of the 12 successes.\nGonzaga took the lead for good with a 7-0 run early in the game that broke an 11-all tie.
