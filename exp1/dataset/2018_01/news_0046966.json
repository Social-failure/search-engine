Europe has some catching up to do.” \nFDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb, whom Trump brought in, aims to approve drugs based on very early data if they show a possible survival benefit, among other measures to get medicines on the market faster. \nAfter he was elected, Trump blasted drug companies, saying they had been “getting away with murder” with high prices. \nWhile the Trump administration has since sought to change how hospitals are reimbursed for some drugs, his selection of Gottlieb, with deep ties to the drug industry, eased worries that he would seek a confrontation. \n“Fears that Trump would damage the pharmaceuticals branch have not been realized,” Franz, who was in Davos for the World Economic Forum meeting, told Blick in the interview. \n“It’s quite the opposite. We see new opportunities.” Reporting by John Miller; Editing by Mark Potter", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-26T10:41:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-26T11:05:16.006+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
