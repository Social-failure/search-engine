The fourth-quarter 2017 and 2016 results include impacts from Tax Adjustments and Other Items; 2017 includes a net positive impact of $8.15 per diluted share, and 2016 includes a net negative impact of $0.37 per diluted share.\nNet income for the full-year 2017 was $502.0 million or $12.75 per diluted share, compared to $257.1 million or $6.29 per diluted share in the prior year. The 2017 and 2016 full-year results include net benefits from Tax Adjustments and Other Items of $8.05 per diluted share and $0.52 per diluted share, respectively.\nDetails related to Tax Adjustments and Other Items are provided in the attached Supplemental Information. The 2017 fourth quarter and full year Tax Adjustments and Other Items each include an estimated one-time, non-cash net benefit associated with the recently enacted Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. The most significant component of this net benefit is a reduction in our net deferred tax liability resulting from a lower future U.S. corporate tax rate.\nBrian A. Kenney, president and chief executive officer of GATX stated, “We outperformed our original expectations in 2017. Continued industry-wide railcar overcapacity negatively impacted lease renewal pricing at Rail North America, however outstanding performance by our commercial team enabled us to maintain higher than expected fleet utilization throughout the year. We also capitalized on continued strong North American secondary market demand by optimizing the fleet through railcar sales, generating significant remarketing income. Rail International maintained higher average fleet utilization than expected during the year, while American Steamship earned significantly higher segment profit in 2017 by carrying more tonnage and operating their fleet more efficiently. Lastly, within Portfolio Management, our Rolls-Royce Partners Finance affiliates produced another year of higher than expected financial results.\nMr. Kenney added, “We anticipate railcar overcapacity to continue in North America in 2018. However, certain industry data points suggest that the railcar leasing market is slowly improving. For example, throughout 2017, railcar loadings generally improved; and absolute railcar lease rates increased broadly, albeit off a very low base. Despite these positive signs, we expect that absent an unforeseen demand catalyst, Rail North America will earn lower segment profit in 2018, as market lease rates are expected to remain below average expiring rates for railcars renewing during the year. Rail International is expected to show higher profitability in 2018, primarily due to a stronger Euro. ASC is expected to produce higher segment profit in 2018 due to freight rate escalation and further fleet efficiencies. We anticipate that Portfolio Management will generate lower residual sharing income in 2018, however, this should be partially offset by another strong year at our Rolls-Royce Partners Finance affiliates.\n“GATX has executed numerous strategic initiatives to enhance our competitive advantage and outperform in any market conditions. As a result, we currently expect 2018 earnings to be in the range of $4.55-$4.75 per diluted share, which would be excellent financial performance at this point in the industry cycle. This range incorporates an impact of approximately $0.20 per diluted share resulting from lower U.S. corporate tax rates effective in 2018.”\nRAIL NORTH AMERICA\nRail North America reported segment profit of $61.2 million in the fourth quarter of 2017, compared to $48.5 million in the fourth quarter of 2016. Full-year 2017, Rail North America reported segment profit of $299.3 million, compared to $321.9 million in 2016. The decline in full-year 2017 segment profit was primarily the result of lower revenues. Segment profit in 2016 included an impairment loss of $29.8 million for certain railcars in flammable service. This impairment is included in Tax Adjustments and Other Items in the attached Supplemental Information.\nAt December 31, 2017, Rail North America’s wholly owned fleet was approximately 120,000 cars, including more than 16,000 boxcars. The following fleet statistics exclude the boxcar fleet.\nFleet utilization was 98.2% at the end of the fourth quarter, compared to 98.5% at the end of the prior quarter and 98.9% at 2016 year end. During the fourth quarter, the renewal lease rate change of the GATX Lease Price Index (“LPI”) was negative 32.4%. This compares to negative 27.0% in the prior quarter and negative 36.2% in the fourth quarter of 2016. The average lease renewal term for all cars included in the LPI during the fourth quarter was 36 months, compared to 35 months in the prior quarter and 29 months in the fourth quarter of 2016. The fourth-quarter renewal success rate was 74.8%, compared to 74.9% at the end of the prior quarter and 64.7% at 2016 year end.\nFor full-year 2017, the renewal lease rate change of the LPI was negative 28.2% and the average renewal term was 33 months, compared to negative 20.3% and 32 months in 2016. Renewal success rate for the year was 74.7% compared to 66.7% in 2016. Asset remarketing income for the year was $44.6 million and total investment volume was $460.9 million.\nAdditional fleet statistics, including information on the boxcar fleet, and macroeconomic data related to Rail North America’s business are provided on the last page of this press release.\nRAIL INTERNATIONAL\nRail International’s segment profit was $18.7 million in the fourth quarter of 2017, compared to $14.1 million in the fourth quarter of 2016. Rail International reported full-year segment profit of $68.8 million in 2017, compared to $63.0 million in 2016. The fourth quarter and full-year 2017 segment profit increase was primarily driven by more railcars on lease at GATX Rail Europe (“GRE”) and lower maintenance costs.\nAt the end of 2017, GRE’s fleet consisted of approximately 23,000 cars and utilization was 96.8%, compared to 95.6% at the end of the third quarter and at 2016 year end.\nAdditional fleet statistics for GATX Rail Europe are provided on the last page of this press release.\nAMERICAN STEAMSHIP COMPANY\nAmerican Steamship Company (“ASC”) reported a segment profit of $6.1 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 compared to a segment loss of $2.8 million in the fourth quarter of 2016. Segment profit for full-year 2017 was $24.5 million, compared to $10.1 million in 2016. The increase in quarterly and full year segment profit is primarily attributable to more tonnage and increased operational efficiency. Additionally, in the fourth quarter of 2016, ASC reported $5.0 million of expense related to an increased accrual for pending litigation and costs associated with the scheduled return of a leased vessel.\nASC operated 12 vessels during the year and carried approximately 27.8 million net tons of cargo, compared to 11 vessels which carried 25.4 million net tons in 2016.\nPORTFOLIO MANAGEMENT\nPortfolio Management reported segment profit of $9.0 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 compared to $17.7 million in the fourth quar", "external_links": ["https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=X-tiWKKaK3szYMVQG_rHw1NUa4QNSetdgpH2dmkqAJkNJ5rggYORaCimTi6njnJl4OqIUpQhZZ_vvcMeAM5dzA=="], "published": "2018-01-18T16:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-18T16:23:43.017+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
