Vladimir Brodziansky added 21 points before fouling out early in overtime for TCU (13-4, 1-4).\nOklahoma’s defense, which had struggled throughout much of the game, gave the Sooners a chance in the final seconds when Jamuni McNeace blocked Alex Robinson’s shot.\nMcNeace’s rebound gave the Sooners the ball with 15.9 seconds left coming out of a timeout and TCU clinging to a one-point lead.\nYoung looked to drive toward the basket before flinging the ball to James for the corner 3-pointer.\nBut TCU forced overtime as Fisher, who missed a potential game-winning layup at Texas on Wednesday, this time drove to the basket and finished to send the game to overtime.\nWith 12:49 remaining, Young picked up his third foul -- a charge -- and headed to the bench with the Sooners up four, 63-59.\nTCU didn’t take much advantage with Young off the floor for about four minutes, cutting the Sooners’ lead by one one.\nBut when Young and Brady Manek checked back into the game, the Horned Frogs started to make a push. TCU scored 16 points in seven possessions to go ahead by six, its largest lead of the game, with less than five minutes remaining.\nThen Young heated up once again, driving to the baseline and hitting an acrobatic reverse layup as he was fouled.\nOn Oklahoma’s next possession, he drained a step-back 3-pointer -- his eighth of the game -- to cut the Horned Frogs’ lead to one.\n--Field Level Media\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-01-14T04:57:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-14T20:24:35.026+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
