User numbers totalled 60 million, or 4 percent of China’s mobile user population, according to Xinhua.\nChina has been slowly opening up its telecom market.\nLast year, it introduced a $12 billion ownership reform for China Unicom, which on Tuesday proposed to name representatives from China’s tech companies - Tencent Holdings, Alibaba Group, Baidu Inc and JD.com - as members on its enlarged board following their investment.\n$1 = 6.3740 Chinese yuan renminbi Reporting by Sijia Jiang; Editing by Himani Sarkar\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-01-24T19:05:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-25T13:02:51.029+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
