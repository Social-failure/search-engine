This death will haunt us politically,” said Nevenka Medic, a Mitrovica Serb, clutching a red rose to place on Ivanovic’s grave. \nIvanovic rose to prominence shortly after the war as one of Mitrovica’s “bridge-watchers” - nationalist Serbs who sought to block “infiltration” by Albanians over the Ibar River bridge into the northern half of the town. \nAfter the group disbanded, Ivanovic entered politics and became known as a relative moderate for advocating post-war dialogue and compromise with Kosovo Albanians, while still refusing to recognise Kosovo’s 2008 independence from Serbia. \nSerbs from Belgrade and from Kosovo queued to lay wreaths and flowers and offer condolences to Ivanovic’s wife who stood next to the coffin in front of the cemetery’s main chapel.

REUTERS/Djordje Kojadinovic \nAmong them were top Serbian government officials including Prime Minister Ana Brnabic and Foreign Minister Ivica Dacic, as well as opposition leaders. \n“He was heard with attention by both foreigners and Serbs and often Albanians, for him Kosovo was more than just territory and politics,” Orthodox Bishop Teodosije said in a eulogy. \nAn EU-sponsored dialogue on the normalisation of ties between Serbia and Kosovo was suspended when Belgrade’s delegation walked out after the killing, saying it would return only once Ivanovic’s killers are brought to justice.

About 4,600 NATO troops remain in Kosovo as peacekeepers. \nKosovo police said they had traced the owner of a burnt car believed to be linked to the killers and were interviewing potential witnesses. No one heard the shots as, according to investigators, the gunman likely used a silencer. \nIn 2016, Ivanovic was convicted by an European Union-run court of inciting murders of ethnic Albanians during the war and sentenced to nine years in prison. He appealed, arguing the evidence was forged, and a retrial was ordered. \nSerbian officials said the accusations were trumped up. \nKosovo’s estimated 50,000 Serbs live in a northern pocket that has been in legal limbo since the war - politically loyal to Serbia but effectively a no-go territory for both Serbian and Kosovo police, with Serb criminal gangs - some of whose members are ex-“bridge-watchers” - exerting a powerful grip. \nIvanovic’s car was set on fire last year in what he called a politically motivated attack. \nHis widow Milena said she planned to move to Belgrade along with their 7-year old son. “My son and I have finished with Mitrovica - it’s a town of fear, darkness and pain,” she said.
