Now, markets are waiting for the annual budget,” said R.K. Gupta, managing director at Taurus Asset Management.\nThe NSE index was down 0.22 percent at 11,061.75 as of 0616 GMT, but was set to end the week 1.53 percent higher.\nThe benchmark BSE index was 0.26 percent lower at 36,065.95, but was on track to post a weekly gain of 1.57 percent.\nBoth the indexes were on course to post their fourth weekly gain this year.\nIndian share markets will be closed on Friday for a public holiday.\nShares in State Bank of India and other big state-run banks fell as they stood to receive less money than investors had expected from the government’s much-awaited recapitalisation plan.\nIndia’s government pledged on Wednesday to inject nearly $14 billion combined into all but one state-run lender by March in return for them implementing reforms, in a bid to boost lending and tackle a record bad debt problem.\nSBI shares were the biggest drag on the broader NSE index , falling as much as 4.5 percent.\nInvestors booked profits in IT stocks, with the Nifty IT index slipping 1.9 percent after gaining in the last seven sessions. Infosys Ltd fell 2 percent while Tata Consultancy Services Ltd slid 2.2 percent.\nMeanwhile, Biocon Ltd fell as much as 5.4 percent after posting a 46 percent drop in third-quarter profit.
