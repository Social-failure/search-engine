He was arrested in late 2015 and charged with collusion with groups outlawed by the Addis Ababa government.\nThe ruling coalition has indicated that cases against some 400 other detainees held at the regional level are being discontinued, U.N. human rights spokesman Liz Throssell told a news briefing.\n“These are positive developments. We urge the government to continue to take steps to release individuals detained for expressing their political views,” Throssell said.\nThe opposition leader’s release coincides with mounting concerns over the long-term stability of one of the fastest growing economies in the region.\n“We do think that Ethiopia is at a key moment and that’s why we are saying that we stand ready to help Ethiopia,” Throssell said.\nHundreds were killed during two years of violence triggered by allegations of land grabs in Ethiopia’s central Oromiya province, with protests then broadening into demonstrations over political restrictions and perceived rights abuses.\n“We don’t have an exact figure on the number of people that have been in detention. We do think that it is in the thousands,” Throssell said, adding they included “political detainees”.\n“We have reports that during the unrest and the state of emergency, more than 20,000 people were detained. Some of those were subsequently released, but we do believe that there are still a high number of people in detention,” she said.\nThrossell urged the Ethiopian government to review anti-terror legislation and laws “to ensure that they are neither interpreted nor implemented too broadly, thereby resulting in people being arbitrarily or wrongfully detained,” she said.\nLaws placing “undue restrictions” on non-governmental organizations and restricting the media should also be revised.\nReporting by Stephanie Nebehay; Editing by Toby Chopra\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-19T16:56:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-19T17:04:18.017+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
