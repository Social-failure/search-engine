The “Ampere” scenario would close 16 reactors and leave the share of nuclear at 46 percent.\nTwo more radical scenarios, “Watt” and “Hertz”, would close as many as 52 and 25 reactors respectively, with the Watt scenario cutting the share of nuclear to as little as 11 percent. The remaining power would come from renewables (71 percent) and gas (18 percent).\n“The Watt and Hertz scenarios were eliminated from the presentations at the government’s request,” said Yves Marignac of NegaWatt, a group which advocates higher renewables use.\nNegaWatt took part in two workshops to prepare the public debate on the issue. It was joined by several energy-focused NGOs, EDF, nuclear firm Orano, and lobby groups. The debates are supposed to lead to a first draft of a multi-year energy plan by summer and a final plan in early 2019.\nIts conclusions will be crucial for European power markets as they will determine how much nuclear baseload capacity remains available.\nA source involved with organizing the workshops confirmed the government had instructed RTE to withdraw two scenarios.\n“All scenarios were mentioned, but only two were reviewed in detail,” he said.\nA ministry spokeswoman said two scenarios had indeed been removed from the presentation but declined to give details.\n“It is inconceivable that these two scenarios would be withheld from public debate,” NegaWatt’s Thierry Salomon said.\nFrance has withheld key information on nuclear before.\nIn the months before the parliament vote on the 2015 energy law, Hulot’s predecessor Segolene Royal barred publication of an environment agency ADEME report showing France could switch to 100 percent renewables without extra costs.\n“At least this time the information is public. But it looks like the government is putting the interests of the nuclear industry ahead of the energy policy debate,” Salomon said.\n> Link to ADEME report story: tinyurl.com/y84ow838\nReporting by Geert De Clercq.
