Deputies were chasing them when the shooting erupted and one officer was struck by gunfire, the Tacoma News Tribune newspaper reported. \n“White male suspect found deceased at the scene, black male suspect remains unidentified and on the loose,” the sheriff’s office said. \nPolice said a manhunt was under way for the second suspect. They did not immediately say how the white suspect died. \n“It is with incredible sadness ... that our deputy has passed away from his injuries,” the sheriff’s department said.
