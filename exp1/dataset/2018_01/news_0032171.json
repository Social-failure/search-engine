I remember the days when we had four days of 40 degrees in a row a few years back. Now we got two,” he said.\n“It’s definitely a challenge. It’s hard to prepare for that in some ways. But you know when you come down here that can happen. I‘m happy I played at nighttime. But I would back myself playing during the daytime also.”\nTennis - Australian Open - Rod Laver Arena, Melbourne, Australia, January 18, 2018. Jan-Lennard Struff of Germany hits a shot against Roger Federer of Switzerland. REUTERS/Thomas Peter Federer broke the Struff serve in the fifth game when he ripped a forehand past the advancing German.\nThat proved enough to take the first set and he needed just one break, this time achieved with a rasping backhand pass, to claim the decisive break at 3-3 in the second.\nFederer could never truly relax though and Struff broke for a 3-1 lead in the third set with some forceful tennis.\nHis advantage did not last long though as Federer replied in the next game and from then on Federer assumed control.\nAdditional reporting by Ian Ransom,; Editing by Pritha Sarkar\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-01-18T21:15:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-19T12:12:28.010+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
