But it has maintained its $67 ceiling of resistance for months — a level Moreno doesn't think will hold for much longer.\nMoreno pointed to the chart's stochastic oscillator, a tool that measures whether a stock is overbought or oversold.\n\"The oscillator just recently ... crossed above the center line. When it does that, Moreno says that's a sign that the stock is ready to gallop — important since it's only a buck away from the ceiling of resistance,\" Cramer said. \"This four-month period of consolidation, which has been torture, is like a coiled spring, he says, ready to propel the stock higher.\"\nMoreno had a similar outlook for Electronic Arts, which produces Battlefield, The Sims and a host of licensed sports games including FIFA.\n\nLike Activision, Electronic Arts' stock had been consolidating for months before forming a cup-and-handle pattern in December under its $110 ceiling of resistance.\nBut even though the stock has trumped its ceiling, closing Wednesday at $112.25, its trajectory remains murky. While its relative strength index, a key momentum indicator, has been trending higher, its accumulation/distribution line, a tool that measures money flow, has stayed flat.\n\"This is going to need to pick up before Moreno will really believe that EA is ready to run, but once it does, he thinks the stock could have a ton of upside,\" Cramer said.\nSo as the gaming industry continues its seemingly unstoppable uptrend in 2018, Cramer and Moreno expect the rising tide to lift these boats.\n\"The video game space remains one of the hottest secular growth groups around, and I think these stocks have more room to run in 2018, including Take-Two Interactive,\" the \"Mad Money\" host said. \"But the charts ... suggest that Electronic Arts and Activision Blizzard could end up giving you better performance this year as they start to play catch-up to this tremendous out-performer run by Strauss Zelnick .\"\nWATCH: Cramer's charts bullish for video game names show chapters Cramer's charts show video game stocks like Take-Two have more room to run      17 Hours Ago | 10:46 Questions for Cramer?\nCall Cramer: 1-800-743-CNBC\nWant to take a deep dive into Cramer's world?
