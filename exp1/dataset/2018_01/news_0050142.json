He called it Trump. \n“I have some other wolves but this one has a lot of energy in everything and he is very smart,” Rexha, who likes to be called a holistic vet, told Reuters from his small farm in western Kosovo. \nRexha, who puts his hand in the mouths of his wolves, has named himself an Alfa Wolf and made Trump his deputy. \n“I admire (President) Trump, he has a lot of energy, he gives orders, he is a brave man, that’s why I named my wolf because he does the same things. He does not do what others do; he has his own style and does his mission.” \nHe also has different chickens, pigeons, horses, cows, an eagle and peacocks.

REUTERS/Hazir Reka \nIn a survey by Gallup International this month about how people rate the performance of United States government officials, Kosovo was ranked first in the world with 75 percent of Kosovars approving of Donald Trump’s administration. \nWashington is Kosovo’s strongest ally politically and economically.

I see Trump as a wolf and my wolf as Trump,” Rexha said.
