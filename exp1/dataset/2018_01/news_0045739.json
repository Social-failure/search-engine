Lenovo ( 0992.HK ), Oppo and Vivo came in behind them, each with about 6 percent market share. \nHowever, it ranked Samsung as the top seller for the year as the South Korean company was well ahead of Xiaomi in the first half of 2017.

REUTERS/Anindito Mukherjee \nSeparately, research firm Canalys said Xiaomi shipped 8.2 million smartphones in the fourth quarter, while Samsung shipped 7.3 million. \n“Multiple factors have contributed to Xiaomi’s growth, but the key reason for its current success lies in the autonomy that it granted its Indian unit, letting it run the business locally,” said Canalys analyst Ishan Dutt. \nCanalys estimates Xiaomi has 27 percent of the Indian market while Samsung is on 25 percent. \n“Samsung’s loss comes from its inability to transform its low-cost product portfolio,” said Rushabh Doshi of Canalys. \nThe South Korean company has been unable to win over cost-conscious buyers, thereby losing market share in the sub-15,000 rupee ($235) segment to Xiaomi quarter after quarter, he said. \nSamsung said in a statement that it led Indian smartphone sales in the September to November period, based on data by research firm GfK. \nXiaomi could not immediately be reached for comment.
