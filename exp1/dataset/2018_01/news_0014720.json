( cnb.cx/2CQevyH )\nHe added that the company has already identified “a whole list of partners” and was also considering partnerships with competitors.\n“If we had our preference, we are going first after well-capitalized companies, and preferably ones that have high traffic in grocery and convenience,” Mansell told the news channel on the sidelines of the ICR Conference in Orlando.\nKohl’s could not be immediately reached for comment.\nThe company has been cutting the size of some of its large stores to better manage inventories and other costs, and is also building out small-format stores to access customers in suburbs.\nIt posted strong holiday sales on Monday, helped by online sales, the revamp of its beauty departments, and partnerships with brands such as Under Armour and Nike.\nThe company’s shares are up 9 percent since the report and hit a more than one-year high of $59.25 on Wednesday.
