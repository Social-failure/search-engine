Sometimes they work and sometimes they dont. For most of 2017, the relationship between the dollar and the oil price was not obvious,\" PVM Oil Associates strategist Tamas Varga said in a note.\n\"This is the trend that seems to be turning, judging by yesterdays price action and this mornings moves. Rising U.S. bond yields caused dollar shorts cover and as a result oil prices fell.\"\nExpectations for U.S. inventories to rise for the first time in 11 weeks may also be keeping oil under pressure, according to a preliminary poll by Reuters on Monday.\nU.S. production is already on par with that of Saudi Arabia, the biggest producer in the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC). Only Russia produces more, averaging 10.98 million barrels per day (bpd) in 2017.\nU.S. output <C-OUT-T-EIA> has jumped more than 17 percent since mid-2016 and is expected to exceed 10 million bpd soon.\nThe rising tide of U.S. oil output comes after prices rose following an agreement by OPEC producers, along with Russia and other countries, on output curbs.\n(Additional reporting by Henning Gloystein; Editing by Louise Heavens and Susan Fenton)", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-30T14:16:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-30T15:12:27.013+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
