With nonessential government offices closed, Ware said, volatility tends to increase. He pointed out that the last three shutdowns resulted in the market going higher. \nBut the possibility of a government shutdown might not be the source of the market's movement. Market watchers should pay close attention to this season's earnings to determine how the new GOP tax plan will affect companies, said David Kelly, chief global strategist at J.P. Morgan Funds. \n\"It's immensely complicated,\" he said. \"All of the equity analysts are working overtime to figure out who the real winners are going to be here. And there are a lot of winners from this, and I think that's what is helping the market move higher.\" \nBut as tax cuts help fuel the economy, Kelly cautioned investors. \n\"Do not get sucked into this uber exuberance here, because there will be another recession,\" he warned. \"There will be a bear market at some stage. And when it occurs, those things that are flying highest today are going to take the biggest hit.\" \nThe deadline for a spending deal to prevent a government shutdown is midnight Friday.
