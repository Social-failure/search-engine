They don’t even want to negotiate a long overdue peace treaty with Israel ... with the Palestinians no longer willing to talk peace, why should we make any of these massive future payments to them?” Trump said on Twitter. \nThe United States is the largest donor to the agency, with a pledge of nearly $370 million as of 2016, according to UNRWA’s website.
