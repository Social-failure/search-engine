Slideshow (10 Images) \nIn her previous match, Wozniacki had to save two match points on an epic comeback from 5-1 down in the third set against Croatian Jana Fett, so she was thrilled to avoid another drawn-out battle against Bertens. \n“Right now I‘m playing with house money,” the Dane, a semi-finalist at Melbourne Park in 2011, said in her post-match interview on court. \n“Right now I’ve got nothing to lose ... I got a second chance and I‘m going to try to take it and see how far I can go.” \nWozniacki will meet Slovakian 19th seed Magdalena Rybarikova for a place in the quarter-finals.
