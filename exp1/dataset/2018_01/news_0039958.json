Asked if he would return to frontline politics, he said: “Doubt it.”\nFarage declined to comment on the confusion inside UKIP, where leader Henry Bolton has refused to resign since his 25-year-old lover, Jo Marney, made offensive comments about Markle and black people in text messages to a friend.\nMarney who began dating Bolton just after Christmas, described U.S. actress Markle, whose father is white and mother is African-American, as a “dumb little commoner” and said “her seed with (sic) taint our royal family”, according to the texts printed in a Sunday newspaper.\nMarney also described black people as ugly. She later apologized for the text messages and Bolton said they were ending the “romantic element” of their relationship.\nCHARISMA BYPASS Without the charisma of Farage, a former metals trader who charmed the media, UKIP has suffered.\nHis first successor, Diane James, resigned after just 18 days and her successor, Paul Nuttall, quit after UKIP won 1.8 percent of votes cast in last June’s national election.\nBolton lost a vote of confidence from the party’s national executive committee on Sunday but he insisted that he would not step down. He has said the texts from his lover about Markle were “abhorrent, unwise and offensive.”\nUKIP’s deputy leader, Margot Parker, resigned in protest at Bolton’s refusal to go, the BBC reported.\nLed by Farage, UKIP won nearly four million votes - 12.6 percent of those cast - in the previous national election in 2015 on its anti-EU platform, projecting it to the forefront of British politics even though it only managed to win one seat in parliament.\nIts popularity prompted Cameron, who once dismissed the party as being full of “fruitcakes, loonies and closet racists”, to hold the referendum and played a major role in securing the vote to leave the EU.\nReporting by Guy Faulconbridge; editing by Michael Holden and John Stonestreet\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-22T10:11:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-22T10:36:37.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
