The scandal has claimed high-level political scalps across Latin America.\nThe U.S. Department of Homeland Security arrested Baldizon following an Interpol alert resulting from a Guatemalan arrest warrant, the U.S. embassy in Guatemala said.\n“The United States will follow established international protocols to return Mr. Baldizon to Guatemala to face justice,” the embassy said, referring all further questions to Guatemalan authorities.\nBaldizon requested asylum in the United States, Guatemala’s foreign ministry said in a statement.\nFILE PHOTO: Democratic Liberty Party's (LIDER) presidential candidate Manuel Baldizon gestures during a political rally in Mixco, on the outskirts of Guatemala City, August 30, 2015. REUTERS/Jorge Dan Lopez/File Photo U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, which falls under Homeland Security’s jurisdiction, did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\nBaldizon is wanted in Guatemala on charges of illicit association, bribery and money laundering, the prosecutor’s office said in a statement.\nThe statement said former Infrastructure Minister and brief presidential candidate Alejandro Sinibaldi was also wanted on suspected corruption charges stemming from the Odebrecht investigation, and was now a fugitive.\nThe prosecutor’s office did not give any information on the link with Odebrecht, which has admitted to paying multimillion-dollar bribes across Latin America and has already spent $3.5 billion for settlements in the United States, Brazil and Switzerland.\nThe prosecutor’s office carried out 10 raids on Saturday and arrested three people as part of the Odebrecht investigation, the statement added.\nIn 2016, the head of Guatemala’s special anti-corruption prosecutor’s office told Reuters he had already been investigating Odebrecht’s bribes to a government official, and President Jimmy Morales said his administration would check all of the company’s contracts.\nReporting by Sofia Menchu; Additional reporting by Zachary Fagenson; Writing by Gabriel Stargardter; Editing by Lisa Von Ahn\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-21T21:26:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-21T21:40:55.012+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
