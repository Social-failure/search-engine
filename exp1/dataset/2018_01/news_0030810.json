One stick will cost 400 yen ($3.60).\nBarry Callebaut unveiled the ruby variety in September, creating a fourth kind of chocolate in addition to dark, milk and white. After more than 10 years of development, it is the first new kind of chocolate in decades.\nIt said ruby chocolate used in KitKat “has a fresh berry-fruity taste and characteristic color”.\nRuby chocolate is made from the ruby cocoa bean. No berries, berry flavor or color are added.\nThere are already hundreds of KitKat products in Japan, including green tea and strawberry flavors, and a luxury version topped with nuts and dried fruit.\nChocolate companies, under pressure by consumers’ increasing health consciousness, are looking for ways to make their products more interesting.\n($1 = 111.1600 yen)\nReporting by Martinne Geller in London and Michael Shields in Zurich; editing by Sunil Nair and Jason Neely\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-01-18T14:38:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-18T12:29:22.001+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
