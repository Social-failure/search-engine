SmartEstimates give greater weight to recent estimates by the more consistently accurate analysts.\n“The revenue exceeded expectations; this means sales were good even considering won-dollar exchange rates. The home appliances business appears to have increased its costs, such as marketing costs, to increase sales during the peak shopping season as LG did in the same quarters in previous years,” said John Park, analyst at Daishin Securities.\nFourth-quarter forecasts for the TV business remains solid on sales of organic light-emitting diode (OLED) and other high-end TV sets after the business set a quarterly record in the previous quarter, two analysts said.\nThe firm did not disclose further details of October-December operations, and will announce full results at the end of January.\nSouth Korean exporters like LG Electronics are keeping a close eye on the won KRW=KFTC , as it hit a three-year high of around 1,058.8 per dollar on Monday, before reversing direction on what appeared to be South Korean foreign exchange authorities buying dollars.\n($1 = 1,068.1000 won)\nReporting by Joyce Lee; Editing by Muralikumar Anantharaman\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-01-08T14:27:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-08T14:09:59.007+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
