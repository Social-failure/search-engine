I therefore expect nothing less than immediate compliance,” Moyo said in a statement.\nThe Petroleum Marketers Association of Zimbabwe was not immediately available for comment.\nMoyo, however, said fuel prices would not remain fixed but would float in tandem with international prices.\nMotorists in landlocked Zimbabwe pay some of the highest fuel prices in the southern African region.
