The four last-placed teams are relegated to League B.

It’s better than the friendly games we have sometimes. \n“I‘m really happy.” Factbox - UEFA Nations League: how it works \nPoland coach Adam Nawalka agreed. “It’s a very good idea to have this competition instead of friendlies, we have a very interesting group with the European champions Portugal and four-times world champions Italy,” he told Reuters. \nPortugal coach Fernando Santos told UEFA’s website: ”One of the positives with this competition is more games between teams of a similar standard. \n“Some countries knew they will always struggle to get to a World Cup or a EURO, and they will now have another reason to invest in grassroots development and, of course, all European football will benefit from that.” Writing by Brian Homewood; Editing by Christian Radnedge and David Goodman", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-24T14:28:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-24T14:46:19.035+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
