Guaranteed minimum sugar prices also ended.\nOne impact of EU market liberalisation is that EU sugar prices are linked to world prices, which are currently weak.\n”Since the beginning of the new sugar marketing year in October 2017, sales revenues for both EU and export (sugar) volumes have declined significantly,” Suedzucker said.\n“Higher export volumes since October partially compensated for the decline and as a result the third quarter operating result remained slightly above last year’s.”\nSuedzucker’s third quarter operating earnings from sugar rose 1.9 percent to 38 million euros, sugar sales rose 9.2 percent to 831 million euros.\nSuedzucker said its new sugar harvest is looking good. It expects to produce about 5.7 million tonnes of sugar in the harvest and production season this winter, up from 4.4 million tonnes last season.\n$1 = 0.8370 euros Reporting by Michael Hogan; Editing by Maria Sheahan and Susan Fenton\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-01-11T15:55:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-12T18:23:02.034+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
