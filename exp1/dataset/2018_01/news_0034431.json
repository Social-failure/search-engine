Our actions were all in service of the user.”\nAn Apple spokeswoman declined to comment beyond Cook’s remarks or say when the update would be available to consumers.\nApple confirmed on Dec. 20 that software in iPhone 6, iPhone 6s and iPhone SE models to deal with dangers from ageing batteries could slow down the phone’s performance. Within days, Apple faced lawsuits over the phone slowing.\nThe issue struck a nerve on social media, where many voiced a theory that Apple intentionally slows down older phones to encourage customers to buy new ones. No credible evidence has emerged that Apple has ever done so. On Dec. 28, Apple issued a public apology to customers over the battery issue and said it has never purposely shortened the life of its products.\nApple also lowered the price of battery replacements for affected models from $79 to $29. The lower price could prod many consumers to replace their battery instead of buying a new phone, which in turn could lead to lower iPhone sales for 2018, Barclays analysts said in a note earlier this month.\nReporting by Stephen Nellis; Editing by Susan Thomas\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-19T00:23:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-19T00:43:39.001+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
