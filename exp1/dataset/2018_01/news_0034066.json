The action aimed “to put the scene under control,” the prosecution said in a court document on Monday. \nThe former British colony has been governed under a “One Country, Two Systems” arrangement after it returned to Chinese rule in 1997. \nBut democracy activists say Beijing is increasingly interfering with the city’s autonomy, while pro-government figures urge more respect for Beijing’s authority. \nWhen a months-long “Occupy” street occupation failed to wrestle more democratic rights from Beijing’s Communist Party rulers in 2014, a generation of young activists began pushing for outright independence, a red line for China. \nChinese and Hong Kong authorities have repeatedly condemned the movement, citing the city’s mini-constitution, the “Basic Law”, which says it is “an inalienable part” of China. \nThe nascent movement peaked in early 2016, when Leung, then a philosophy student at the University of Hong Kong, lost his bid for a seat in the city’s legislature by-election but secured a surprising 15 percent of votes. \nBut it lost steam after Leung was barred from running again, his two allies who won legislature seats were disqualified over the manner in which they took their oaths, and several protesters were jailed for rioting.
