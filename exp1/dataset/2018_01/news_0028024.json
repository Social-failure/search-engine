Both the League and Brothers of Italy want an orderly break-up of the currency union. \nAll outstanding litigation over tax matters would stop, and there would be an amnesty for “smaller payers who find themselves in economic difficulty”. The agency responsible for collecting overdue taxes, Equitalia, would be closed, leaving local authorities to do the job. \nAlso in the firing line is a 2012 overhaul of the pension system, made at the height of Italy’s sovereign debt crisis, which linked retirement age to life expectancy. \nThe parties promise a new welfare system, and to hike the lowest pensions. Small-denomination, interest-free bonds would be issued to firms and individuals owed money by the state. \nAll illegal immigrants would be repatriated, boat migrants would be blocked from arriving and rules on asylum would change. \nFormer prime minister Mario Monti has scolded politicians for making “irresponsible” promises in the campaign, but a survey published last week showed most Italians did not like or believe any of the pledges anyway. \nThe parties have not united behind one prime ministerial candidate, deciding instead that whoever gets the most votes chooses the premier. Salvini is campaigning hard for the post, but Berlusconi said on Thursday he would be ready to lead again if a ban on his holding public office is overturned.
