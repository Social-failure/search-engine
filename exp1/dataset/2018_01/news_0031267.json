The flanker last played for his country in the Six Nations fixture against Ireland in March. Both Haskell and the EPCR have the right to appeal the decision. \nHaskell, who has won 75 caps, can return to action on Feb. 12, eight days after England begin their Six Nations campaign against Italy. England then play Wales on Feb. 10. \nEngland head coach Eddie Jones is expected to name his squad for the defence of the Six Nations title on Thursday.
