REUTERS/Lucas Jackson/Files The S&P energy sector jumped more than 2 percent as Brent crude LCOc1 rose above $70 a barrel for the first time since December 2014, boosted by a surprise drop in U.S. production and lower crude inventories.\nThe industrial index was helped by airlines after an upbeat forecast from No. 2 U.S. carrier Delta Air Lines ( DAL.N ).\n“The unifying factor of today’s move and this whole week is a heightened confidence in the pace of economic activity. That helps explain the demand picture which has oil up at $70,” said Scott Clemons, chief investment strategist at Brown Brothers Harriman, in New York.\nAt 2:51 p.m., the Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJI rose 138.1 points, or 0.54 percent, to 25,507.23, the S&P 500 .SPX gained 13.76 points, or 0.5 percent, to 2,761.99, and the Nasdaq Composite .IXIC added 43.16 points, or 0.6 percent, to 7,196.73.\nWall Street had dropped on Wednesday, the first daily declines in 2018 following a report that China would slow U.S. government bond purchases and a report that U.S. President Donald Trump would end a key trade agreement.\nInvestors were expecting bullish quarterly earnings reports from the biggest U.S. companies and were hoping for some details on expected savings from the new federal tax code.

It also reported an upbeat quarterly profit.\nDelta helped the Dow Jones U.S. Airlines index .DJUSAR rise about 5 percent. The Dow Jones Transport index .DJT was up 2.3 percent, on track for its biggest one-day percentage gain since Nov. 29.\n“You see this continued rotation into stocks that will accelerate with the economy,” said Michael Antonelli, managing director of institutional sales trading at Robert W.
