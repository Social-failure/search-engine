In recent months however, some bankers have suggested it could be far less. \nIn the Reuters survey, Frankfurt was by far the most popular destination for the new roles, with Paris a distant second. \nStill, Paris was given a boost in November, when the European Union decided to relocate its London-based banking authority to the French capital after Britain leaves the bloc.

REUTERS/Denis Balibouse \nAnd the French government has staged a high-profile lobbying campaign to lure banks away from London. \nOn Monday, a day before the Davos summit kicked off in Davos, Macron hosted a meeting of top bankers and businessmen in Versailles to give them the hard sell on Paris. \nAmong those who attended were Lloyd Blankfein, CEO of Goldman Sachs, and Jamie Dimon, who runs J.P. Morgan. \nOne U.S. investment banker in Davos said Macron, himself a former banker with Rothschild, had made a very good impression at the Versailles dinner. \nBut the mood in Davos might best be described as wait and see. Bankers said France’s rigid labor laws and relatively high corporate taxes remained hurdles for Paris. \n“Before making any decisions, we want to see if the reforms announced by Macron are there to stay,” the U.S. banker said. \nIn the interview, Le Maire noted that two large systemic banks were already headquartered in Paris, in BNP and Societe Generale, and pointed to other strengths. \n“We have a very strong regulatory framework,” he said. “And we have taken the necessary steps to be more attractive for other financial institutions all over the world.” \n“That’s why I think that we have the best chance of becoming, tomorrow, the financial center in Europe. Not the dominant one but the most important one,” Le Maire added. \nThe French finance minister, who ran in the presidential primaries for the center-right Republican party before switching allegiances and joining Macron’s government, also touched on the issue of U.S. tax cuts, saying it would be wrong for European countries to respond with cuts of their own. \n“It would not be the right answer. The right answer to the decision taken by the United States is tax convergence within the Euroepan Union and among European member states, especially within the 19 states of the euro zone,” Le Maire said.
