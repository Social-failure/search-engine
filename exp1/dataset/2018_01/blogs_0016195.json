Blockchain, the technology underpinning popular digital currencies like bitcoin , is going to be used to build KodakOne, the company's new photo rights and royalties tracking product for digital photographers. KodakCoin will be the currency used on that platform. \nKodak shares jumped more than 60 percent Wednesday and have now tripled since the announcement. The shares were around $3.13 before the announcement was put out and were last trading above $11. \nIt is another step in the evolution of the faded American brand, once synonymous with film cartridges, paper and camera equipment. Kodak entered bankruptcy six years ago and emerged with a new focus on digital printing and packaging. But it still struggled to regain momentum. \nLike many old-line companies it has embraced cryptocurrencies and blockchain to remake its image, and time will tell whether that will stick. \nShares of Long Blockchain Corp. doubled after the beverage company changed its name from Long Island Iced Tea Corp. in December. The biotech equipment maker Bioptix got a similar boost when it changed its name to Riot Blockchain last year.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-10T17:35:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-10T17:47:32.020+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
