MORE WALKOUTS \nOn Tuesday, industrial action is also scheduled in Bavaria, home to premium carmaker BMW and engineering group Siemens, where the union is threatening to shift from short warning strikes lasting only a few hours to full-day stoppages. \nThe nationwide dispute follows a strong year of growth in Europe’s largest economy, driven by domestic demand from record numbers of German workers while borrowing costs and inflation remain low and exporters benefit from a global recovery. \nThat pattern should extend through 2018, with the Ifo economic institute last month forecasting growth of 2.6 percent for the year. \nTalks between unions and employers’ associations are set for Thursday in the southwestern state of Baden-Wuerttemberg, where Volkswagen’s Porsche, Mercedes-Benz maker Daimler and automotive suppliers including Bosch are based. \nNext door in Bavaria, negotiations will resume on Jan. 15, and to the north in North Rhine-Westphalia on Jan. 18. \nThe latter state’s sector employers’ association, Metall NRW, said the strikes risked damaging Germany industrial companies’ reputation as reliable suppliers. \n“I expect the union to take action at the negotiating table and not out in the streets,” Metall NRW director Luitwin Mallmann said in a statement. $1 = 0.8299 euros Reporting by Matthias Inverardi and Jan Schwartz; Additional reporting by Alexander Huebner and Ilona Wissenbach; Writing by Maria Sheahan; Editing by John Stonestreet", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-08T17:36:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-08T17:59:46.037+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
