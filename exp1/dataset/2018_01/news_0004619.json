Using banks to find demand should also help secure more aggressive pricing and ensure liquid trading. \nA market source told Reuters on Tuesday that the National Treasury Management Agency (NTMA) would seek to sell between 3 and 4 billion euros of the bond. \nThe agency plans to issue between 14 and 18 billion euros of long-term debt in 2018, including at least one syndicated deal. \nIreland raised over 17 billion euros on debt markets last year, facilitating early repayment of some of its loans from a 2010 international bailout while also increasing its scarce pool of debt eligible for the European Central Bank’s quantitative easing stimulus programme. \nThe NTMA has over the last three years taken advantage of record low funding rates and an economy that has grown faster than any other in Europe to lengthen the maturity of its stock of debt. \nIreland received its second credit rating upgrade in the three months since it last tapped investors when Fitch lifted its sovereign rating to A+ in December. \nCiti, Danske Bank, Davy Stockbrokers, J.P. Morgan, Morgan Stanley and Nomura are joint lead managers for the syndicated bond.
