Only three percent of the city’s more-than 300 metro stations are fully accessible to individuals with reduced mobility. \nThe senators’ worries add to those expressed by the Cour des Comptes, France’s independent audit body, which on Jan. 16 estimated the projects’ overall cost at 38.5 billion euros, more than 12 billion euros higher than the last estimate of 2013. \nThe audit body too said it had “serious doubts” about the project’s ability to open in time for the 2024 games. \n“We have six and a half years until the games. This may seem a comfortable gap but in reality it is very short given the slow pace and complexities of our urban procedures,” said senator Philippe Bas.
