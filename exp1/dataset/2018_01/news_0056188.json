Although it is expected to positively impact the Company’s future after-tax earnings, the reduction in the federal corporate tax rate negatively impacted the Company’s fourth quarter 2017 results.\nThe revaluation of the deferred tax asset and liabilities resulted in a one-time non-cash charge to the income statement of approximately $2.6 million, which reduced the Company’s fourth quarter 2017 results by approximately $0.52 per share-diluted. However, as a result of the revised federal corporate income tax rates effective for 2018, and changes or limits for certain tax deductions, the Company expects its effective combined federal and state income tax rate for 2018 will range between 14% and 15%. Of the $2.6 million non-cash charge, $1.6 million is related to the market valuation of available for sale securities. The FASB has issued an exposure draft, that if adopted, would require the reclassification from other comprehensive income to retained earnings in an amount equal to the non-cash charge related to available for sale securities, thereby minimizing the impact on regulatory capital.\nAfter the deferred tax adjustment, the Company incurred a net loss for the three months ended December 31, 2017 of $1.125 million, or $0.23 per share-basic and diluted, down from a net income of $1.679 million, or $0.34 per share-basic and diluted for the same quarter in 2016. Had the accounting rules not required this revaluation of deferred taxes, net income for the quarter would have been $1.434 million or $0.29 per share-basic and diluted for the three months ended December 31, 2017.\nNet interest income for the fourth quarter of 2017, after the provision for loan losses, was $7.080 million, approximately 5.0% higher than the same period in 2016. The provision for loan losses for the three months ended December 31, 2017 was negative $288 thousand compared to a negative $162 thousand for the same period in 2016. The increase in the negative provision reflects management’s estimate of inherent losses in the loan portfolio including the impact of current local and national economic conditions and partially offset by an increase in total loans outstanding. The net interest margin was 2.98% for both the fourth quarter of 2017 and 2016.\nNon-interest income increased in the fourth quarter of 2017 by $214 thousand, or 11.4%, while non-interest expenses increased $698 thousand, or 10.5%, compared to the same period in 2016. The increase in non-interest income was mainly the result of an increase in service charges on checking accounts and other service charges and fees. Non-interest expense increased due to an increase in salary and benefit expense of $262 thousand, occupancy expense of $159 thousand and a $277 thousand increase in other operating expenses. The increase in other non-interest expense was due mainly to loan collection and repossession expense for the fourth quarter.\nNet income for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017 decreased 45.0% to $3.703 million, or $0.76 per share-basic and diluted, from $6.737 million, or $1.38 per share-basic and diluted, for the twelve months ended December 31, 2016. Had the accounting rules not required this revaluation of deferred taxes, net income for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017 would have been $6.288 million or $1.29 per share-basic and diluted.\nNet interest income for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017, after the provision for loan losses, increased 2.1% to $27.728 million from $27.149 million for the same period in 2016. Net interest margin for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017, decreased to 3.01% in 2017 from 3.07% in the same period in 2016. The provision for loan losses for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017 was a negative $543 thousand compared to a negative $65 thousand in 2016. The increase in the negative provision reflects management’s assessment of inherent losses in the loan portfolio including the impact caused by current local and national economic conditions partially offset by an increase in loans outstanding.\nNon-interest income increased by $595 thousand, or 7.7%, and non-interest expense increased by $1.749 million, or 6.6%, for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017 when compared to the same period in 2016. The increase in non-interest income was the result of increases in service charges on deposit accounts and other service charges and fees. Non-interest expense increased primarily due to an increase in salary and benefits costs related to additional loan personnel.\nTotal assets as of December 31, 2017 decreased to $993.096 million, down $32.118 million, or 3.1%, when compared to December 31, 2016. Deposits decreased by $39.470 million, or 5.2%, and loans, net of unearned income, increased by $11.359 million, or 2.9%, when compared to December 31, 2016. The increase in loans, net of unearned income, was due to new loan demand in excess of loan payments. Non-performing assets decreased by $1.159 million to $12.369 million at December 31, 2017 as compared to $13.528 million at December 31, 2016, due in large part to decreases in other real estate owned and in non-accrual loans partially offset by a slight increase in loans 90 days or more past due and still accruing interest.\nDuring the twelve months of 2017, the Company paid dividends totaling $0.96 per share.\nCitizens Holding Company (the “Company”) is a one-bank holding company and the parent company of The Citizens Bank of Philadelphia (the “Bank”), both headquartered in Philadelphia, Mississippi.
