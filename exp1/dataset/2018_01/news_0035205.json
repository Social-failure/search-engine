He said the measure was “modified at the request of some of the Democrats of the Senate,” indicating it could be a compromise proposal.\nHe did not provide details.\nReporting by Richard Cowan; Editing by Peter Cooney\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-01-22T07:24:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-22T06:04:58.013+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
