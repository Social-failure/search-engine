I couldn’t sleep. I had pain everywhere,“ she told reporters. ”But I slept before the match two hours and it worked perfect. I was, like, fresh after that. I felt good. \n“Ankle is still sore. But, you know, I‘m not thinking about that any more.” \nHaving battled through three hours and 44 minutes of graft against American Davis, the 79-minute workout against Osaka was a holiday by comparison as the Romanian continues her bid for a maiden grand slam title. Tennis - Australian Open - Margaret Court Arena, Melbourne, Australia, January 22, 2018. Simona Halep of Romania celebrates winning against Naomi Osaka of Japan. REUTERS/Thomas Peter \nShe was under immense pressure in the opening stages against Osaka, however, as her 72nd-ranked opponent blazed away to set up numerous break points. \nHalep displayed her usual resilience to save four of them in an intense game at 2-3 that featured six deuces, and it proved to be a turning point. Slideshow (15 Images) \nShe began to feed off Osaka’s errors and broke twice on her way to taking the opener as the storm on the other side of the net blew itself out. \nOsaka’s spirit ebbed away in the second set and after establishing a 5-2 lead, Halep crunched a forehand return winner to seal victory and reach the last eight for the third time. \n”Actually I didn’t expect to do quarter-finals,“ Halep added. ”I didn’t expect also to stop (playing) the tournament, even if I was injured. I had nothing clear in my head. I just went on court, take (it) match by match. \n“The match against Davis was huge for me, maybe gave me a little bit more confidence that my body is okay and I can resist to the tough matches. Now I‘m more confident.” \nHalep will meet the winner of all-Czech fourth-round clash between Barbora Strycova and Karolina Pliskova as she bids for a maiden semi-final at Melbourne Park.
