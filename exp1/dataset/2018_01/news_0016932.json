And the proportion of doctors taking at least as many Medicaid as privately insured patients climbed almost 6 percentage points to about 56 percent. \nPlus, the proportion of pediatricians not accepting any Medicaid patients dropped 2 percentage points to less than 15 percent. \nOne limitation of the study is that it relied on physicians to accurately recall and report the proportion of Medicaid patients they accepted, the authors note. The study also focused on pediatricians in private practice, not at community clinics or safety net facilities. \nEven so, the results offer fresh evidence that payment increases can work as intended, particularly in getting physicans who accept Medicaid to take on more patients with this type of coverage, said Judith Solomon, vice president for health policy at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities in Washington, D.C. \n“That’s important, because even if new providers didn’t sign up because the increase was only for two years, others who were already participating increased and/or maintained their level of participation, which is important for access,” Solomon, who wasn’t involved in the study, said by email. \n“It suggests that increasing payment rates increases participation defined broadly to include the degree of participation of providers already taking patients,” Solomon added. “Having the participation of a broad array of doctors including those in private practice is important so kids can get care when they need it and that they can have an ongoing relationship with a pediatrician.” \nThe study also suggests that any reduction in payments associated with proposed cuts to the Children Health Insurance Program (CHIP), which operates in tandem with Medicaid in most states, could mean less access to care, said Brendan Saloner, a researcher at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health in Baltimore. \n“If CHIP funding runs out - and that seems to be what is happening as of this month in many states - that will lead children to be dropped from the program and will cause many pediatricians to rethink whether to participate in CHIP, since they will not have assurance that the bills will continue to get paid,” Saloner, who wasn’t involved in the study, said by email. \nSOURCE: bit.ly/2D8FKYA Pediatrics, online December 22, 2017.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-12T23:45:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-12T23:56:01.023+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
