Average hourly earnings rose 0.3 percent and the upward revisions to last month take some of the sting out of the miss against consensus in December,” said Thomas Simons, money market economist at Jefferies in New York.\nThe U.S. Labor Department said non-farm payrolls increased by 148,000 jobs in December, versus a forecast of 190,000 by economists surveyed by Reuters. That was a drop on the revised 252,000 increase in November.\nWorld stocks markets on Friday had edged higher before the jobs numbers and were on course for their strongest week in more than a year after several benchmarks broke record highs. With the world’s largest economies all growing healthily at once and central banks moving slowly to tighten policy, investors have poured money into risk assets.
