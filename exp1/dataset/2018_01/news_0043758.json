Like many of its domestic rivals, Dr Reddy’s has also been hit by U.S. bans on Indian plants over quality control issues. \nNet profit fell 38.5 percent to 3.03 billion rupees ($47.7 million) in the third quarter ended Dec. 31, below an average analyst estimate of 3.4 billion rupees. \nRevenue from the company’s generics business in North America fell 3 percent to 16.07 billion rupees. \nRevenue from its Europe generics business dropped 7 percent to 2.01 billion rupees due to pricing pressures and temporary disruptions in supply. \nDr. Reddy’s shares fell as much as 3.5 percent to 2,469 rupees in a broader Mumbai market that was trading down 0.3 percent.
