There is unemployment in the U.S., there are people who don’t have healthcare services,” Duarte told reporters.\nShe added: “We would not deign to make comments as derogatory as that about any country that has any kind of socioeconomic or other difficulties.”\nReporting by Ed Stoddard; Writing by Alexander Winning; Editing by Alison Williams\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-01-12T18:53:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-12T18:20:52.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
