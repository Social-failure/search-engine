U.S. vessels have conducted a series of freedom of navigation patrols in the region. \nChina “firmly opposes” efforts to use freedom of navigation as an excuse to hurt its sovereignty and urges the United States to “correct its mistakes,” Lu said. \nIn a separate statement on Saturday, China’s defence ministry said the repeated dispatch of U.S. warships to the region was “undermining regional peace and stability” and hurting bilateral relations.
