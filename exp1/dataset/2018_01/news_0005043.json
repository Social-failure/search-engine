REUTERS/Jumana El Heloueh/File Photo Shafik was seen as the most serious potential challenger to President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi in an election due early in the year, though Sisi has yet to officially announce his candidacy.\nShafik returned to Egypt from the United Arab Emirates in December after announcing his intention to run, setting off a firestorm of criticism from state-aligned media and speculation that he was being held by authorities in a Cairo hotel.\nThe 76-year-old, an ex-air force commander and former aviation minister, narrowly lost a presidential election to Muslim Brotherhood candidate Mohamed Mursi in 2012 before fleeing for the United Arab Emirates, where he has lived since.\nShafik said on Sunday that his time back in Egypt has led him to reconsider the decision.\n“My absence of more than five years perhaps distanced me from being able to very closely follow what is going on in our nation in terms of developments and achievements despite the difficulty of the conditions,” the statement said.\n“I have seen that I will not be the ideal person to lead the state’s affairs during the coming period. Thus I have decided not to run in the upcoming 2018 presidential elections.”\nReporting by Nadine Awadalla; Writing by Eric Knecht; editing by John Stonestreet\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-07T17:07:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-07T17:23:51.002+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
