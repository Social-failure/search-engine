The document, while containing no specific dollar figures, showed 50 percent of the funds going toward an \"infrastructure incentives\" grant program providing federal funds to state, local or private entities.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-31T04:45:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-31T04:44:46.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
