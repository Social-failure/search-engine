(the “Fund”), a New York Stock Exchange–listed closed-end fund trading under the symbol “DDF,” declares a monthly dividend of $0.0400 per share. The dividend is payable Jan. 26, 2018, to shareholders of record at the close of business on Jan. 12, 2018. The ex-dividend date will be Jan. 11, 2018.\nThe Fund is a diversified closed-end fund. The primary investment objective is to seek high current income; capital appreciation is a secondary objective. The Fund seeks to achieve its objectives by investing, under normal circumstances, at least 65% of its total assets in income-generating equity securities, including dividend-paying common stocks, convertible securities, preferred stocks, and other equity-related securities, which may include up to 25% in real estate investment trusts (REITs) and real estate industry operating companies. Up to 35% of the Fund's total assets may be invested in nonconvertible debt securities consisting primarily of high-yield, high-risk corporate bonds. In addition, the Fund utilizes leveraging techniques in an attempt to obtain a higher return for the Fund. There is no assurance that the Fund will achieve its investment objectives.\nThe Fund has implemented a managed distribution policy. Under the policy, the Fund is managed with a goal of generating as much of the distribution as possible from net investment income and short-term capital gains. The balance of the distribution will then come from long-term capital gains to the extent permitted, and if necessary, a return of capital. Even though the Fund may realize current year capital gains, such gains may be offset, in whole or in part, by the Fund’s capital loss carryovers from prior years. For federal income tax purposes, the effect of such capital loss carryovers is to convert (to the extent of such current year gains) what would otherwise be nontaxable returns of capital into distributions taxable as ordinary income. The use of such capital loss carryovers in this circumstance will produce no tax benefit for shareholders, and the capital loss carryovers available to offset future capital gains of the Fund will be reduced. Under the Regulated Investment Company Modernization Act of 2010, this tax effect attributable to the Fund’s capital loss carryovers (the conversion of nontaxable returns of capital into distributions taxable as ordinary income) will no longer apply to net capital losses of the Fund arising in Fund tax years beginning after Nov. 30, 2011. The actual determination of the source of the Fund's distributions can be made only at year end. Shareholders should receive written notification regarding the actual components and tax treatments of all Fund distributions for the calendar year 2017 in early 2018.\nAbout Macquarie Investment Management\nMacquarie Investment Management, a member of Macquarie Group, includes the former Delaware Investments and is a global asset manager with offices throughout the United States, Europe, Asia, and Australia.
