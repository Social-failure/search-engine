It’s been a while,” the former world number one told reporters. \n”I did have various emotions, mostly good ones. Excitement, joy, gratitude for being able to have an opportunity to compete. Not a while ago, about three weeks ago, I didn’t know whether I‘m going to play Australia or not. \n“The first two sets went extremely well, considering that I haven’t played for six months. The third was, you know, up and down a little bit, but in general was a great performance.” \nAlong with the addition of Andre Agassi to his coaching team, Djokovic also introduced a new service action to allow for his elbow injury.

I‘m very happy with the second serve. First serve was kind of up and down,” he said.

You think, ‘Wow’. \n”All in all, I‘m quite pleased. \n”I know that it’s going to take a little bit of time for me to kind of work my way in and get used to the specific changes that I’ve made in my service motion. \n“It wasn’t ideal, but it was still good.” \nThe 12-times grand slam champion will face a huge step up in class in the next round, against Frenchman Gael Monfils, a quarter-finalist at Melbourne Park in 2016.
