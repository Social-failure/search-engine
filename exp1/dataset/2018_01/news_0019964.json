But it could sting exporters and farmers longer term since the United States is Canada’s biggest wheat, hog and cattle export market.\nThe country’s energy industry does not expect tariffs to be imposed on oil and gas exports, said Nick Schultz of the Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers, given that would amount to an additional cost to U.S. refiners, which import 3 million barrels a day of Canadian crude.\nReporting by Alastair Sharp, Susan Taylor and Fergal Smith in Toronto, and Nia Williams and Rod Nickel in Calgary; Editing by Sandra Maler\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-01-12T06:55:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-12T18:41:48.005+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
