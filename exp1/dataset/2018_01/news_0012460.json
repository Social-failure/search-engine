U.S. Commercial crude inventories <C-STK-T-EIA> fell by 7.4 million barrels in the week to Dec. 29, to 424.46 million barrels, according to data from the Energy Information Administration (EIA).\nThat's down 20 percent from their historic peaks last March and close to the five-year average of 420 million barrels.\nCAN THE BULL-RUN LAST?\nGiven that Iran's oil production has not been affected by the unrest, and that U.S. production <C-OUT-T-EIA> will likely break through 10 million barrels per day (bpd) soon, a level so far only reached by Saudi Arabia and Russia, doubts are emerging whether the bull-run can last.\n\"Prices above $60 per barrel project an overly rosy picture, so we see near-term downside,\" Ruecker warned.\n\"Oil production disruptions (in Iran) remain a very distant threat ... Disruptions in the North Sea have been removed with the Forties Pipeline system having resumed full operations. U.S. oil production surpassed the 2015 highs in October and is set to climb to historic highs this year,\" he said.\nLukman Otunuga, analyst at futures brokerage FXTM, struck a similarly cautious tone.\n\"Oil started the New Year on an incredibly bullish note ... in part due to ongoing tensions in Iran ... (and) over OPEC's supply cut rebalancing the markets,\" he said.\n\"While the current momentum suggests that further upside is on the cards, it must be kept in mind that U.S. shale remains a threat to higher oil prices.\"\n(Reporting by Henning Gloystein; Editing by Richard Pullin)", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-05T03:53:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-05T05:45:50.005+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
