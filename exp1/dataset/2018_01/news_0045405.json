The government strongly rejects this. \nZoltan Osztie, the priest of the Budapest church, said the church had a tradition of organising a mass for Horthy each year and nobody had noticed that Saturday was also International Holocaust Remembrance marking the day in 1945 when the Auschwitz-Birkenau death camp was liberated. \n“We could be blamed for this perhaps, but these two events can not be juxtaposed. Nonetheless, after discussion with church leaders a decision has been made that neither the memorial ceremony nor the mass will take place,” he told szemlelek.blog.hu. \nWJC President Ronald S. Lauder asked Orban to intervene, calling the event “nothing short of a provocative measure.” \n“The terror that Admiral Horthy, an unabashed anti-Semite, inflicted on the Jewish community of Hungary ... and his role in the deportation and murder of hundreds of thousands of Jews, must never be forgotten and can never be excused,” Lauder wrote in a letter to Orban. \nThe government did not reply to Reuters questions. \nSandor Lezsak, deputy parliament speaker and a member of Fidesz party, had been due to speak at the ceremony, stirring protests from the Hungarian Jewish communities federation. \nAfter Hungary’s occupation by Germany in March 1944, still under Horthy’s rule, Hungarian gendarmes and state organisations collaborated in the deportation of close to half a million Jews. Horthy stopped the deportations only in July 1944.
