We emphasise the authority’s obligation to question unusually low prices according to the European Union law on public procurement,” Strabag told Reuters.\nA third bidder for the project was a consortium comprising Italy’s Astaldi and Turkey’s IC Ictas, which offered to carry our the works for 2.5 billion kuna. Strabag’s offer was the highest and amounted to 2.6 billion kuna.\nCroatia’s daily Novi List reported on Tuesday that the Astaldi consortium had also filed a complaint. Astaldi was not immediately available for comment.\nThe European Commission agreed last June to fund 85 percent of the project, with Croatia providing the rest.\nCroatia, an EU member since 2013, sees the project and the resulting territorial continuity as necessary to enter the EU’s Schengen zone, where passport checks are not required.\nAt the moment, the only road connection between mainland Croatia and its far south - including the popular tourist destination of Dubrovnik - passes through neighbouring Bosnia.\n$1 = 6.1402 kuna Reporting by Igor Ilic; Editing by Mark Potter\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-01-24T00:04:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-24T15:55:03.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
