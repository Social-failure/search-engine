There were $1.5 billion worth of outstanding Global 2047 bonds at the end of November. \nThe government initially suggested a price for the reopening that would yield around 5.80 percent, according to Thomson Reuters debt service IFR. \nThe transaction comes a week after Standard & Poor’s widely expected downgrade of Brazil’s sovereign credit rating. \nThe cost of insuring against a Brazilian sovereign default held near four-year lows after the downgrade, though it remains close to that of lower-rated peers. \nBrazilian foreign debt totaled 121.4 billion reais ($37.9 billion) in November, dwarfed by its 3.37 trillion reais worth of local currency debt. $1 = 3.21 reais Reporting by Patricia Duarte; Writing by Bruno Federowski; Editing by Chizu Nomiyama and Phil Berlowitz", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-18T16:43:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-18T16:53:14.034+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
