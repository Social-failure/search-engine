The new target is 18 percent above Thursday's closing price. The stock traded at $39.67 at 10 a.m. ET.\n\"The company is in the early stages of a positive transition to software,\" Liani said. \"While the strategy shift is not new, we believe now is the right time given the added benefit of domestic capex tailwinds and tax reform.\"\nCisco shares are up more than 3.5 percent this week, building on strong gains from 2017. The stock jumped 26.7 percent last year. By comparison, the S&P 500 gained 19.4 percent in that time period.\nLiani also noted Cisco has strong free cash flow and a low valuation compared with its competitors. \"Cisco's valuation discount versus the market has consistently widened over the last 5 years and Cisco is still one of the cheapest stocks versus all large-cap tech and networking peers,\" the analyst said.\nDisclaimer", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-05T17:28:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-05T17:59:13.005+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
