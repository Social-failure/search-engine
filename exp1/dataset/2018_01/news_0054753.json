Those bigger updates reportedly included a new home screen design, revised interfaces for Apple’s CarPlay in-car software, and a variety of tweaks to built-in apps, like Mail, the report said. \nApple each year releases software updates to its many operating systems, including macOS, iOS, watchOS, and tvOS. Some years, those updates offer major design overhauls and dramatic changes to built-in applications. In other years, Apple delivers only minor tweaks to improve performance. \nGet Data Sheet , Fortune’s technology newsletter \nThe tech giant’s reported decision to focus more on reliability this year comes after the company has faced months of backlash over a variety of problems in iOS . Chief among them is a software update that attempted to improve battery performance in iPhones but also caused the handset’s processor performance to degrade, resulting in poor app responsiveness. \nApple has said that the feature is necessary to ensure iPhones won’t shut down spontaneously when batteries start to degrade, but users have continued to speak out. Apple ultimately decided to allow users to turn off the “processor throttling” feature on their iPhones. \nDespite planning to delay some of the bigger updates to 2019, Apple’s iOS 12 won’t offer only under-the-hood improvements, according to the report. Apple is still planning to deliver new parental controls and health-tracking features, according to the Axios sources. The company might also offer some new augmented reality features that improve the iPhone’s interaction with real-world objects. \nApple did not immediately respond to a Fortune request for comment on the Axios report.
