The KRG took control of the Kirkuk region in 2014, when the Iraqi army collapsed in the face of Islamic State’s sweeping advance in northern and western Iraq. \nThe Kurdish move prevented the fields from falling into the hands of the militants. \nKirkuk is one of the biggest and oldest oilfields in the Middle East, estimated to contain about 9 billion barrels of recoverable oil, according to BP. \nBP has provided technical assistance in the past to the North Oil to aid the redevelopment of the Kirkuk field. \nIraq is the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries’ second-largest producer behind Saudi Arabia. \nLuaibi said on Saturday that Iraq oil output capacity is nearing 5 million bpd. However, it is currently producing 4.4 million bpd in compliance with an agreement between oil exporters to support crude prices.
