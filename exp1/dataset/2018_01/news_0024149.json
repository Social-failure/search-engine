Ginobili suffered a right thigh contusion early in the game, went to the locker room and did not return.\nThe Spurs led 73-72 heading into the fourth quarter, setting the stage for a tense finish. Schroder scored four straight points to give the Hawks an 89-82 lead with six minutes left. He had 12 points in the fourth quarter.\nAldridge started hot, scoring nine early points and leading the Spurs out to an 18-4 lead. Atlanta endured the early San Antonio surge and answered back with a 17-5 run to close out the first quarter.\nThe Spurs led 48-44 at halftime.\nErsan Ilyasova added 20 points for the Hawks, and Dewayne Dedmon made a big impact off the bench with 12 points and 10 rebounds.\nAtlanta outrebounded San Antonio 50-37 and made 13 of 14 free throws.\nThe Spurs finish their three-game road trip at Brooklyn on Wednesday and at Toronto on Friday.\nThe Hawks entered the game having lost five of six, but moved to 1-1 through two games of a six-game homestand with the win over the Spurs.
