Under Ng, Baidu released a voice-based operating system that users can talk to - much like Amazon’s Alexa voice assistant or Apple’s Siri - and also started working on self-driving cars and face recognition technology to open things like transit turnstiles when users approach.\n“Based on that experience, I have an unusual point of view on the building of AI businesses. I think it’s a more systematic, repeatable process than most people think,” said Ng, who also taught artificial intelligence courses at Stanford University.\nThe first company to receive money from the fund will be Landing.ai, a company Ng founded. Landing.ai is working with Hon Hai Precision Industry Co Ltd, better known as electronics assembler Foxconn, on using artificial intelligence to make factories more efficient.\nIn many factories, workers look over parts coming off an assembly line for defects. In Landing.ai’s system, workers instead put a circuit board beneath a digital camera connected to a computer and the computer identifies any defects. The system can be trained with as few as five images, which the company says is fewer than its competitors.\nNg, who also co-founded online learning site Coursera, said he is also working on new tools for training workers whose jobs are in danger from artificial intelligence, though he said Landing.ai was not displacing visual inspectors.\n“When you go to Japan, there is such a talent shortage that the debate about AI taking jobs is almost non-existent. The debate is, how can we automate this so we can get all the work done?” Ng said.
