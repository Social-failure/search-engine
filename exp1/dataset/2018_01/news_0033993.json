Each would vest only if a set of two milestones are achieved, one based on market value, the other on a measure of revenue or profit. For each tranche achieved, Musk would receive shares equal to 1% of the company’s total shares outstanding as of Jan. 21, 2018. \nFor example, the first tranche would vest if Tesla hits $100 billion in market value and $20 billion in revenue or $1.5 billion in earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, after adjusting for stock compensation. For all 12 tranches to vest, Tesla’s market value would have to reach $650 billion.
