University of Illinois Police/Handout via REUTERS Prior to her disappearance, Zhang was recorded on surveillance video on June 9 waiting for a bus. She was seen getting into a black car that police later connected to Christensen.\nAfter federal agents put him under surveillance, he was heard “explaining” he had kidnapped her, according to court filings.\nIn October, the Justice Department filed a new, superseding indictment against him saying the kidnapping directly resulted in her death.\nHe is also charged with making false statements to the FBI, after he told them he had picked her up in his car and dropped her off.\nReporting by Sarah N.
