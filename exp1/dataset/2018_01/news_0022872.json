(NYSE: SRC) (\"Spirit\" or the \"Company\") announced today that it has funded $35 million (the \"B-1 Term Loan\") into an existing credit facility (\"Term B Loan\") of Shopko Stores Operating Co., LLC and its affiliates (\"Shopko\"), and concurrently entered into an amendment to Shopko's Master Lease. The Term B Loan facility is part of Shopko's $784 million asset backed lending facility and shares the collateral.\nThe Master Lease amendment requires Shopko to provide to Spirit annual and quarterly financial statements that are compliant with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the \"SEC\") rules. Further, the amendment modifies certain provisions of the Master Lease including provisions related to assignment by Tenant, subletting by Tenant, sale by Landlord and rent payment date, and specifies a maximum three-month deferred non-consecutive rent period with associated interest charges. Spirit's B-1 Term Loan bears interest at a rate of 12% per annum, and along with the existing Term B Loan, matures in 2020 and is secured by Shopko's assets in their $784 million asset backed lending facility.\n\"We are very pleased with the outcome of our continued conversations with the team at Shopko as we seek to maximize the value of our Shopko assets,\" stated Jackson Hsieh, President and Chief Executive Officer of Spirit. \"As Shopko has executed on their strategy to improve operations, which resulted in strong results for the important holiday season, we reached an agreement to join their existing lender group and provided Shopko $35 million for a two year term at a rate that we believe provides an attractive return for Spirit shareholders. In exchange, we amended our Master Lease to define a limited rent deferral period, which maintains our rental rate while providing Shopko with incremental flexibility, and most importantly, to gain access to quarterly and audited annual financial statements from Shopko, which we believe provides immediate, significant incremental visibility and over the long term, far greater optionality with respect to our ability to transact that portfolio. Our previously announced spin-off transaction was not dependent upon Spirit amending the Master Lease or funding the term loan.\"\nOn January 16, 2018, Spirit received a letter from Shopko providing an update on Shopko's select financial results. For the nine week holiday period ended December 30, 2017, EBITDA grew by 18%, Main Store Gross Margins improved by over 250 basis points and comp Main Store Sales (excluding the impact of lower clearance sales) were down by 0.7%, in each case, compared to the corresponding period in the prior year. A copy of the letter has been posted to the investor relations section of Spirit's website.\nAbout Spirit Realty Capital\nSpirit Realty Capital, Inc.
