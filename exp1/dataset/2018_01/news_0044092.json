Tensions escalated dramatically last year as the regime of Kim Jong Un stepped up its programme aimed at developing a nuclear-tipped missile capable of striking the United States.

REUTERS/Fabrizio Bensch PEACE OR PROPAGANDA? \nSome South Korean opposition politicians and conservatives have criticized Pyongyang’s participation in the Pyeongchang Games, saying Kim was using North Korea’s involvement for his own purposes. \nMany other South Korea welcomed the North’s participation, but complained that the unified women’s ice hockey team - the only such joint team to be formed - was unfair to the players. Slideshow (2 Images) \nThe controversy has sent South Korean President Moon Jae-in’s overall approval rating below 60 percent for the first time since he took office in may last year, according to a survey released on Thursday by South Korean pollster Realmeter, dropping more than 6 percent since last week. \nU.S. Vice President Mike Pence plans to use his attendance at the Games to try to counter what he sees as Kim’s efforts to “hijack” the games with a propaganda campaign, a White House official said on Tuesday. \nWashington has been driving a tightening of sanctions on isolated North Korea and on Wednesday imposed fresh sanctions on nine entities, 16 people and six North Korean ships. It also urged China and Russia, North Korea’s main allies, to expel North Koreans raising funds for the programmes. \nThe South Korean government has rejected criticism that the games had been hijacked by North Korea, saying the event will help defuse tensions over Pyongyang’s nuclear and missile programme. \nMilitary tension on the Korean peninsula was a “fundamental obstacle” for the improvement of inter-Korean relations and unification, the North’s official news agency said in its statement on Thursday. \nIt added joint military drills with “outside forces” were unhelpful for the development of relations between North and South Korea. \nSouth Korea successfully pressed the United States to delay large-scale annual drills involving the two countries troops until after the Olympics, but Washington officials have rejected the idea of a permanent halt to the exercises in exchange for North Korea freezing its missile and nuclear weapons tests. \nThe proposal to delay the exercise was based on the “spirit of the Olympic Games”, Foreign Minister Kang said, declining to elaborate on whether the South would resume the drills after the event.
