REUTERS/Simon Dawson \nA tweak to the Bank of Japan’s bond-buying programme shunted the yen higher, while the dollar climbed against a basket of major currencies, recovering further from last week’s decline to its lowest in more than three months. \nWall Street’s main indexes hit record highs at the open, extending a winning streak since the start of 2018. MSCI’s all-country world stocks index also posted another record high. \nU.S. stock investors remain upbeat about fourth-quarter earnings season, which begins on Friday with results from JPMorgan Chase ( JPM.N ), with the focus expected to be on any comments related to the just-approved U.S. tax overhaul that includes hefty corporate tax cuts. \nCiti analysts say global earnings revisions have now been upgraded for 14 weeks in a row, the best run of weekly upgrades since their data series started in 2000. \n“Across the board, we’re positive about fourth quarter and the next few quarters. But it could be a little bit noisy after we got the tax reform law passed and companies make some adjustments close to year-end,” said Tim Dreiling, regional investment director for The Private Client Reserve of U.S. Bank. \nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJI rose 115.62 points, or 0.46 percent, to 25,398.62, the S&P 500 .SPX gained 8.11 points, or 0.30 percent, to 2,755.82 and the Nasdaq Composite .IXIC added 11.77 points, or 0.16 percent, to 7,169.15. \nThe S&P 500 has been up every day so far in the new year, providing more optimism on the outlook for the rest of the year.
