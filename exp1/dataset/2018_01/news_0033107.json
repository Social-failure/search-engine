The United Nations considers solitary over 15 days to be torture. \nBritish Columbia Supreme Court Judge Peter Leask found that the laws governing administrative segregation in Canada’s federal prisons contravene the country’s Charter of Rights and Freedoms. \nThe ruling gives the federal government a year to bring its laws in line with the Charter. Canada’s Public Safety Minister Ralph Goodale, who oversees the federal prison system, said in a statement the government is reviewing the ruling. \nGoodale said Ottawa has already introduced legislation that would limit the amount of time someone can be held in solitary confinement. \nThe British Columbia Civil Liberties Association (BCCLA), which brought the case, said the ruling is a victory. \n“It’s an incredible decision,” BCCLA lawyer Jay Aubrey said, adding she hopes the government rewrites its laws to prohibit the use of solitary confinement for youth and people with mental illness and to cap the length of solitary confinement at 15 days. \nShe said the government should also take steps to address the over-representation of indigenous inmates, particularly indigenous women, in solitary confinement. \nThe law currently caps solitary for disciplinary reasons at 30 days. The vast majority of people in solitary confinement in Canada are under administrative, not disciplinary, segregation.
