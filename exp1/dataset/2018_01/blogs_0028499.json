It is expected to give Uber a leg up in its battle for market share with Grab, Southeast Asia’s dominant ride-hailing player.\nGrab has partnered with other taxi operators in Singapore.\nComfortDelGro operated about 13,700 taxis in the city state as of November, official data shows, which is more than the fleet of all the other taxi companies combined. Uber’s Lion City Rentals has a fleet of about 14,000 vehicles.\nUberFLASH fares will be, on average, 5-10 percent cheaper than low-cost option UberX, Uber and ComfortDelGro said in a joint statement on Thursday.\nUberFLASH is already available in Thailand and Malaysia.\nComfortDelGro’s acquisition of a majority stake in Lion City is waiting for approval from the Competition Commission of Singapore. The anti-trust regulator is reviewing the deal and recently sought public feedback on it.\nReporting by Aradhana Aravindan; Editing by Himani Sarkar\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-18T10:18:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-18T10:29:53.007+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
