REUTERS/Simon Dawson \nMay, weakened by the loss of the Conservative Party’s majority in June’s election gamble, hoped to reset her agenda and further Britain’s departure from the European Union after winning a deal to move to a second phase of Brexit negotiations. \nBut by keeping her team’s ‘big beasts’ - the finance, Brexit, foreign and interior ministers, some opposition lawmakers questioned her ability to fully reassert her authority with the reshuffle after the setbacks last year. \nAfter a difficult start when her party had to delete a tweet naming the wrong person as its new chairman, May went on to promote more women, black and younger lawmakers to challenge critics who call the Conservatives “male, pale and stale”. \n“It’s an opportunity to refresh the government and just to give added impetus to the prime minister’s reform agenda while continuing to deliver on Brexit,” her spokesman said. \nDespite winning agreement from the EU to move Brexit talks to a discussion of future trade and a transitional deal, May has been criticised at home for her approach to healthcare, housing, transport and Britain’s departure from the bloc. \nHer Conservative Party is also reported to be losing members at a time when the main opposition Labour Party, under leftist leader Jeremy Corbyn, is enjoying record levels of support, suggesting to some that it is on course to win a new election due in 2022. \nTo combat this, May appointed two popular Conservatives to become the chairman and deputy chair of the party - immigration minister Brandon Lewis and lawmaker James Cleverly.

He had been trying to help officials form a power-sharing government to avoid any return to violence between pro-British unionists and Irish nationalists that scarred the province for decades. \nHe will be replaced a May loyalist, Karen Bradley. \nThe Liberal Democrats’ Alistair Carmichael said the reshuffle could be summed up as “nothing has changed”, repeating words used by May at one of the lowest points in her election campaign when she was forced to change policy over social care. \n“Theresa May wanted to reassert her authority but has come out of this looking weaker than ever,” he said in a statement.
