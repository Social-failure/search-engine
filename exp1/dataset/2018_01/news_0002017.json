It must also submit progress reports to DFS.\nWestern Union said in a statement it had previously set aside $49 million to resolve the investigation. It also said that it had made substantial improvements aimed at enhancing its compliance programs.\nAs part of a deferred prosecution agreement with the Justice Department announced in January 2017, Western Union admitted it violated U.S. laws.\nThe company also agreed in January 2017 to pay $5 million to various state attorneys general to reimburse investigative, enforcement and other costs in connection with related investigations.\nReporting by Nate Raymond in Boston; Editing by Susan Thomas\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-04T20:23:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-04T20:34:56.001+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
