Export prices for 12.5 percent protein wheat fell 5 zloty on the week to around 680 zloty a tonne for delivery to port silos in January.\n“Feed mills are at the same level as millers due to good demand for feed wheat and a lack of sales offers,” one Polish trader said.\n“Poland’s wheat exports are still slow and are running at only about 50 percent of the level we saw last season partly because of the strong local currency and the poor crop last summer,” he said.\n“Polish wheat prices are some of the highest in Europe and port loadings are currently very quiet.”\nPrices at 1733 GMT\nLast Change Pct End Ytd\nMove 2016 Pct\nMove\nParis wheat Mar 155.75 -1.50 -0.95 177.50 -12.25\nParis maize Jan 154.50 -1.00 -0.64 166.00 -6.93\nParis rape Feb 350.75 -2.00 -0.57 380.25 -7.76\nCBOT wheat Mar Closed\nCBOT corn Mar Closed\nCBOT soy Mar Closed\nWTI crude oil 64.61 0.31 0.48 53.72 20.27\nEuro/dlr 1.23 0.01 0.66\nMost active contracts - Wheat, corn and soy US cents/bushel,\nParis futures in euros per tonne\nReporting by Valerie Parent in Paris and Michael Hogan in Hamburg; writing by Sybille de La Hamaide; editing by Mark Heinrich\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-01-16T02:19:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-15T22:15:26.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
