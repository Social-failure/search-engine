HNA has also recently struggled for cash, asking some lenders to extend loans and lessors to delay due payments in several cases.\nBanks are required to periodically verify the identities of clients through KYC, the most basic of checks. Clearances for HNA on KYC from the four banks would mean they have satisfied themselves about the conglomerate’s identity and could pursue fundraisings and deals of HNA and its units, subject to other checks and requirements.\nJPMorgan, UBS, Credit Suisse and Nomura declined to comment.
