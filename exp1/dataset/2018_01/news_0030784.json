Moyo said pirate taxis had turned Harare into a “hazardous jungle.”\nIn the midst of the rainy season, the local authority fears that illegal vending of food and fruits could lead to an outbreak of cholera. Four people died this week from cholera in Chegutu town, 100 km (62 miles) west of Harare.\nReporting by MacDonald Dzirutwe, Editing by William Maclean\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-01-20T23:13:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-20T17:23:20.021+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
