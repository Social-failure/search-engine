Factbox \n“The ankle’s sore, it’s not recovered,” Halep said after the Davis marathon. \n“Osaka is hitting strong, so strong. I have to be strong, if I can, on my legs, and just stay there, playing fast, opening the court, as I do all the time.” Tennis - Australian Open - Margaret Court Arena, Melbourne, Australia, January 20, 2018.

Slideshow (2 Images) \nDjokovic, who received treatment on his lower back in his third round match and is still playing with a sleeve over the troublesome elbow that sidelined him for half a year, said he was expecting a tougher tie this time. \nDefending champion Federer, himself looking to match Djokovic’s tally of six Melbourne Park titles, will attempt to do his part to set up the blockbuster clash when he meets Hungary’s Marton Fucsovics for a place in the last eight. \nIn other action, Taiwan’s Hsieh Su-wei, who has beaten world number three Garbine Muguruza and former world number two Agnieszka Radwanska in the last two rounds, trains her giant-killer’s gaze on in-form 2016 champion Angelique Kerber. \nMadison Keys takes on eighth seed Caroline Garcia in the first match of the day on Rod Laver Arena, while Barbora Strycova and Karolina Pliskova, who fell out over a coach last year, meet in an all-Czech grudge match to close the day.
