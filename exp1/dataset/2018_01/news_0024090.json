It has debt and liabilities of 1.5 billion pounds.\nDANIEL SORABJI | AFP | Getty Images A construction crane showing the branding of British construction company Carillion is photographed on a building site in central London on January 14, 2018, with the skyline of the British capital in the background including the London Eye and the Houses of Parliament. Employing 43,000 people around the world, including 20,000 in Britain, the 200-year-old company runs public services from hospitals to train lines and ministry of defense sites.\nIt has also built construction projects such as London's Royal Opera House, the Suez Canal road tunnel and Toronto's Union Station. In July last year, it won contracts to build Britain's new High Speed 2 rail line, a major project that will better connect London with the north of England.\nTensions around Carillion have been ratcheting up for weeks, forcing the government to hold a string of crisis meetings to discuss how they should respond. Unions and the opposition Labour Party had argued that taxpayers should not bail out the failing company.\nCarillion said the government would provide the necessary funding to maintain the public services carried out by its staff, while PricewaterhouseCoopers will oversee the process.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-15T09:19:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-15T10:03:31.006+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
