Tavares, the former Renault-Nissan executive who took over the company in 2014, has outlined plans to slowly re-enter the U.S. market, starting with ride services. \nLast year, Tavares acquired GM’s European Opel operation after GM decided to divest the money-losing operation. \nTavares on Wednesday outlined a three-step process for re-establishing Peugeot in the U.S. market, the world’s second largest. \nPeugeot already is beginning to offer ride services in the United States through its Free2Move brand, using other companies’ cars. Next, Tavares said, will come ride services using Peugeot cars. The third step will be to start offering Peugeot vehicles designed with Opel engineers who worked designing vehicles for GM that were sold in the United States. \nOpel engineers can “ensure the future products for this market will be fully U.S. compliant” not just from a regulatory standpoint, but also with consumer tastes, Tavares said.
