(NYSE:REV) today announced that Fabian Garcia, President and Chief Executive Officer of Revlon, has stepped down from his position to pursue other opportunities. Paul Meister, currently a member of Revlon’s Board of Directors, will become Executive Vice Chairman of the Board, overseeing day-to-day operations of the company on an interim basis. Mr. Garcia will stay on through the end of February to assist Mr. Meister with an orderly transition of his duties.\n“It has been a privilege to serve as CEO of this iconic company,” said Fabian Garcia. “I want to thank each and every one of the women and men of Revlon whose relentless commitment and passion for the beauty business have made this company the global cosmetics leader it remains today. I also want to thank MacAndrews & Forbes for their support as we started to transform the company after the Elizabeth Arden acquisition all the way through the most recent launch of the new and exciting ‘Live Boldly’ Revlon campaign. I’m confident that Revlon will continue to succeed as the company executes its long term growth plan, which is already having an impact on reestablishing its status as a trendsetter and pioneer in the industry.”\n“This has been a difficult year for us balancing the successful integration of Elizabeth Arden with the rise of e-commerce and specialty beauty stores. We are aggressively catching up to that rapid transformation and I want to thank Fabian for his leadership through this challenging and dynamic period,” said Ronald O. Perelman, Chairman of the Revlon Board of Directors. “I look forward to continuing to realize the benefits of the Elizabeth Arden acquisition and evolving to grow in this exciting new way of business. The company has gained momentum and is now poised for future growth.”\nAdded Meister, “I’m thrilled to help lead Revlon during this transition period and I’ve been encouraged by the progress Revlon has made with respect to our extensive transformation initiatives. While we still have significant work to do, we’re putting our iconic brands at the center of our strategy to better position us in this rapidly evolving marketplace. I look forward to enhancing our operating structure, driving innovation, and strengthening the future leadership team.”\nPaul Meister has served on the Board of Directors at Revlon since 2016. He is currently President of MacAndrews & Forbes and was co-founder of Liberty Lane Partners, LLC, a private investment company with investments in healthcare, technology, and distribution-related industries. He previously served as Chairman and CEO of inVentiv Health (now Syneos Health, Inc.) and Chairman of Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc.\nResults of Operations\nIn connection with the Company’s management transition, Revlon also announced preliminary unaudited financial results for its fiscal year and fourth quarter ended December 31, 2017.\nThe Company currently estimates that net sales were approximately $785 million for the three-month period ended December 31, 2017, compared to $801 million in the fourth quarter of 2016. Full year 2017 net sales are estimated to be approximately $2.7 billion, compared to $2.3 billion in 2016. The Company estimates that its reported net loss for the fourth quarter 2017 was in a range of approximately $60 million to $80 million, compared to $36.5 million in the fourth quarter of 2016. Full year 2017 net loss is estimated to be in the range of approximately $165 million to $185 million, compared to $21.9 million in 2016. The 2017 net loss includes the expected impact of a significant non-cash charge related to the recently enacted Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (Tax Reform) and an approximate $11 million projected non-cash goodwill impairment charge, on both a pre-tax and after-tax basis, recognized in the fourth quarter of 2017 relating to the Company’s Global Color Brands reporting unit. Fourth quarter 2017 Adjusted EBITDA (a) is estimated to be between approximately $110 and $115 million, compared to $149 million in the fourth quarter of 2016. Full year 2017 Adjusted EBITDA is expected to be approximately $260 million, compared to $415 million in 2016. The Company delivered strong results on the Elizabeth Arden Integration Program, realizing approximately $70 million of synergies and cost reductions in 2017.\nCommenting on the preliminary results, Revlon’s Chief Operating Officer, Operations and Chief Financial Officer, Chris Peterson, said, “With the momentum that we generated in the fourth quarter of 2017, we are confident that the combination of our $260 million of 2017 Adjusted EBITDA, the synergies and cost reductions remaining to be captured through the Elizabeth Arden Integration, and our ongoing business initiatives provide Revlon with a stable foundation for its future success.”\nMr. Peterson continued, “Although we still have continuing improvements to make, we’re encouraged by our fourth quarter results, which represent a sequential improvement from the first nine months of the year. Our liquidity position has strengthened, and Revlon color cosmetics returned to growth in North America. The sector is experiencing a profound shift, but we’re gaining momentum on our strategy to respond to the accelerating pace of innovation and increasing migration to digitally-focused consumer engagement. We’re also pleased with our continued growth in e-commerce and look forward to expanding our share of this important category.”\nMr. Peterson added, “Contrary to false rumors and pure speculation in public reports, a material asset transfer is not being considered.”\nThese preliminary unaudited results are derived from preliminary internal financial reports and are subject to revision based on the Company's financial closing procedures and controls associated with the completion of its year-end financial reporting, including all customary reviews and approvals, and completion by the Company's independent registered public accounting firm of its audit of such financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2017. Accordingly, actual final results for 2017 may differ from these preliminary results, whether due to adjustments and other developments that may arise between the issuance of this press release and the issuance of the final audited results for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2017 or otherwise, and such differences may be material.\nRevlon intends to release actual fourth quarter and full year 2017 earnings results on March 2, 2018.\nABOUT REVLON\nRevlon has developed a long-standing reputation as a color authority and beauty trendsetter in the world of color cosmetics and hair care.

The Company defines EBITDA as income from continuing operations before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization, gains/ losses on foreign currency fluctuations, gains/losses on the early extinguishment of debt and miscellaneous expenses (the foregoing being the “EBITDA Exclusions”). The Company presents Adjusted EBITDA to exclude the impact of non-cash stock compensation expense, the EBITDA Exclusions and certain other non-operating items that are not directly attributable to the Company's underlying operating performance (the “Non-Operating Items”).\nThe Company excludes the EBITDA Exclusions and Non-Operating Items, as applicable, in calculating Adjusted EBITDA because the Company's management believes that some of these items may not occur in certain periods, the amounts recognized can vary significantly from period to period and/or these items do not facilitate an understanding of the Company's underlying operating performance.\nThe Company's management uses the Non-GAAP Measures as operating performance measures (in conjunction with GAAP financial measures) as an integral part of its reporting and planning processes and to, among other things: (i) monitor and evaluate the performance of the Company's business operations, financial performance and overall liquidity; (ii) facilitate management's internal comparisons of the Company's historical operating performance of its business operations; (iii) facilitate management's external comparisons of the results of its overall business to the historical operating performance of other companies that may have different capital structures and debt levels; (iv) review and assess the operating performance of the Company's management team and, together with other operational objectives, as a measure in evaluating employee compensation, including bonuses and other incentive compensation; (v) analyze and evaluate financial and strategic planning decisions regarding future operating investments; and (vi) plan for and prepare future annual operating budgets and determine appropriate levels of operating investments.\nManagement believes that the Non-GAAP Measures are useful to investors to provide them with disclosures of the Company's operating results on the same basis as that used by management. Management believes that Adjusted EBITDA provides useful information to investors about the performance of the Company's overall business because such measure eliminates the effects of certain charges that are not directly attributable to the Company's underlying operating performance. Additionally, management believes that providing Adjusted EBITDA enhances the comparability for investors in assessing the Company’s financial reporting.\nAccordingly, the Company believes that the presentation of the Non-GAAP Measures, when used in conjunction with GAAP financial measures, are useful financial analytical measures that are used by management, as described above, and therefore can assist investors in assessing the Company's financial condition, operating performance and underlying strength. The Non-GAAP Measures should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for their respective most directly comparable As Reported financial measure prepared in accordance with GAAP, which for Adjusted EBITDA is net income/loss. Other companies may define such non-GAAP measures differently. Also, while Adjusted EBITDA, as used in this release, is defined differently than Adjusted EBITDA for the Company's credit agreements and indentures, certain financial covenants in its borrowing arrangements are tied to similar financial measures. The Non-GAAP Measures should be read in conjunction with the Company's financial statements and related footnotes filed with the SEC.\nREVLON, INC.
