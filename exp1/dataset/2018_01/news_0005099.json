The litigation began in 2015 after the U.S. Department of Justice began probing possible collusion. It has yet to take any formal action. \nThe passenger litigation combined more than 100 private lawsuits filed around the country. \nPassengers claimed that the airlines’ collusion began in early 2009, led to higher fares and reduced flight choices, and together with low fuel prices and higher fees for checking bags and other services helped the industry post record profits. \nAccording to government data, American, Delta, Southwest and United together commanded a roughly 69 percent share of the U.S. domestic air travel market from October 2016 to September 2017. \nIn statements on Thursday, American spokesman Matt Miller said, “We will continue to defend against the claims, which we believe are without merit,” while Delta spokesman Morgan Durrant said, “The simple fact is that Delta has not engaged in any illegal behavior.” \nUnited spokeswoman Erin Benson said the airline will continue to defend against the claims, which it said are without merit. \nKollar-Kotelly called Southwest’s settlement “sufficiently fair, reasonable and adequate” to justify preliminary approval. \nFinal approvals typically occur a few months after preliminary approvals are granted and after people are given a chance to object. \nThe case is In re: Domestic Airline Travel Antitrust Litigation, U.S. District Court, District of Columbia, No. 15-mc-01404.
