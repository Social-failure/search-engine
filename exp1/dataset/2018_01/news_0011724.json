I’ve watched him practice. \n”Obviously to play best-of-five-set matches and to play seven of them in two weeks, he’d need to have a lot of things go his way. \n“But, as he indicated this morning, he will be ready to play and it’s great to see him out here.” Reporting by Greg Stutchbury in Wellington; Editing by Peter Rutherford", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-09T05:15:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-09T11:24:52.008+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
