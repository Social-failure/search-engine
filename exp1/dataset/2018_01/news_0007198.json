Begu sent a forehand wide in a see-sawing sixth game as Halep broke again and took the first set on serve. \nFourth seed Begu, seeking a first win over Halep at her sixth attempt, fought back to lead 3-2 in the second set but Halep eventually subdued the comeback attempt to seal victory. \n”It was a tough match,“ Halep said in a courtside interview. ”I know she is a strong player and in the second set you could see she was improving her game so it was a tougher battle. \n“I think I was strong enough to stay there and hit the ball stronger in the end because the energy (from Begu) was falling a little bit. I came back, I served pretty well in the last game and I‘m pretty proud of my victory today, it was a tough one.” (Reporting by Shrivathsa Sridhar in Bengaluru; Editing by Amlan Chakraborty and Ken Ferris)", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-05T13:20:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-05T16:12:16.002+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
