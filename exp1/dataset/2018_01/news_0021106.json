Reuters has not edited the statements or confirmed their accuracy.\n@realDonaldTrump :\n- It just shows everyone how broken and unfair our Court System is when the opposing side in a case (such as DACA) always runs to the 9th Circuit and almost always wins before being reversed by higher courts. [0911 EST]\n- The fact that Sneaky Dianne Feinstein, who has on numerous occasions stated that collusion between Trump/Russia has not been found, would release testimony in such an underhanded and possibly illegal way, totally without authorization, is a disgrace. Must have tough Primary! [1000 EST]\n- The single greatest Witch Hunt in American history continues. There was no collusion, everybody including the Dems knows there was no collusion, & yet on and on it goes. Russia & the world is laughing at the stupidity they are witnessing. Republicans should finally take control! [1014 EST]\n- I want to thank my @Cabinet for working tirelessly on behalf of our country. 2017 was a year of monumental achievement and we look forward to the year ahead. Together, we are delivering results and MAKING AMERICA GREAT AGAIN! 45.wh.gov/CabinetMeeting [1508 EST]\n- Today, it was my great honor to welcome Prime Minister Erna Solberg of Norway to the @WhiteHouse - a great friend and ally of the United States! Joint press conference: 45.wh.gov/BzL9PX [1631 EST]\n- The United States needs the security of the Wall on the Southern Border, which must be part of any DACA approval. The safety and security of our country is #1! [1807 EST]\n- Cutting taxes and simplifying regulations makes America the place to invest! Great news as Toyota and Mazda announce they are bringing 4,000 JOBS and investing $1.6 BILLION in Alabama, helping to further grow our economy! [1837 EST]\n- Good news: Toyota and Mazda announce giant new Huntsville, Alabama, plant which will produce over 300,000 cars and SUVâ€™s a year and employ 4000 people. Companies are coming back to the U.S. in a very big way. Congratulations Alabama!
