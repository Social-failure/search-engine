His whereabouts have been unclear since around the time his term finished in October 2016.\nAnother former PRI official, Alejandro Gutierrez, was arrested last month. Chihuahua prosecutors accuse him of participating in a scheme to divert 250 million pesos ($13 million) in public funds earmarked for education.\nCorral has accused Mexico’s finance ministry of withholding funds to punish his government for investigating alleged PRI corruption.\nA member of the center-right opposition National Action Party (PAN), Corral was among those who called for Duarte’s extradition.\nThe PRI has faced a string of corruption scandals ahead of a presidential election in July. The corruption issue is expected to be a central theme in the campaign.\nReporting by Lizbeth Diaz; Writing by Julia Love; Editing by Paul Simao\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-01-20T04:53:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-20T03:03:14.019+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
