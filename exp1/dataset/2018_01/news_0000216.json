Fully booked equipment and crews have, for example, sent shares of Keane Group ( FRAC.N ), a smaller competitor, almost 37 percent higher since early December. \nWeatherford would have taken a 30 percent stake in OneStim, which was expected to contribute to the its earnings. \n“There was a scenario whereby Weatherford may have been in a position to monetize its 30 percent stake,” said Byron Pope, a managing director in Tudor Pickering Holt’s equity research division. \n\"There would have been precedent for Schlumberger wanting to own 100 percent of the joint venture,\" he added, pointing to Schlumberger's acquisition of Cameron's ownership stake in their OneSubsea joint venture in 2016.
