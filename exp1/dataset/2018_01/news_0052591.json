They added that it was the largest ever haul of undelivered mail in Italy.\nThe Vicenza postal service has promised to deliver the huge pile of post, albeit several years late.\nWriting by Crispian Balmer; Editing by Janet Lawrence\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-30T14:02:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-30T14:41:52.002+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
