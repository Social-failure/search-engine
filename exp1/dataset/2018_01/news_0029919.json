Without this adjustment, Zinc CoP per MT without Royalty would have been Rs. 67,082 in Q3 FY 2018\nNote:\n1) Historical numbers have been revised as per Ind-AS reporting\n2) Sales is reported net of Goods and Services Tax, whereas in the previous quarters Sales was inclusive of Excise Duty\n3) Numbers may not add up due to rounding off; historical numbers may have changed due to regrouping\nOperational Performance\nMined metal production in Q3 FY 2018 was up 10% sequentially at 240kt due to higher ore treatment. The y-o-y decrease was 13% driven primarily by decline in overall ore grades due to mine mix and lower production from Rampura Agucha open-cast mine, even as total ore treated was higher. For the nine-month period, mined metal production was up by 16% to 693kt from a year ago due to higher ore production from underground mines, partly offset by lower open-cast mine production.\nIntegrated zinc metal production was 200kt tonnes, 4% higher sequentially and 3% lower y-o-y. Integrated lead metal production was 46kt tonnes, 20% higher q-o-q and 18% higher y-o-y. This was in line with availability of mined metal and smelters. Integrated silver production was at 132 tonnes, 6% lower q-o-q on accumulation of WIP and up 12% y-o-y in line with higher lead production.\nFor the nine-month period, integrated zinc, lead and silver production were higher by 28% y-o-y, 26% y-o-y and 24% y-o-y respectively, in line with higher availability of mined metal.\nFinancial Performance\nRevenues during the quarter were at Rs. 5,846 Crore, an increase of 12% q-o-q and 10% y-o-y. The y-o-y increase was due to higher lead & silver volume and strong zinc & lead LME, partly offset by lower zinc volume and rupee appreciation. For the nine-month period, revenues were up by 35% y-o-y driven primarily by higher metal volumes and prices.\nThe cost of production before royalty (COP) for zinc during the quarter was at Rs. 66,118 per MT ($1,022), up 4% in INR and USD terms, compared to the previous quarter and up 14% y-o-y in INR and 19% in USD terms. The y-o-y increase was primarily on account of about 25% increase in prices of metcoke & imported coal and other commodities, and lower overall grades. For the nine-month period, COP was higher by 12.0% in INR and 17% in USD at Rs. 64,079 ($994) primarily due to over 50% increase in prices of metcoke & imported coal and other commodities.\nEBITDA for the quarter came in at Rs. 3,261 Crore, up 18% y-o-y and 7% q-o-q while YTD EBITDA increased by 46% y-o-y to Rs. 8,717 Crore.\nNet profit during the quarter was at Rs. 2,230 Crore, down 4% y-o-y and 12% q-o-q while for YTD net profit was up by 26% y-o-y to Rs. 6,651 Crore. Lower investment income on account of smaller corpus and lower rate of return and higher depreciation & tax rate partly offset gains in EBITDA. Excluding a one-time exceptional gain of Rs. 291 Crore in Q2 related to the Supreme Court's favourable judgement on District Mineral Fund levies, net profit during the quarter was at similar level as compared last quarter.\nAs announced last quarter, the Company has done forward sale of 220kt of zinc and 30kt of lead at $3,084 and $2,418 respectively for the period January to June 2018. Of this, 165kt (150kt of zinc and 15kt of lead) is for Q4 FY 2018 and remaining from April to June 2018. There were no further forward sales during the quarter.\nOutlook\nProduction guidance for FY 2018 is reiterated with mined metal to be higher than FY 2017, refined zinc-lead metal of about 950kt, refined silver metal of over 500 MT. Zinc COP for FY 2018 is projected to be in the range of $950 to $975 per MT due to continued increase in commodity prices offsetting benefit of higher volume and cost efficiency measures. The Company is on track to achieve 1.2 million MT per annum (mtpa) mined metal production capacity by FY 2020.\nExpansion Projects\nCapital mine development increased by 55% y-o-y and was flat q-o-q to 9,685 meters during the quarter across all mines. For the nine-month period, capital mine development was 28,126 meters, up 69% as compared to corresponding prior period.\n", "external_links": ["http://www.vedantalimited.com/", "http://sustainabledevelopment.vedantaresources.com/content/dam/vedanta/corporate/documents/Otherdocuments/SDreport2015-16/Vedanta%20SDR%20FY%2015-16.pdf", "http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/hindustan-zinc-limited-results-for-the-third-quarter-and-nine-months-ended-december-31-2017-300584530.html"], "published": "2018-01-18T15:17:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-18T16:20:03.009+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
