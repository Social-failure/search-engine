REUTERS/Charles Platiau Nevertheless, a joint statement on Tuesday from the CFDT, CFE-CGC, CGT and FO trade unions said that all four feared Siemens could do restructuring at the new, combined entity, which could result in later job cuts - hence their opposition.\nEarlier this month, Alstom boss Henri Poupart-Lafarge said he expected a July shareholders meeting to approve the Siemens deal.\nThe new company, with more than 62,000 employees, is targeting synergies of 470 million euros ($584 million) four years at the latest after the closing of the deal, which is expected at the end of 2018.\n($1 = 0.8053 euros)\nReporting by Gilbert Reilhac; Editing by Sudip Kar-Gupta\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-01-30T21:11:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-30T16:28:07.058+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
