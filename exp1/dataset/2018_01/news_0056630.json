SMFG and other Japanese banks disclose only cumulative nine-month figures. \nSMFG’s gains from its stock portfolio more than doubled in the nine months, as Japanese banks actively reduced holdings of their corporate clients’ shares originally purchased to cement business ties, a practice criticised as exposing the banks to market swings. \nA rally in the stock market at home and abroad also lifted the performance of its brokerage and investment banking unit. \nSMFG kept its full-year forecast of 630 billion yen, down 10.8 percent from the previous year, despite posting a net profit of 648.1 billion yen in the nine months. \nSMFG said in a statement it did not expect any major risk factors at the moment, but did not revise its full-year guidance in case of any changes in the business environment. \nIts forecast was below an average estimate of 680.6 billion yen in a poll of 12 analysts by Thomson Reuters. MIZUHO \nIn addition to hefty gains from its stock portfolio, a clawback of bad loan provisions lifted Mizuho’s net profit by 8.6 percent to 159 billion yen in the October-December period. \nThe bank said it booked a 169.4 billion yen gain for the nine-month period ended in December after it released bad loan provisions set aside in the past, as the likelihood of some borrowers’ defaulting had declined. \nWhile the lender has been hurt by rock-bottom interest rates amid the Bank of Japan’s massive stimulus measures, it said fee revenues improved in the latest quarter. \nFor the full year through March, Mizuho kept its net profit forecast of 550 billion yen, down 8.8 percent from the previous year, but above an average estimate of 544.2 billion yen in a poll of 14 analysts by Thomson Reuters. \nThe country’s No. 1 lender Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group will announce its results on Friday.
