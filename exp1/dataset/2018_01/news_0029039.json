Trading firm Glencore announced plans last year to start importing fuel for Mexico’s domestic market.\n“We are looking at all different kinds of operations there,” Rick Altizer, BP senior vice president of sales and marketing said on Wednesday. He said they are open to waterfront terminals, rail operations or other logistical assets to supply its stations.\nBP is also in the process of opening 10 stores in the U.S. Northeast under the Amoco brand, which it had previously retired. The Amoco label allows BP to expand in areas already saturated with BP stations, and appeals to customer nostalgia for the older label, Altizer said, speaking at an Amoco station in Pelham, New York. The label will also be used in other parts of the country.\nThe company expects global demand growth of 2.4 percent this year and 1.7 percent in 2019 even as automotive efficiency improves, he said.\nReporting By Jessica Resnick-Ault; Editing by Susan Thomas\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-01-18T06:33:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-18T12:39:23.046+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
