CTK news agency reported on Tuesday that the industry ministry had recommended joining the appeal. \nEnvironment Minister Richard Brabec said, however, the appeal had little chance of success and the government had decided against participating. \n“The decision means we will not join any attempt to soften these limits,” he told reporters after a government meeting. \n“We are convinced there is no hope for the suit to succeed, not even from the legal aspect, but the ecological aspect is also key.” \nThe EU decision taken last year imposes stricter limits on emissions of pollutants such as nitrogen oxide, sulphur dioxide, mercury and particulate matter from large combustion plants in Europe. \nPoland, which relies heavily on coal for power generation, has vowed to stick to the fossil fuel despite the EU’s requirements.
