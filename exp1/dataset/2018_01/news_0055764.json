If not we are doomed,” Arnaud de Puyfontaine, who last year was also appointed TIM’s executive chairman, said on the sidelines of a Reuters Breakingviews event in Milan. \n“We are competing against giants... Google, Apple, Time, Disney and Netflix... if we don’t want to be swallowed by those big giants, not to name the Chinese ones ... we have to have a European agenda. This agenda is a must,” he said. \n“And we are not talking about 30 years from now. This is something that is going to play out in the next five years.” \nDe Puyfontaine said he remained bullish about Italy and TIM. \nLast year Italy said it wanted a say in some of TIM’s strategic decisions on assets which Rome deems to be of national importance in a move seen as a way of reining in Vivendi’s influence. \nEarlier on Wednesday, de Puyfontaine said he was confident of resolving outstanding issues between the former state phone monopoly and the Italian government to enable a new era of improved relations. \n“The proof of the pudding is in the eating, but I‘m bullish about Italy,” he said.
