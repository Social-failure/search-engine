The projects still need company approvals.\nZhejiang Huayou, which has cobalt assets in top producer Democratic Republic of Congo, said its tie-up with Posco was prompted by the “rapid growth” in demand for materials used in lithium batteries.\nA Posco spokesman was not immediately available for comment.\nTight supply of battery ingredients, which include nickel, cobalt and manganese for cathodes, has driven up prices, prompting battery makers such as Contemporary Amperex Technology Co (CATL) to consider making upstream investments.\n“While the price uptrend momentum of these mineral products remains strong, possible price volatility related to China’s EV sales performance due to government subsidies cuts may present good opportunities for repositioning those cobalt/lithium related stocks,” Argonaut Securities said in a strategy paper.\nReporting by Tom Daly; Additional reporting by Hyunjoo Jin in Seoul; Editing by Edmund Blair\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-01-17T20:59:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-18T16:13:19.035+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
