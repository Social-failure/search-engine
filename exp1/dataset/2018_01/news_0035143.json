Of the 55 companies in the S&P 500 that have reported earnings through Monday morning, 80 percent have topped expectations, well above the 72 percent beat rate for the past four quarters. \nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJI rose 142.88 points, or 0.55 percent, to 26,214.6, the S&P 500 .SPX gained 22.67 points, or 0.81 percent, to 2,832.97 and the Nasdaq Composite .IXIC added 71.65 points, or 0.98 percent, to 7,408.03. \nHalliburton Co ( HAL.N ) climbed 6.40 percent after posting a much bigger-than-expected quarterly profit in the fourth quarter, benefiting from a shale-driven surge in U.S. oil production. \nThe Nasdaq biotech index .NBI rose 3.15 percent to notch its best day since June 21 after a flurry of merger activity in the sector with French drugmaker Sanofi ( SASY.PA ) and U.S.-based Celgene ( CELG.O ) splurging a combined total of more than $20 billion. \nShares in U.S. hemophilia specialist Bioverativ ( BIVV.O ) soared 61.89 percent after Sanofi agreed to buy the company for $11.6 billion. \nJuno Therapeutics ( JUNO.O ) jumped 26.83 percent after Celgene agreed to buy the biotech for about $9 billion in cash. \nIn other M&A news, AIG ( AIG.N ) said it would buy reinsurer Validus Holdings ( VR.N ) for $5.56 billion, sending the target’s shares up 44.03 percent. \nIndustrial stocks were one of the few laggards, as woes continued for General Electric ( GE.N ), down 0.55 after BofA-Merrill Lynch downgraded its stock. GE fell below $16 for the first time since 2011 and is down nearly 8 percent for the year. \nShares of Netflix Inc ( NFLX.O ), a major contributor to the recent stock rally, closed up 3.23 percent ahead of its quarterly results and added to gains in extended trading after its quarterly numbers were released. \nAdvancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 1.70-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.38-to-1 ratio favored advancers. \nThe S&P 500 posted 123 new 52-week highs and 3 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 202 new highs and 16 new lows. \nVolume on U.S. exchanges was 6.56 billion shares, above the 6.34 billion average for the full session over the last 20 trading days.
