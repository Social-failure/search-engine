He will visit the Amazon jungle city of Puerto Maldonado and the northern city of Trujillo as well as the capital, Lima. \n“I see it going very well, above all in Trujillo and Puerto Maldonado. There will be good news and we ask the pope to pray with all the Andean priests,” said shaman Juan Osco, as he tossed flower petals over the pope’s image.

Barros denies accusations that he protected a priest found guilty in a Vatican investigation of abusing teenage boys.

He shared a meal with Mapuche in Chile on Wednesday. \nShamans from different indigenous groups in Peru frequently give their visions for events, politicians and soccer games.
