(NASDAQ:CPLP) (“CPLP” or the “Partnership”) today announced that its Board of Directors has approved the acquisition of the eco-type crude tanker ‘Aristaios’ (112,800 dwt, Ice Class 1C, built 2017, Daehan Shipbuilding Co. Ltd., S. Korea) for a total consideration of $52.5 million from the Partnership’s sponsor, Capital Maritime & Trading Corp. (‘Capital Maritime’). The M/T ‘Aristaios’ is currently employed under a time charter to Tesoro Far East Maritime Company (‘Tesoro’) at a gross daily rate of $26,400. The Tesoro charter commenced in January 2017 with duration of five years +/- 45 days.

The term loan bears interest at LIBOR plus a margin of 2.85% and is payable in twelve consecutive semi-annual installments of approximately $1.0 million beginning in July 2018, plus a balloon payment payable together with the last semi-annual installment due in January 2024.
