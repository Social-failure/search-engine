The primary purposes of Xtant's entry into the Restructuring Agreement are to reform its capital structure, meet its liquidity needs, reposition itself for long-term growth, and regain compliance with NYSE American LLC (formerly the NYSE MKT) listing standards. Xtant plans to hold a Special Meeting of Stockholders to vote on matters required to be approved by stockholders in connection with the transactions contemplated by the Restructuring Agreement (the “Transactions”).\n\"We are pleased to have signed an agreement to restructure and recapitalize our debt with the noteholders. This will reposition the company for long-term growth and allow the company to regain compliance with the NYSE American.\" said Carl O’Connell, Chief Executive Officer of Xtant Medical, \"Furthermore, the private placement will provide the liquidity to meet our operating needs going forward.\"\nBelow is a summary of the Transactions:\nTier 1 Transaction\nOn January 17, 2018, and as contemplated by the Restructuring Agreement, ROS and OrbiMed converted the Notes issued to them in January 2017 in the aggregate principal amount of $1.627 million, plus accrued and unpaid interest, at the $0.7589 per share conversion rate originally provided thereunder, into approximately 2.3 million shares of common stock of the Company.\nReverse Stock Split and Amendment to Certificate of Incorporation\nUpon approval of the stockholders of Xtant, the Company will amend its certificate of incorporation to, among other things, effect a reverse stock split of its common stock at a ratio of 1:12.
