The new policy builds on the 2.5 percent annual dividend growth plan implemented in 2016.\n“Exelon’s business position has continued to strengthen since 2016 with more earnings coming from our regulated utilities following the PHI acquisition, sustained industry leading utility earnings per share growth and greater stability for our generation fleet with the Illinois and New York zero emissions credit programs that sustain these carbon free, low cost assets,” said Christopher M. Crane, Exelon’s president and CEO. “We’ve also continued to focus on cost management and prudent balance sheet management. I am pleased we are able to share more of our financial success with our shareholders through this updated dividend policy.”\nIn light of the updated dividend policy, the board declared a regular quarterly dividend of $0.345 per share on Exelon’s common stock, a 5 percent increase from the previous amount of $0.3275.
