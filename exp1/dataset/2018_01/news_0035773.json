Calgary had won the seven previous meetings in the Stampede City. Buffalo also snapped a two-game losing skid.\nIt’s the second consecutive game the Flames have opened the scoring but lost in extra time. Matthew Tkachuk gave the hosts the lead eight minutes into the affair. Tkachuk was parked at the doorstep on a Calgary power play and deflected Johnny Gaudreau’s thigh-high shot up over Johnson’s shoulder.\nIn their last nine games, Gaudreau has collected 14 points (2 goals, 12 assists) and Tkachuk has garnered 10 points (6, 4).\nIt was a short-lived edge, though, as Buffalo’s Scott Wilson responded just 24 seconds later. Calgary’s Mark Jankowski attempted a pass that defenseman Travis Hamonic couldn’t handle as they looked to break out of the zone. The puck went right to Wilson in the slot, and he made no mistake in beating Mike Smith for his second goal of the season.\nSmith made 31 saves for the Flames, who are 7-0-2 in their last nine games.\nBuffalo defenseman Nathan Beaulieu left the game in the first period after Curtis Lazar collided with him in an incidental leg-on-leg hit.\n--Field Level Media\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-01-23T13:13:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-23T18:17:06.006+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
