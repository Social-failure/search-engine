They are widely used in data centers.\nLam’s upbeat results come a day after chipmaker Texas Instruments’ ( TXN.O ) results showed signs of slowing revenue growth, which sent jitters in the chip sector and drove many stocks lower on Wednesday.\nXilinx Inc ( XLNX.O ), a manufacturer of programmable chips, also posted strong results on Wednesday, sending its shares up 5 percent.\nLam said it expects current-quarter revenue of $2.85 billion, give or take $125 million. Analysts on average were expecting $2.64 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.\n“In 2018 we expect record levels of customer equipment spending,” Anstice said in a statement.\nLam recorded a net loss of $10 million in the December-quarter, compared to a profit of $332.8 million in the year-ago quarter, hurt by a $757 million one-time charge related to new U.S. tax laws.\nExcluding the charge and other items, Lam posted a profit of $4.34 per share, ahead of analysts’ average estimate of $3.68 per share.\nTotal revenue rose 37 percent to $2.58 billion and edged past analysts’ expectations of $2.57 billion.\nReporting by Munsif Vengattil in Bengaluru; editing by Sai Sachin Ravikumar\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-01-25T05:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-25T10:13:31.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
