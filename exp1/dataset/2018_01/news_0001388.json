An adult found guilty of assaulting a soldier could be jailed for up to 10 years, but Tamimi is a minor so such an outcome is unlikely.\nWhile Singapore’s authorities are known to keep a tight rein on public speech and the media, especially when it comes to matters related to race and religion, outright bans are more rare.\nAdela Foo, the organizer of the Singapore festival, called the ban “understandable”, without elaborating.\n“At the end of the day, the IMDA’s position is one to be respected,” the 23-year-old student told Reuters.\nWith a sizable Muslim minority and surrounded by Muslim majority neighbors where sympathy for the Palestinian cause runs high, Singapore maintains friendly diplomatic and military ties with Israel. But it has lined up with many other countries opposed to U.S. President Donald Trump’s recognition of Jerusalem as Israel’s capital.\nAround 15 percent of Singapore’s 3.3 million resident population aged 15 years and over identify as Muslim, recent government surveys show.\nReporting by Fathin Ungku; Editing by John Geddie & Simon Cameron-Moore\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-03T12:54:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-03T13:04:16.059+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
