It forces them to take one-time hits on earnings held abroad and changes the treatment of deferred tax assets, both of which affect Citigroup in particular. \nHowever, banks and other large U.S. corporations expect to benefit greatly from lower taxes and other provisions in the new law over the long term. \nCitigroup, the fourth-largest U.S. lender, stands to gain less than peers because it already earns about half of its profits in lower-tax countries abroad. Even so, it expects its tax rate to fall to about 25 percent this year from 30 percent in 2017. That could save the bank billions of dollars over the next few years. \nThe changes will not only boost Citigroup’s profits, but allow the bank to generate higher returns and generate more capital, Chief Executive Michael Corbat said. The new law might also stimulate economic growth because it incentivizes companies to invest in their businesses and has led to wage hikes that could help consumers, he said. \n“Tax reform is a clear net positive for Citi and its shareholders,” Corbat said on a conference call with analysts. \nManagement is now examining financial performance targets set before the tax law changes to see whether they should be lifted, Chief Financial Officer John Gerspach said on a separate call with journalists. \nCitigroup shares rose 1 percent to $77.58 in morning trading. The bank already plans to return at least $60 billion worth of capital to investors through stock buybacks and dividends. \nLagging competitors in growth and not earning its cost of capital, Citigroup’s valuation has not kept up with rivals like JPMorgan Chase and Bank of America Corp. Investors and analysts have been pushing Citi to prove it can grow revenue and profits as a second act to shrinking and returning capital.

Other lenders, including JPMorgan Chase & Co, also have exposure to Steinhoff, which has been embroiled in an accounting scandal. \nIn reports on Tuesday morning, several analysts said Citi’s results were modestly ahead of Wall Street’s best guess and that they were more focused on whether the bank would lift performance targets. \n“Results could prove ‘good enough’ this quarter,” Instinet analyst Steven Chubak wrote in a note to clients. \nCiti’s results follow JPMorgan and Wells Fargo last week. Bank of America Corp and Goldman Sachs Group Inc plan to report fourth-quarter results on Wednesday, with Morgan Stanley expected to report on Thursday.
