Oaktree received the stake in connection with a rescue financing package it provided to Billabong in 2013 along with US private equity firm Centerbridge Partners, which currently owns 19.2%.\nBoardriders’ new debt will include a US$150m asset-based revolving credit facility and a $450 million term loan with a first priority claim, the sources said.\nBank of America Merrill Lynch will arrange the revolving credit facility, the sources said. Deutsche Bank will lead the term loan alongside BAML and Macquarie Capital.\nProceeds will be used to fund the Billabong acquisition and refinance debt at both companies.\nBAML, Deutsche Bank, Macquarie and Oaktree declined to comment.\nBoardriders is buying Billabong for an enterprise value of A$380m, or a multiple of 7.4 times Billabong’s pro forma 2017 Ebitda, or earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization, according to a Billabong press release. The valuation is equivalent to roughly $300 million.\nThe combined company’s Ebitda will total roughly $100 million, not accounting for synergies arising from the merger, two of the sources said.\nSyndication of the financing is likely to begin in March, although timing is dependent on factors influencing the transaction such as shareholder, court and regulatory approval, the same sources said.\nThe deal is expected to close in April.\nReporting by Andrew Berln; Editing By Jon Methven\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-01-11T03:56:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-11T00:19:51.038+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
