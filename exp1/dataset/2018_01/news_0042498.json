Some have created new pieces for the company. \n“We are bringing more choreographers of relevance to Cuba than any other company but at the same time launching the career of Cuban choreographers,” he said in an interview, adding that he hoped the new pieces would reflect the “new Cuba.” \nIn its new season next month, Acosta Danza will perform four Cuban premieres of pieces by foreign choreographers, including “Rooster,” created in 1991 by Britain’s Christopher Bruce. \n“Rooster,” which Acosta performed during his 1990s stint at the Houston Ballet, celebrates the swinging 1960s and 1970s to Rolling Stones music once banned in Cuba.

In 2007, he published his autobiography “No Way Home.” Reporting by Sarah Marsh; Editing by Richard Chang", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-25T03:12:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-25T03:43:00.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
