Yet it may take a while before the standard compact car can match the marvels of the 2017 Bugatti Chiron. \nThe Chiron is a $2.9 million, 1,500 horsepower supercar that can go from zero to 249 mph in about 30 seconds, and Jay Leno was lucky enough to take the technological tour de force out for a spin. Joining him was Jessi Combs, aka the \"Fastest Woman on Four Wheels.\" \nIn 2013 Combs clocked an average speed of almost 392 MPH in a 1 mile stretch in the Oregon desert, cementing her place in history. \nCombs more than knows her way around cars and motorcycles, aptly nick-naming the Chiron her \"unicorn,\" and you better believe this car is magical. She and Jay hopped into the red leather front seats to see what they could do — without going to jail for speeding. And what they did, was go for a ride that was lightning fast, but still smooth as silk. \nAccording to Jay, the motivation behind making a car like the Chiron is to prove it can be done, and pretty soon the results of that risk will be seen by everyday car consumers who have Bugatti taste on a Buick budget. \nJay said: \"It's not the fact that it's the fastest car, it's the fact that it just moves the technology meter forward a little bit.\" \nCheck out more groundbreaking vehicles on all-new episodes of \" Jay Leno's Garage .\" Thursdays at 10 p.m. ET/PT.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-27T20:01:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-27T20:01:20.006+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
