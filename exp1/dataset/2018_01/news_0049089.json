A model with 256 GB of storage was released simultaneously for $1,150.\nIt is the firm's first phone to be equipped with an organic light-emitting diode (OLED) screen.\nApple is expected to maintain a total production target of 30 million units for lower-priced models like the iPhone 8, iPhone 8 Plus and iPhone 7, according to the Nikkei report.\nShares of Apple were down by around half a percent in U.S. premarket trade. Apple was not immediately available for comment when contacted by CNBC.\nThe share price of a number of semiconductors who supply technology to the corporation appeared to mostly shrug off the news, with Austria-based AMS trading more than 17 percent higher after raising its revenue forecast and U.K.-based Dialog Semiconductor rising more than 2 percent.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-29T13:43:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-29T13:43:33.009+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
