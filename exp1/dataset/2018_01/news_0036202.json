Other members include the chief executives of Northrop Grumman Corp , Johnson & Johnson and General Motors Co.\nSpending on lobbyists by the National Association of Manufacturers rose to $2.4 million from $1.3 million, quarter-over-quarter.\nThe National Association of Manufacturers said it could not comment late on Monday. The Business Roundtable and the Chamber of Commerce did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\nLobbyists played a outsized role in shaping the tax overhaul.\nRepublican Congressman Kevin Brady, chairman of the tax-writing U.S. House Ways and Means Committee, told Reuters last year that an aggressive corporate lobbying effort had derailed a Republican-backed border tax, forcing lawmakers working on tax reform to seek alternatives.
