They are underestimating the sea change that GDPR brings about.”\nThe GDPR will apply to any company offering services in the EU, regardless of where it is headquartered.\nReporting by Julia Fioretti; Editing by Hugh Lawson\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-24T20:25:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-24T20:38:26.039+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
