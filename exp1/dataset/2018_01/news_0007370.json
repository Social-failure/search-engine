Giske, who had been seen as a contender to lead the party in the future, remains a member of Norway’s parliament. \nThe next parliamentary election is not due until 2021. \nA number of figures from politics, corporate life and entertainment in several countries have quit or been fired in recent weeks as women have come forward with accusations of abuse and harassment. \nThe social movement aimed at raising awareness of sexual harassment and assault, epitomised by the #MeToo social media hashtag, was last month named Time magazine’s 2017 “Person of the Year”.
