The route is widely used to transport Uzbek workers to and from Russia where they often take work on building sites.\nOnly five people managed to escape the burning vehicle, the interior ministry’s emergencies department said in a statement.\nA view shows a burnt-out bus in which people travelling on a route used by migrant workers heading to Russia died in a fire, in the Aktobe region, Kazakhstan January 18, 2018.

It said senior government officials would investigate the matter.\nA photograph posted online from the site showed the bus completely burnt out. Video footage also posted on the Web showed it positioned diagonally across a two-lane freeway in the middle of a snow-covered steppe, in flames and emitting heavy black smoke.\nPeople put a bandage on a man's hand at the scene of an incident involving a bus burning on a route used by migrant workers heading to Russia, in the Aktobe region, Kazakhstan January 18, 2018.
