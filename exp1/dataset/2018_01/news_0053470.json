The Company’s first quarter of fiscal 2018 results included an estimated income tax benefit of $1.1 billion, or $4.19 per diluted share, as a result of the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. The adjusted tax rate was 25.2% for the quarter and the effective tax rate was not meaningful. WestRock’s Corrugated Packaging segment delivered Segment EBITDA margin of 19.6% and North American Adjusted Segment EBITDA margin of 21.4%, up 480 and 560 basis points, respectively. Achieved $60 million in year-over-year productivity and a run rate of $910 million of synergy and performance improvements since the creation of WestRock Invested $108 million in the Gondi, S.A. de C.V. (“Grupo Gondi”) joint venture to support its capital expansion plans, bringing WestRock’s ownership interest to 32.3%.\n“Our team executed well against our strategy and delivered a strong quarter to start our fiscal year. We are creating value for our customers with WestRock’s differentiated portfolio of paper and packaging solutions,” said Steve Voorhees, WestRock’s chief executive officer. “The outlook for paper and packaging remains attractive and we are well positioned to achieve our financial goals for fiscal 2018 and beyond.”\nConsolidated Financial Results\nWestRock’s performance for the three months ended December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016 (in millions):\nThree Months Ended Three Months Ended Dec. 31, 2017 Dec. 31, 2016 Change Net sales $ 3,894.0 $ 3,447.2 $ 446.8 Segment income $ 355.8 $ 230.8 $ 125.0 Non-allocated expenses (8.3 ) (14.7 ) 6.4 Depreciation 226.9 214.6 12.3 Amortization 80.8 60.6 20.2 Less: Deferred financing costs (1.5 ) (1.1 ) (0.4 ) Segment EBITDA $ 653.7 $ 490.2 $ 163.5 Inventory step-up, net of LIFO 0.6 - 0.6 Adjusted Segment EBITDA $ 654.3 $ 490.2 $ 164.1 The $447 million increase in net sales was primarily attributable to $235 million of increased Corrugated Packaging segment sales driven by higher selling price/mix, $252 million of increased Consumer Packaging segment sales, primarily due to the contribution from the Multi Packaging Solutions (“MPS”) acquisition, partially offset by the absence of net sales from WestRock’s former Home Health & Beauty (“HH&B”) business in the current year quarter due to the sale of HH&B in April 2017. In addition, Land and Development segment sales were $43 million lower.\nThe $125 million increase in segment income was primarily due to $123 million of increased Corrugated Packaging segment income and $5 million of increased Consumer Packaging segment income, which was partially offset by $2 million of decreased Land and Development segment income.\nAdditional information about the changes in segment sales and segment income is included in the segment discussions below.\nRestructuring and Other Items\nRestructuring and other items during the first quarter of fiscal 2018 included the following pre-tax costs and expenses:\n$10 million of integration expenses $4 million of restructuring costs primarily associated with the consolidation of operations and on-going costs related to previously closed facilities $2 million of acquisition expenses\nMultiemployer Pension Withdrawal\nDuring the first quarter of fiscal 2018, WestRock submitted notification to withdraw from the Pace Industry Union-Management Pension Fund (“PIUMPF”) and recorded an estimated withdrawal liability of $180 million. The estimate assumes the withdrawal liability will be paid over 20 years and a one-time payment of our expected portion of the accumulated funding deficiency.\nCash Provided By Operating, Financing and Investing Activities\nNet cash provided by operating activities was $364 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2018, compared to $517 million in the prior year quarter primarily due to changes in working capital and decreased real estate sales. Total debt was $6.6 billion at December 31, 2017. Consistent with WestRock’s disciplined capital allocation strategy, during the first quarter, WestRock invested $214 million in capital expenditures, paid $110 million in dividends to its stockholders and invested $108 million to increase its ownership interest in Grupo Gondi.\nSegment Results\nCorrugated Packaging Segment\nThree Months Ended Three Months Ended Dec. 31, 2017 Dec. 31, 2016 Change Segment sales $ 2,178.6 $ 1,943.6 $ 235.0 Segment income $ 264.1 $ 141.5 $ 122.6 Depreciation 137.0 123.5 13.5 Amortization 26.1 21.9 4.2 Segment EBITDA $ 427.2 $ 286.9 $ 140.3 Inventory step-up, net of LIFO 0.6 - 0.6 Adjusted Segment EBITDA $ 427.8 $ 286.9 $ 140.9 Operating Highlights for the Three Months Ended December 31, 2017:\nThe Corrugated Packaging segment delivered Segment EBITDA margin of 19.6% and North American Adjusted EBITDA margin of 21.4%, up 480 and 560 basis points, respectively. Segment sales increased $235 million primarily due to an estimated $182 million of favorable corrugated selling price/mix and $42 million of higher corrugated volume including the impact of Hurricane Matthew on the prior year quarter Segment income increased $123 million as favorable corrugated selling price/mix and productivity were only partially offset by cost inflation and other items North America box shipments increased 4.0% on a per day basis Brazil box shipments increased 7.1%\nConsumer Packaging Segment\nThree Months Ended Three Months Ended Dec. 31, 2017 Dec. 31, 2016 Change Segment sales $ 1,763.3 $ 1,510.9 $ 252.4 Segment income $ 92.4 $ 87.6 $ 4.8 Depreciation 88.0 88.6 (0.6 ) Amortization 54.0 38.4 15.6 Segment EBITDA $ 234.4 $ 214.6 $ 19.8 Operating Highlights for the Three Months Ended December 31, 2017:\nSegment sales increased $252 million primarily due to a $424 million increase from acquisitions, partially offset by a $143 million decrease related to the sale of HH&B and $25 million of aggregate lower volume along with unfavorable price/mix Segment income increased $22 million due to acquisitions, which was partially offset by $14 million of HH&B income in the prior year quarter Shipments of paperboard and converted products increased 7%, driven primarily by acquisitions\nLand and Development Segment\nThree Months Ended Three Months Ended Dec. 31, 2017 Dec. 31, 2016 Change Segment sales $ 11.4 $ 54.0 $ (42.6 ) Segment income (loss) $ (0.7 ) $ 1.7 $ (2.4 ) Depreciation 0.1 0.2 (0.1 ) Segment EBITDA $ (0.6 ) $ 1.9 $ (2.5 ) WestRock’s monetization strategy is proceeding as previously disclosed. In the three months ended December 31, 2017, the Company recorded a $28 million pre-tax non-cash impairment of certain mineral rights and real estate, which is not included in the segment loss. We have excluded the results of the Land and Development segment, as well as the impairment noted above, from adjusted earnings per diluted share.\nConference Call\nAs previously announced, WestRock will host a conference call to discuss its results of operations for the first quarter of fiscal 2018 and other topics that may be raised during the discussion at 8:30 a.m., Eastern Time, on January 29, 2018.

However, management believes certain non-GAAP financial measures provide investors and other users with additional meaningful financial information that should be considered when assessing our ongoing performance. Management also uses these non-GAAP financial measures in making financial, operating and planning decisions, and in evaluating WestRock’s performance. Non-GAAP financial measures should be viewed in addition to, and not as an alternative for, WestRock’s GAAP results. The non-GAAP financial measures we present may differ from similarly captioned measures presented by other companies. We discuss below details of the non-GAAP financial measures presented by us and provide reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP.\nAdjusted Segment EBITDA\nWestRock uses “Adjusted Segment EBITDA”, along with other factors, to evaluate our segment performance against our peers. Management believes this measure is also useful to investors to evaluate WestRock’s performance relative to its peers. The consolidated financial results and segment tables include a reconciliation of “Adjusted Segment EBITDA” to “Segment EBITDA”.\nAdjusted Segment EBITDA Margins\nWestRock uses “Adjusted Segment EBITDA Margins”, along with other factors, to evaluate our segment performance against our peers. Management believes this measure is also useful to investors to evaluate WestRock’s performance relative to its peers. “Segment EBITDA Margin” is calculated for each segment by dividing that segment’s Segment EBITDA by Segment sales. “Adjusted Segment EBITDA Margin” is calculated for each segment by dividing that segment’s Adjusted Segment EBITDA by Adjusted Segment Sales.\nSet forth below is a reconciliation of Adjusted Segment Sales, Adjusted Segment EBITDA and Adjusted Segment EBITDA Margins to the most directly comparable GAAP measures, Segment Sales and Segment Income for the quarter ended December 31, 2017 (in millions, except percentages):\nCorrugated\nPackaging Consumer\nPackaging Land and\nDevelopment Corporate\n/ Elim.

Management believes this non-GAAP financial measure provides WestRock’s board of directors, investors, potential investors, securities analysts and others with useful information to evaluate its performance relative to other periods because it excludes certain cash restructuring and other costs, net of tax that management believes are not indicative of the ongoing operating results of the business. WestRock believes that the most directly comparable GAAP measure is “Net cash provided by operating activities”.

Management believes these non-GAAP financial measures provide WestRock’s board of directors, investors, potential investors, securities analysts and others with useful information to evaluate its performance because they exclude restructuring and other costs, net, and other specific items that management believes are not indicative of the ongoing operating results of the business. WestRock and its board of directors use these measures to evaluate its performance relative to other periods. WestRock believes that the most directly comparable GAAP measures are Net income attributable to common stockholders, represented in the table below as the GAAP Results for Consolidated net income (i.e. Net of Tax) plus Noncontrolling interests, and Earnings per diluted share, respectively. This press release includes a reconciliation of Earnings per diluted share to Adjusted earnings per diluted share. Set forth below is a reconciliation of Adjusted net income to Net income attributable to common stockholders (in millions).\nThree Months Ended Dec. 31, 2017 Pre-Tax Tax Net of Tax GAAP Results (1) $ 60.3 $ 1,073.2 $ 1,133.5 Impact of Tax Cuts and Jobs Act - (1,086.9 ) (1,086.9 ) Multiemployer pension withdrawal 179.1 (46.6 ) 132.5 Restructuring and other items 16.3 (4.0 ) 12.3 Acquisition inventory step-up 0.6 (0.2 ) 0.4 Land and Development operating results including\nimpairment 25.9 (6.5 ) 19.4 Losses at closed plants and transition costs 13.2 (3.5 ) 9.7 Accelerated depreciation on major capital projects 5.1 (1.3 ) 3.8 Loss on extinguishment of debt 1.0 (0.2 ) 0.8 Other (1.4 ) 0.3 (1.1 ) Adjusted Results $ 300.1 $ (75.7 ) $ 224.4 Noncontrolling interests 1.6 Adjusted Net Income $ 226.0 (1) The GAAP results for Pre-Tax, Tax and Net of Tax are equivalent to the line items \"Income before income taxes\",\n\"Income tax (benefit) expense\" and \"Consolidated net income\", respectively, as reported on the statements of income.\nThree Months Ended Dec. 31, 2016 Pre-Tax Tax Net of Tax GAAP Results (1) $ 82.1 $ (3.6 ) $ 78.5 Restructuring and other items 81.0 (21.7 ) 59.3 One-time state tax benefit - (23.8 ) (23.8 ) Land and Development operating results including\nimpairment (1.0 ) 0.4 (0.6 ) Losses at closed plants and transition costs 4.2 (1.4 ) 2.8 Other 2.5 (0.8 ) 1.7 Adjusted Results $ 168.8 $ (50.9 ) $ 117.9 Noncontrolling interests 2.4 Adjusted Net Income $ 120.3 (1) The GAAP results for Pre-Tax, Tax and Net of Tax are equivalent to the line items \"Income before income taxes\",\n\"Income tax (benefit) expense\" and \"Consolidated net income\", respectively, as reported on the statements of income. Adjusted Tax Rate\nWestRock uses the non-GAAP financial measure “Adjusted Tax Rate”. Management believes this non-GAAP financial measure is useful because it adjusts our effective tax rate to exclude the impact of restructuring and other costs, net, and other specific items that management believes are not indicative of the ongoing operating results of the business. “Adjusted Tax Rate” is calculated as “Adjusted Tax Expense” divided by “Adjusted Pre-Tax Income”. WestRock believes that the most directly comparable GAAP measure is “Income tax expense”. Set forth in the table above is a reconciliation of “Adjusted Tax Expense” to “Income tax expense” for the three months ended December 31, 2017. The results of which, are included in the table below to compute the “Adjusted Tax Rate” (in millions).\nThree Months Adusted pre-tax income $ 300.1 Adjusted tax expense (75.7 ) $ 224.4 Adjusted Tax Rate 25.2 % Adjusted Earnings per Diluted Share\nSet forth below is a reconciliation Earnings per diluted share to Adjusted earnings per diluted share.\nThree Months\nEnded Three Months\nEnded December 31, 2017 December 31, 2016 Earnings per diluted share $ 4.38 $ 0.32 Impact of Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (4.19 ) - Multiemployer pension withdrawal 0.51 - Restructuring and other items 0.05 0.22 One-time state tax benefit - (0.09 ) Land and Development operating results including impairment 0.07 - Losses at closed plants and transition costs 0.04 0.01 Accelerated depreciation on major capital projects 0.01 - Other - 0.01 Adjusted earnings per diluted share $ 0.87\n$\n0.47 CONTACT:\nWestRock\nInvestors:\nJames Armstrong, 470-328-6327\nVice President – Investor Relations\njames.armstrong@westrock.com\nJohn Stakel, 678-291-7901\nSenior Vice President – Treasurer\njohn.stakel@westrock.com\nMedia:\nJohn Pensec, 470-328-6397\nDirector, Corporate Communications\nmediainquiries@westrock.com\nSource:WestRock Shared Services, LLC", "external_links": ["https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=Jgqm2ig6_2chTdt7sLPue4V0RysctzH1Weo-Dv8oeRrczscGBupQebgPfdfNOpmuDuTrjjAYLc-42GCdEMY9JKTLPLz0Hw4eAgMwv7UQrlplOeBvNpfTbyHykWK0iJW2", "https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=Q5u0C5Bv6qkmHo6R1zF6l2hkFmIXU9EmEZeUnVfBenD7W7iTeXBJs8bCjaEXAj2-KMH7FGyJ6N70t_23U3-_HQ==", "https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=cDPJ0Z_pRQiz6shTRppdwvVZena8m_MfgA7pLnm8Wck7pnFR_-7PI717IfugVIH2Ij1gjam1MHLGzVcnKV5MthZq1g2llYjxiIm3aizzVbI=", "https://www.globenewswire.com/NewsRoom/AttachmentNg/4ee9b81f-2d35-49eb-8488-4559dc3599be", "https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=bqveMFl6y0Ceg6Ti0z09MJ--N5hFcDhnpBZeS0S9767f1R8wrtmV-lqaVQQ_dtvspyt2Qal_HcM297mkxzzzYJFitmNdUtuO9doTCtcPtPFQPhynfUKSSRGroet1sjli"], "published": "2018-01-29T14:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-29T16:46:58.015+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
