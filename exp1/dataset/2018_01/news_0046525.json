The Company reported fourth quarter adjusted net income 1 of $17.3 million, or $0.37 per share, representing a 46% or $5.5 million increase from the fourth quarter of 2016. Full-year 2017 net income was $42.9 million, or $0.99 per share, a 47% or $13.7 million increase compared to prior year results. Full-year 2017 adjusted net income 1 was $55.3 million, or $1.28 per share, a 42% or $16.3 million increase compared to prior year results.\nFor the fourth quarter 2017, return on average tangible assets was 0.97%, return on average tangible shareholders’ equity was 10.7%, and the efficiency ratio was 64.0%, compared to 1.12%, 12.5% and 58.9%, respectively, in the prior quarter and 1.00%, 12.5%, and 62.4%, respectively, in the fourth quarter of 2016. Adjusted return on average tangible assets 1 was 1.23%, adjusted return on average tangible shareholders’ equity 1 was 13.5%, and the adjusted efficiency ratio 1 was 52.6%, compared to 1.16%, 12.8%, and 57.7%, respectively, in the prior quarter, and 1.05%, 13.1%, and 60.8%, respectively, in the fourth quarter of 2016.\nDennis S. Hudson, III, Seacoast’s Chairman and CEO, said, “Seacoast’s 2017 performance demonstrated our ability to consistently grow our banking franchise through both organic initiatives and prudent acquisitions, while simultaneously delivering record shareholder returns, highlighted by a 23% year-over-year increase in adjusted earnings per share. As we navigated the near-term impact of Hurricane Irma, we continued to drive earnings expansion while retaining the quality of our loan portfolio and investing to support our long-term growth objectives.”\nHudson added, “We expect that the recently passed Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 will further strengthen economic fundamentals across Florida. Our expansion into South Florida, Orlando and Tampa positions Seacoast to capture this expected economic growth in the coming year as we provide a compelling value proposition for consumers and business customers living and operating in these markets.”\nHudson concluded, “The continued execution of our balanced growth strategy, combined with the additional financial resources provided by the tax cut, will enable Seacoast to accelerate investments in our franchise, deliver incremental value for all stakeholders, and further advance our momentum toward our Vision 2020 objectives, which we introduced at our investor day last year.”\nCharles M. Shaffer, Seacoast’s Chief Financial Officer, said, “We have been successful in allocating capital throughout the year into accretive opportunities, offsetting the initial dilution from our share issuance in February 2017. We have increased our tangible book value per share from $9.37 per share at the start of the year to $11.15 at year end, representing 19% growth in tangible capital per share. We are exiting the year with a ratio of tangible common equity to tangible assets of 9.4% and a loan to deposit ratio of 83%, providing both capital and low-cost funding for accretive growth in 2018. Our low cost of funding and asset sensitive balance sheet position us well for continued earnings growth in 2018.”\nUpdate on Vision 2020 and the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017\nWe are confident in our ability to achieve our Vision 2020 targets announced at investor day in February of 2017. The enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 on December 22, 2017 should have a significant positive impact on the United States economy and growth in our Florida markets. This clearly creates an opportunity for us to accelerate the achievement of our Vision 2020 objectives, through increased growth and appropriate investments. As the impact of this new legislation on our operating markets materializes, we will provide further updates on our progress and updated objectives.\nVision 2020 Targets Return on Tangible Assets 1.30%+ Return on Tangible Common Equity 16%+ Efficiency Ratio Below 50% Notable Items Affecting Fourth Quarter 2017 Results; These Items are Excluded from the Presentation of Adjusted Results\nAdditional income tax expense of $8.6 million was recorded to write down the Company’s net deferred tax asset as a result of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017. This estimate is subject to additional procedures which could result in further adjustments in future periods. A $15.2 million gain on the sale of shares of Visa Class B stock was recorded in the fourth quarter. These shares were purchased in early 2017. Merger and acquisition related charges associated with the purchase of Palm Beach Community Bank and NorthStar Banking Corporation totaled $6.8 million. These charges primarily represent change in control payments, legal and investment banking fees, and technology contract termination fees associated with the two acquisitions.\nUpdate on Hurricane Impacts\nThe Company recorded a charge-off of $0.6 million related to a customer with a Caribbean export business which was severely impacted by the fall season hurricanes. Loan pipelines and production across all business lines were disrupted by the storms, the result of business interruption over multiple weeks in the fourth quarter.\nFourth Quarter 2017 Financial Highlights\nIncome Statement\nNet income was $13.0 million, or $0.28 per average common diluted share, compared to $14.2 million or $0.32 for the prior quarter and $10.8 million or $0.28 for the fourth quarter of 2016. For the year ended December 31, 2017, net income was $42.9 million, or $0.99 per average common diluted share, compared to $29.2 million or $0.78 for the year ended December 31, 2016. Adjusted net income 1 was $17.3 million, or $0.37 per average common diluted share, compared to $15.1 million or $0.35 for the prior quarter and $11.8 million or $0.31 for the fourth quarter of 2016. For the year ended December 31, 2017, adjusted net income 1 was $55.3 million, or $1.28 per average common diluted share, compared to $39.1 million or $1.04 for the year ended December 31, 2016. Net revenues were $74.9 million, an increase of $17.7 million or 31% compared to the prior quarter, and an increase of $27.5 million or 58% from the fourth quarter of 2016. For the year ended December 31, 2017, net revenues were $234.8 million, an increase of $57.4 million or 32% compared to the year ended December 31, 2016.

For the year ended December 31, 2017, adjusted revenues 1 were $219.5 million, an increase of $43.0 million or 24% compared to the year ended December 31, 2016. Net interest income totaled $48.2 million, an increase of $2.5 million or 5% from the prior quarter and an increase of $10.8 million or 29% from the fourth quarter of 2016.

For the year ended December 31, 2017, adjusted noninterest income 1 totaled $43.2 million, an increase of $6.3 million or 17% compared to the year ended December 31, 2016. During the quarter the Company sold $28.4 million of residential mortgages originated in prior quarters at a $477 thousand gross premium, recorded as mortgage banking fee income. Brokerage commissions and fees were impacted by a transition during the quarter to a new broker-dealer, and by the effects of Hurricane Irma. Looking forward, we expect the technology solution provided by the new broker-dealer to provide further opportunities for growth. A focus on spend stimulation in the quarter drove additional growth in debit interchange income. Net interest margin was 3.71% in the current quarter compared to 3.74% in the prior quarter and 3.56% in the fourth quarter of 2016. For the year ended December 31, 2017, the net interest margin was 3.73% compared to 3.63% for the year ended December 31, 2016. The net interest margin was affected this quarter when compared to the prior quarter by higher rates on deposits and lower non-cash related loan accretion. The provision for loan losses was $2.3 million compared to $0.7 million in the prior quarter and $1.0 million in the fourth quarter of 2016. The increase of $1.6 million in the current quarter primarily reflects the effect of higher charge-offs. As discussed in the hurricane update above, $0.6 million of the current quarter charge-offs related to a single borrower whose business exporting to the Caribbean was significantly impacted by the storms. For the year ended December 31, 2017, the provision for loan losses was $5.6 million compared to $2.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, primarily the result of organic growth in the portfolio. Noninterest expense was $39.2 million compared to $34.4 million in the prior quarter and $30.3 million in the fourth quarter of 2016. For the year ended December 31, 2017, noninterest expense was $150.0 million compared to $130.9 million in 2016. Adjusted noninterest expense 1 was $31.4 million compared to $32.8 million in the prior quarter, and $28.9 million in the fourth quarter of 2016. For the year ended December 31, 2017, adjusted noninterest expense 1 was $129.0 million compared to $114.2 million in 2016. The current quarter’s noninterest expense includes an adjustment of $2.0 million of performance related incentives, and merger and acquisition related charges totaling $6.8 million. The merger and acquisition related charges primarily represent change in control payments, legal fees and investment banking, and technology contract termination fees associated with the two acquisitions. Seacoast recorded a $20.4 million income tax provision in the current quarter, compared to $7.9 million in the prior quarter and $5.3 million in the fourth quarter of 2016. For the year ended December 31, 2017, the income tax provision was $36.3 million, compared to $14.9 million in 2016. This quarter’s tax provisioning included an $8.6 million charge for the write down of the company’s net deferred tax asset associated with the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017.

Full-year 2017 adjusted revenues 1 increased 24% compared to prior year results, while adjusted noninterest expense 1 increased 13%, providing 11% operating leverage.

In 2018, we’ll invest a portion of the tax savings associated with the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 to accelerate the achievement of these objectives.\nModernizing How We Sell\nThis year we continued our efforts to deepen customer relationships outside of our banking centers. The number of deposit accounts opened through our website and 24/7 customer support center grew by 12% year over year. Our Customer support center also originated $32.7 million in consumer and small business loans. Our Commercial Banking and Operations teams partnered to increase efficiency across the loan origination process with a focus on optimizing technology, improving cycle time, and enhancing vendor partnerships. This effort will continue well into 2018.\nLowering Our Cost to Serve\nCustomer adoption of more convenient digital channels continues to grow. This summer, non-teller transactions surpassed teller transactions and 41% of checks are now deposited outside of the banking center network, compared to 37% in December of 2016. We expect this shift in customer preference to continue, requiring continued focus on building a digitally integrated business model.\nDriving Improvements in How Our Business Operates\nThis year we successfully renegotiated our agreement with a key technology and digital services provider. The agreement expands digital banking capabilities, improves service level agreements, and increases our ability to scale. In November, we consolidated our customer support center in Stuart, migrating all customer support operations to our Orlando location. The modernized, expanded site supports our 24/7 customer service model and our growth strategy.\nScaling and Evolving Our Culture\nIn the first quarter of 2018, a Chief Technology Officer was added to the executive team. We also on-boarded key talent in the areas of data analysis, digital marketing, business-to-business marketing and compliance. These important additions to the Seacoast team help position us for future growth.\nOTHER INFORMATION\nConference Call Information\nSeacoast will host a conference call on Friday, January 26, 2018 at 10:00 a.m. (Eastern Time) to discuss the earnings results.

Management uses these non-GAAP financial measures in its analysis of the Company’s performance and believes these presentations provide useful supplemental information, and a clearer understanding of the Company’s performance. The Company believes the non-GAAP measures enhance investors’ understanding of the Company’s business and performance and if not provided would be requested by the investor community. These measures are also useful in understanding performance trends and facilitate comparisons with the performance of other financial institutions. The limitations associated with operating measures are the risk that persons might disagree as to the appropriateness of items comprising these measures and that different companies might calculate these measures differently. The Company provides reconciliations between GAAP and these non-GAAP measures. These disclosures should not be considered an alternative to GAAP.\nEffective in the first quarter of 2017, adjusted net income and adjusted noninterest expense exclude the effect of amortization of acquisition-related intangibles. Prior periods have been revised to conform with the current period presentation.\nQUARTER YTD (Dollars in thousands except per share data) Fourth Third Second First Fourth December 31, December 31, 2017 2017 2017 2017 2016 2017 2016 $ 13,047 $ 14,216 $ 7,676 $ 7,926 $ 10,771 $ 42,865 $ 29,202 Net income BOLI income (benefits upon death) 0 0 0 0 0 0 (464) Gain on Sale of Visa Class B Shares (15,153 ) 0 0 0 0 (15,153) 0 Security (gains) / losses (112 ) 47 (21) 0 (7) (86) (368) Total Adjustments to Revenue (15,265 ) 47 (21) 0 (7) (15,239) (832) Merger related charges 6,817 491 5,081 533 561 12,922 9,028 Amortization of intangibles 963 839 839 719 719 3,360 2,486 Business continuity expenses - Hurricane Irma 0 352 0 0 0 352 0 Branch reductions and other expense initiatives 0 (127) 1,876 2,572 163 4,321 3,357 Early redemption cost for FHLB advances 0 0 0 0 0 0 1,777 Total Adjustments to Noninterest Expense 7,780 1,555 7,796 3,824 1,443 20,955 16,648 Effective tax rate on adjustments 3,147 (673) (2,786) (1,480) (404) (1,792) (5,949) Effect of change in corporate tax rate 8,552 0 0 0 0 8,552 0 Adjusted Net Income $ 17,261 $ 15,145 $ 12,665 $ 10,270 $ 11,803 $ 55,341 $ 39,069 Earnings per diluted share, as reported 0.28 0.32 0.18 0.20 0.28 0.99 0.78 Adjusted Earnings per Diluted Share 0.37 0.35 0.29 0.26 0.31 1.28 1.04 Average shares outstanding (000) 46,673 43,792 43,556 39,499 38,252 43,350 37,508 Revenue $ 74,868 $ 57,183 $ 54,644 $ 48,070 $ 47,354 $ 234,765 $ 177,383 Total Adjustments to Revenue (15,265 ) 47 (21) 0 (7) (15,239) (832) Adjusted Revenue 59,603 57,230 54,623 48,070 47,347 219,526 176,551 Noninterest Expense 39,184 34,361 41,625 34,746 30,297 149,916 130,881 Total Adjustments to Noninterest Expense 7,780 1,555 7,796 3,824 1,443 20,955 16,648 Adjusted Noninterest Expense 31,404 32,806 33,829 30,922 28,854 128,961 114,233 Adjusted Noninterest Expense 31,404 32,806 33,829 30,922 28,854 128,961 114,233 Foreclosed property expense and net (gain)/loss on sale (7 ) (298) 297 (293) (78) (301) 43 Net Adjusted Noninterest Expense 31,411 33,104 33,532 31,215 28,932 129,262 114,190 Adjusted Revenue 59,603 57,230 54,623 48,070 47,347 219,526 176,551 Impact of FTE adjustment 174 154 164 211 204 703 204 Adjusted Revenue on a fully taxable equivalent basis 59,777 57,384 54,787 48,281 47,551 220,229 176,755 Adjusted Efficiency Ratio 52.6 % 57.7 % 61.2 % 64.7 % 60.8 % 58.7 % 64.6 % Average Assets $ 5,716,230 $ 5,316,119 $ 5,082,002 $ 4,699,745 $ 4,572,188 $ 5,206,617 $ 4,201,819 Less average goodwill and intangible assets (149,432 ) (118,364) (114,563) (78,878) (79,620) (115,511) (66,608) Average Tangible Assets 5,566,798 5,197,755 4,967,439 4,620,867 4,492,568 5,091,106 4,135,211 Return on Average Assets (ROA) 0.91 % 1.06 % 0.61 % 0.68 % 0.94 % 0.82 % 0.69 % Impact of removing average intangible assets and related amortization 0.06 0.06 0.05 0.06 0.06 0.06 0.05 Return on Tangible Average Assets (ROTA) 0.97 1.12 0.66 0.74 1.00 0.88 0.74 Impact of other adjustments for Adjusted Net Income 0.26 0.04 0.36 0.16 0.05 0.21 0.20 Adjusted Return on Average Tangible Assets 1.23 1.16 1.02 0.90 1.05 1.09 0.94 Average Shareholders' Equity $ 657,100 $ 587,919 $ 567,448 $ 466,847 $ 437,077 $ 570,399 $ 406,084 Less average goodwill and intangible assets (149,432 ) (118,364) (114,563) (78,878) (79,620) (115,511) (66,608) Average Tangible Equity 507,668 469,555 452,885 387,969 357,457 454,888 339,476 Return on Average Shareholders' Equity 7.9 % 9.6 % 5.4 % 6.9 % 9.8 % 7.5 % 7.2 % Impact of removing average intangible assets and related amortization 2.8 2.9 1.9 1.9 2.7 2.4 1.9 Return on Average Tangible Common Equity (ROTCE) 10.7 12.5 7.3 8.8 12.5 9.9 9.1 Impact of other adjustments for Adjusted Net Income 2.8 0.3 3.9 1.9 0.6 2.3 2.4 Adjusted Return on Average Tangible Common Equity 13.5 12.8 11.2 10.7 13.1 12.2 11.5 Please visit Seacoast Bank’s website for a PDF version of this press release and information on the 4th Quarter 2017 Earnings Conference Call: http://www.seacoastbanking.com/presentations.aspx?iid=100425\nSource:Seacoast Banking Corporation of Florida", "external_links": ["https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=i53QHLhAPRbT9vMc1BeY7XYRWnupKaApRlu-VL3J_NRb5nLPUht4ZM4YWrI-wII113EHBLJZ-1DAa82u8CRvQw==", "http://www.seacoastbanking.com/presentations.aspx?iid=100425", "https://www.globenewswire.com/NewsRoom/AttachmentNg/916ac304-654b-498a-851d-f52d3ce65a03", "https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=i53QHLhAPRbT9vMc1BeY7bU_RWZaBAshoGRDPGCsaGwtNYQuotHWu93tZSy-P-qMWC0v6EPgo2O3-l7DK0NcdEN-AjgDjX8C3toKKQzs-miSiRLIde1MeCbDdSv7IYyAHvqz97H5KTPyx3UTfWdnWdPnmVrQuFVLA5THei72-SZWKBvMvWsOH1rXe0zOeaiR"], "published": "2018-01-26T00:05:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-26T02:54:08.003+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
