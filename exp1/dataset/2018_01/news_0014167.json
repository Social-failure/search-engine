On Wednesday, France urged the immediate release of the pair, saying: “Journalists must be able to exercise their profession freely, without fear of being intimidated or arrested.”\nThe EU highlighted that the Reuters journalists had been arrested a month ago in connection with reporting on the situation in Rakhine state where hundreds of thousands of Rohingya Muslims have fled a military crackdown on militants.\n“The EU reiterates its call on the Myanmar government to ensure transparency and to make serious efforts in order to hold accountable all those involved in serious human rights abuses in the context of the ongoing crisis in Rakhine state,” it said.\nIn the European Parliament, liberal leader Guy Verhofstadt, a former prime minister of Belgium, called on the EU authorities to be ready to follow up words with action against Myanmar.\n“Using outdated laws to jail reporters covering (the) Rohingya crisis is grotesque and unjust,” Verhofstadt tweeted. “Good to see condemnation from EU envoys but further action should follow if fundamental rights continue to be violated.” (Additional reporting by Alastair Macdonald; Editing by Richard Balmforth)\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-01-10T19:41:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-11T12:34:27.027+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
