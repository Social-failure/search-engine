Some refugee leaders said Bangladesh military officials had threatened to seize their food ration cards if they did not return. \nUnder an agreement signed last week, Myanmar is set to receive Rohingya refugees from Bangladesh at two reception centres and a temporary camp near their common border starting on Tuesday and continuing over the next two years. \nThe refugees refuse to go back unless their safety can be guaranteed and Myanmars grant their demands to be given citizenship and inclusion in a list of recognised ethnic minorities. They are also asking that their homes, mosques and schools that were burned down or damaged in the military operation be rebuilt. \nOver 655,500 Muslim Rohingya fled to Bangladesh after the Myanmar military cracked down in the northern part of Rakhine state in response to militant attacks on security forces on Aug. 25. The United Nations described the operation as ethnic cleansing of the Rohingya, which Myanmar denies. \nRohingya elders told Reuters that Bangladeshi army officials have called or met them over the last two days, asking them to prepare lists of families from their camps for repatriation. Four of them said they were among more than 70 camp leaders – representing thousands of refugees – who met army officers at the Gungdum camp on Saturday.

These centres are managed by the Bangladesh army. \nThe United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) has repeatedly said Rohingya returns need to be voluntary. \n“UNHCR has not been part of discussions (on repatriation) to date, but has offered support to engage in the process to ensure that the voices of refugees are heard,” Caroline Gluck, a senior protection officer for the agency, said by email on Saturday. \n“The pace of returns should be determined by the refugees themselves.” Editing by Raju Gopalakrishnan", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-21T12:29:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-21T12:44:27.009+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
