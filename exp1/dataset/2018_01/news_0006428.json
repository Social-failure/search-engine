Trump’s primary residence was in the building before his election victory and inauguration nearly a year ago. \nOne firefighter was hospitalised with nonlife-threatening injuries, while two people received minor injuries that were treated at the scene, including a building worker whose injury was initially described as serious, the Fire Department said. \nEric Trump, one of the president’s sons, said on Twitter that it was a small electrical fire in the cooling tower on the building’s roof. \n“The New York Fire Department was here within minutes and did an incredible job,” said the younger Trump. “The men and women of the #FDNY are true heros and deserve our most sincere thanks and praise!” \nThe Fire Department said the fire was not inside the building, but on top of it.

No smoke condition or fire was on the inside,” Manhattan Borough Commander Assistant Chief Roger Sakowich said on Twitter. \nThe cause of the blaze is being investigated by the city fire marshal, a department spokesman said.
