The odds of picking the right six numbers for the Mega Millions jackpot are 303 million to 1, the game said.\n“When the jackpots reach these levels, everyone starts to daydream about what they would do if they won,” Gordon Medenica, Mega Millions lead director, said in a statement.\nReporting by Chris Kenning in Chicago; Editing by Lisa Shumaker\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-05T21:56:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-05T22:09:06.023+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
