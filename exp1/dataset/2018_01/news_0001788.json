Officials from the two Koreas may urgently meet to discuss the possibility,” Kim said. \nSouth Korea said it welcomed Kim’s offer to send a delegation to the Pyeongchang Games and hold talks with the South to discuss possible participation. \n“We have always stated our willingness to talk with North Korea anytime and anywhere if that would help restore inter-Korean relations and lead to peace on the Korean peninsula,” a spokesman for the presidential Blue House said. \n“We hope the two Koreas will sit down and find a solution to lower tensions and establish peace on the Korean peninsula.” \nLee Hee-beom, president of the Pyeongchang Organizing Committee, said the organisation welcomed North Korean participation. \n“The (organising committee) will discuss relevant matters with the South Korean government as well as the International Olympic Committee,” he said in a statement. \nSouth Korean President Moon Jae-in has said North Korea’s participation will ensure the safety of the Pyeongchang Olympics and proposed last month that Seoul and Washington postpone large military drills that the North denounces as a rehearsal for war until after the Games. \nU.S.-based experts saw Kim’s speech as a clear attempt to divide South Korea from its main ally, the United States, which has led an international campaign to pressure North Korea to give up weapons programs aimed at developing nuclear missiles capable of hitting the United States. \nAsked by reporters to comment on Kim’s speech, U.S. President Donald Trump simply said, “we’ll see, we’ll see”, as he walked into New Year’s Eve celebration at Mar-a-Lago, his elite resort in Florida. \nThe U.S. State Department did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Kim’s New Year’s address. \n“This speech pokes at the fissure that has lain below the surface in U.S.-South Korean relations, and seems designed to drive a wedge there,” said Douglas Paal, a former senior U.S. diplomat who heads the Asia program at Washington’s Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. \n“Seoul’s President Moon needs a successful Olympics and the U.S. drive to increase pressure fits poorly with the Southern agenda.” \nEvans Revere, another former senior U.S. diplomat who has taken part in unofficial talks with North Korean officials this year, said North Korea was likely to try to extract concessions as a “price” for Olympics participation. \n“It’s hard to imagine Seoul falling for this,” he said, adding that Seoul and Washington had so far stayed in synch in the pressure and isolation campaign. \nRevere said Kim Jong Un’s speech contained the strongest defence of North Korea’s status as a permanently nuclear-armed country he had seen.

That’s not a basis on which the United States is prepared to engage,” he said. \nMoon took office in May last year pledging to engage Pyongyang in dialogue and restore ties strained after nearly a decade of conservative rule in the South. \nBut North Korea has so far snubbed his overtures, including an offer to hold inter-Korean military talks about ceasing hostile activities along the border, as it tested missiles at an unprecedented pace. \nRather than encouraging U.S. measures that “threaten the security and peace of the Korean peninsula,” Seoul should instead respond to overtures from the North, and “stop nuclear war exercises with foreign forces,” Kim said. \n“REALITY, NOT A THREAT” \nNorth Korea conducted its sixth and most powerful nuclear test in September in defiance of international warnings and sanctions, raising fears of a new conflict on the Korean peninsula.
