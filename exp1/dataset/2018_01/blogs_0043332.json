The world is changing too fast, you have to have really smart people who can educate you from a high level perspective, so you can determine the best strategy and then let them go.\"\n\"When you make decisions as a team, and ultimately strive towards a same goal, make sure you also celebrate those victories. I think too often in big rapidly-evolving companies, you don't take the time to celebrate or to show your appreciation to your team — and that can be detrimental.\"\nChallenge the status quo Meanwhile, her father and current CEO of WWE, Vince McMahon has a frequent expression he uses: \"Treat every day like it's your first day on the job.\" So for Stephanie this means people should challenge the status quo.\n\"Every single day — just because something has been done one way for a long time, doesn't mean that it can't be done better,\" McMahon adds, echoing 14-time WWE World Heavyweight Champion and husband Triple H's own thoughts in a recent interview with CNBC.\n\"Just because you've done something this way and it's been successful, doesn't mean it's still the right way,\" Paul Michael Levesque, better known as Triple H, told CNBC in November .\n\"Relook at it and if there's a different way to do it, be willing to say 'I'm going to forget about all of this and I'm going to take that risk again and I'm going to put all my chips on the table and I'm going to gamble on myself.'\"\nLife Hacks Live is a series produced by CNBC International for Facebook, where tomorrow's leaders get to ask some of the world's biggest influencers for advice.
