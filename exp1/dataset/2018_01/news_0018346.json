Israel confirmed the attack immediately after, but gave no details until Sunday.\nThere was no immediate comment from Hamas or Egypt, or any reports of casualties.\nIsrael says it has developed new means which it has declined to disclose, to find tunnels. Defence Minister Avigdor Lieberman lauded the breakthrough in an interview on commercial television news, saying they would all be destroyed by the end of the year.\n“By the end of 2018, we will eliminate all the Hamas attack tunnels ... we may even manage to do this sooner, but the task is to destroy them all by the end of the year,” Lieberman said.\nTensions have risen since President Donald Trump reversed decades of U.S. policy on Dec. 6 by recognizing Jerusalem as Israel’s capital. Gaza militants have launched 18 cross-border rockets or mortar bombs, causing no fatalities or serious injuries in Israel, and 15 protesters and two gunmen have been killed by Israeli fire.\nThe attacks from Gaza, which Israel has blamed on groups not affiliated with Hamas, have drawn Israeli air strikes, usually on targets that have been evacuated.\n“There are those who say the Israeli military attacks sand dunes - that is incorrect,” Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, addressing criticism from lawmakers who have called for a stronger armed response, told reporters after the tunnel was targeted.\nA Palestinian rides a motorcycle outside Kerem Shalom, the main passage point for goods entering Gaza, after it was shut down by Israel, in the southern Gaza Strip January 14, 2018. REUTERS/Ibraheem Abu Mustafa Netanyahu cautioned Hamas that Israel “will respond with even greater force” if rocket strikes continue. Israel has said Hamas, as the dominant force in Gaza, bears overall responsibility for any attacks from the enclave.\nBut Yoav Galant, a member of Netanyahu’s security cabinet, said on Army Radio that Israel is “not looking for confrontation with Hamas”. Nonetheless, he said Israel “could not abide by a situation in which Israelis are harmed by fire (from Gaza)”.\nColonel Jonathan Conricus, an Israeli military spokesman, described the target hit on Saturday as 1.5 km (one mile)-lone “terror tunnel” running the Kerem Shalom border crossing into Israel, and into Egypt.\nPalestinian security forces loyal to Hamas stand guard near the border between Egypt and Gaza, in the southern Gaza Strip January 14, 2018. REUTERS/Ibraheem Abu Mustafa “It could also have served to transfer terrorists from the Gaza Strip into Egypt in order to attack Israeli targets from Egypt,” he said.\nKerem Shalom, the main passage point for goods entering Gaza, was shut down on Saturday before the Israeli attack.\nUnderground tunnels are used to smuggle in all manner of commercial goods to Gaza, and to bring in weapons for militants from Hamas and other groups. They have also been used by Hamas to launch attacks inside Israel.\nDuring the last Gaza war, in 2014, Hamas fighters used dozens of tunnels to blindside Israel’s superior forces.\nThe Israeli military said it has destroyed three tunnels in the past two months.\nIsrael has been constructing a sensor-equipped underground wall along the 60-km (36-mile) Gaza border, aiming to complete the $1.1 billion project by mid-2019.\nAdditional reporting by Ori Lewis, Editing by Jeffrey Heller, Raissa Kasolowsky and David Evans\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-14T09:37:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-14T09:44:17.072+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
