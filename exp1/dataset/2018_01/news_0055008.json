DeMarre Carroll had 13 points to lead five Nets who scored in double figures.\nIn sweeping the Nets for the first time since 2010-11, New York held Brooklyn to 41.9 percent shooting from the field and 25 percent shooting from behind the 3-point arc.\nPorzingis, who is averaging 23 points for the season but just 20 in the month of January, had his highest scoring output in more than two weeks, helping the Knicks get off to a big lead. He sank six 3-pointers on eight attempts.\nNew York led 61-41 at halftime as it shot 50 percent from 3-point range and 80 percent from the free-throw line. The Knicks led by 25 at one point and were only threatened when the Nets trimmed it to 10, but Brooklyn got no closer.\nKanter’s 20 points came on 8-of-10 shooting, and Tim Hardaway Jr. added 15 points for the Knicks, whose starters outscored the Nets’ 77-56. Courtney Lee and Michael Beasley added 12 points apiece for the Knicks.\nNew York had 22 assists for the game and just 11 turnovers, though Brooklyn won the battle of the glass, 49-47, behind Jahlil Okafor’s 13 rebounds off the bench.\nJarrett Allen, Allen Crabbe and Nik Stauskas each had 12 points for the Nets, who lost for the 10th time in 13 games. Spencer Dinwiddie added 11 points and seven assists.\nBrooklyn hosts the Philadelphia 76ers on Wednesday, while the Knicks travel to Boston on Wednesday for a matchup with the Celtics.\n--Field Level Media\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-01-31T11:41:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-31T16:51:38.017+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
