Somewhere between 2.5 and 2.7 would be very good\" on average over the next three or four years.\nMany current projections call for at least a 3 percent gross domestic product advance in the fourth quarter of 2017, including CNBC's Rapid Update and Atlanta Federal Reserve's latest GDPNow forecast.

I hope we do grow at a higher rate. But I just don't think we will,\" he said, noting the population is aging with more baby boomers retiring.\nWATCH: CNBC's full interview with billionaire David Rubenstein show chapters Carlyle Group's David Rubenstein: I would not have recommended this tax bill to Congress 5 Hours Ago | 09:42", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-23T16:43:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-23T16:53:13.009+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
