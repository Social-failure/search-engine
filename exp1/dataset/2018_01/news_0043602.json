It fears the emergence of a rival further to the right, but it does not want to alienate more centrist voters. \nIt condemned displays of racism and anti-Semitism organised by far-right groups at a November march, for example, but it did not condemn the march itself, saying most of the marchers were “patriots”. \nOpposition lawmaker Slawomir Nitras, a member of the centrist Civic Platform (PO), which lost power to PiS in 2015, accused the government on Thursday of emboldening the far-right. \nOne example given by opposition lawmakers was that the prosecutor’s office, brought under direct government control by PiS, has appealed the conviction of a man who burned a Jewish effigy in Wroclaw in 2015. \n“You are spreading hate, downplaying the problem, feeding the monster that has now grown,” said lawmaker Katarzyna Lubnauer from the Nowoczesna party. “Now, full of hypocrisy, you are pretending that you fight this.” \nSpreading totalitarian ideologies like Nazism or communism is punishable by jail in Poland, a country that was invaded both by Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union during World War Two, then dominated by the Soviets after the war.
