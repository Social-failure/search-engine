Other expected listings include Lufax, the wealth management platform backed by insurance group Ping An .\nLufax, China's largest online wealth management platform, is expected to sell $6 billion to $9 billion of shares in its IPO, and is seeking a valuation of $60 billion, the South China Morning Post reported on Monday.\nIn all, bankers anticipate tech companies worth up to $500 billion could seek IPOs in Hong Kong or New York over the next two years, encouraged by investor enthusiasm for recent tech floats and buoyant stock markets.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-15T08:38:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-15T08:39:01.064+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
