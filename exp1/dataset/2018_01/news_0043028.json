While Alibaba Group Holding Ltd and U.S. grocer Kroger Co have had early discussions on working together, a source familiar with the matter said.\nE-MART EDGE E-Mart’s growth has helped department store operator Shinsegae, relatively new to e-commerce, notch up double-digit increases in online sales in recent years.\nBy 2023, Shinsegae has said it wants to boost annual online sales five-fold to 10 trillion won ($9.4 billion) and become South Korea’s No. 1 e-commerce firm. Currently, eBay ’s South Korea’s units lead the online shopping market.\nUnder the deal, the two firms will spin off and combine their online business units to launch a separate company this year. The private equity firms will invest 1 trillion won by either purchasing new shares or by other methods, Shinsegae said in a statement.\nA Shinsegae spokesman said the latest funding could help finance potential acquisitions of other online firms in the longer term.\nSeo at Shinyoung Investment said Shinsegae’s online business had broken even in the second half of 2017, even as other rivals like SoftBank-backed Coupang are still suffering from huge losses because of razor-thin margins.\nOnline grocers in South Korea have an advantage over competitors in other countries as about half of the country’s population resides in Seoul and its surrounding areas.\nE-Mart is likely to grab the lion’s share of the market given that firms need substantive logistics infrastructure to maintain freshness, creating a high entry barrier for newcomers, Hana Investment & Securities said in a report this month.\n($1 = 1,063.8000 won)\nReporting by Hyunjoo Jin; Editing by Edwina Gibbs\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-26T05:26:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-26T06:00:45.004+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
