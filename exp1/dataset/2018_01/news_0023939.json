UEFA said their yield of 97.8 euros per spectator was the highest in Europe, followed by Chelsea, Real Madrid, Liverpool, Bayern Munich, Manchester United, Barcelona, Galatasaray, Manchester City and West Ham United.\n(This version of the story was corrected to say billion in the third paragraph)\nEditing by Ed Osmond\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-17T00:41:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-17T01:05:43.012+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
