We are in favour of ensuring strong convergence of rules and supervision in the EU and the UK. We are enhancing EU rules on equivalence, which is an important tool under EU law to ensure such convergence.” \nEU negotiators see no room for discussion with Britain on maintaining “passport” access to EU financial markets for its banks, diplomats in Brussels said earlier this week. \nThat would leave finance executives relying on what it known as equivalence, a legal mechanism that allows countries from outside the bloc to access the single market in limited circumstances.
