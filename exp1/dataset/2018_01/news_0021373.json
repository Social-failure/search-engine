The German industrial conglomerate reiterated on Tuesday the listing was planned for the first half of 2018.\nSiemens Healthineers said in a statement on Tuesday: \"Structural cost savings initiatives are targeting 240 million euros of cost savings per year with a first full impact visible in 2020, and the company aims to achieve continuous productivity improvements going forward.\"\nThe maker of medical gear such as X-ray and MRI machines expects an adjusted operating profit margin of 17-18 percent for 2018 and comparable revenue growth of 3-4 percent, it said ahead of an event for analysts and investors.\nThat compares with 18.1 percent in the fiscal year to September, while comparable revenue growth was 3 percent.\nOver the medium term the business expects organic revenue growth to speed up to 4-6 percent, led by products such as automated lab diagnostic gear or software to help physicians interpret medical images.\nAnalysts have said they would be looking for clues on how Siemens plans to turn around the underperforming In-Vitro diagnostics business, which provides lab machinery to analyse blood, tissue or urine samples.\nThe group said that business's profit margin would improve to 16-19 percent over the medium term, up from 14 percent last year.\nMichael Sen, Siemens board member in charge of Healthineers, said the unit would act independently but it would remain part of the parent group in the long term.\n\"We will actively accompany that development as a long-term shareholder.\" ($1 = 0.8174 euros)\n(Reporting by Ludwig Burger; Editing by Georgina Prodhan and Adrian Croft)", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-16T18:53:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-16T22:55:33.006+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
