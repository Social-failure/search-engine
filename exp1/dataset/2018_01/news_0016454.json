Donatella is artistic director and vice president of the privately held fashion company.\n“I don’t know if she (Donatella) is going to watch the show, but if she did I think that she would see that we treat her and her family with respect and kindness,” Murphy told Variety on Tuesday night.\nDirector Ryan Murphy participates in a panel for the FX Networks \"The People v.

I think that she really loves Penelope and knows that Penelope would never do anything to represent her in a negative light,” Murphy said.\nScreenwriter Tom Rob Smith said the series aimed to be truthful in its spirit, even if it gets some details wrong.\n“The show is full of love for him (Versace),” Smith said. “I‘m sure there are points where (the family) could correct some of the smaller details, but I think the bigger picture is that this is a figure that we’re celebrating and a figure that we all fell in love with.”\nReporting by Jill Serjeant; Editing by Lisa Shumaker\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-01-10T06:25:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-10T00:37:30.066+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
