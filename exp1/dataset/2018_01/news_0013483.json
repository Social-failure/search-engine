No problem, says Sweden great Forsberg Philip O'Connor 3 Min Read \nSTOCKHOLM (Reuters) - There may be no National Hockey League (NHL) players on show in Pyeongchang but two-time Olympic ice hockey gold medalist Peter Forsberg still expects a great Olympic ice hockey tournament. \nAnd if anyone knows about making the most of the NHL’s absence from the Games, it is Forsberg - the last time the league declined to allow its players to take part, he and his Swedish teammates won gold in Lillehammer in 1994. \n“I don’t think you’re going to sit there back home and think ‘this is not a good hockey game.’ I think they’re going to be great hockey games,” Forsberg, 44, told Reuters in an interview. \nForsberg, who went on to win two Stanley Cups in a glittering NHL career, was speaking at an event hosted by Eurosport, where he will be a cornerstone of their Olympic hockey coverage next month. \nWith no pros from North America, the Olympic squads will now mostly be drawn from the European and Russian professional hockey leagues. The Russian team, competing under a neutral flag due to the ban on formal Russian participation imposed over doping violations, are considered favorites for the gold medal. \n“I was a little disappointed in the beginning, but now I‘m kind of over it,” he said of the NHL’s decision not to allow its players to take part.
