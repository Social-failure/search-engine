LOW RISK \nAn update of the rules should come into force this year at the end of a legislative procedure involving the three main EU political bodies: Parliament, Commission and Council. \nPeter Simon, a German MEP in charge of the legislative procedure for the rules in Strasbourg, has already endorsed Italy’s proposal. \n“This amendment should take into account the low risk of these exposures which have a considerably lower default probability,” said Simon in a report to the EU Parliament published in November. \nUnder CRR rules, salary-secured loans currently carry a risk weighting of 75 percent - the higher the weighting, the more capital required. The ABI wants the weighting cut to 35 percent. \nAccording to industry sources, this would enable Italian lenders to free up at least 850 million euros of capital. \nOn the top of this, the lenders would gain further savings from January 2019 when the Minimum Requirement for own funds and Eligible Liabilities (MREL) will comes into force to increase the loss-absorbing capacity of EU banks. \nIn Italy, about 1.2 million borrowers have salary-secured loans that are limited to a fifth of salary or pension, insured and repayable over 10 years in installments. \nSome banks are discouraged from writing them because of the relatively high capital cost. \n“A bank must control at least 5 percent of this market for lending to be profitable,” said Franco Masera, president of Rome-based IBL Bank. \nHalf of Italian salary-secured loans are controlled by a handful of banks. IBL has written 17 percent of them, followed by BNL, a unit of BNP Paribas, as well as UniCredit , Compass, a unit of Mediobanca, and Banca Sistema. \n“Around a 20 percent of our assets are salary and pension backed loans. With this amendment we would halve the capital needed to back them,” said Gianluca Garbi, Banca Sistema’s CEO. $1 = 0.8146 euros Reporting by Stefano Bernabei; Editing by Mark Potter", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-18T10:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-18T10:19:47.009+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
