The trading system developed a technical issue at 2:31 p.m. (0731 GMT) on Monday which prevented it from retrieving a closing price for the index, local media reported.\nWithout the closing point as reference for the next trading day, the State Securities Commission has allowed the exchange to halt Tuesday’s trading, local media said, citing a statement from the exchange.\nThe Hanoi-based derivative market was functioning as normal, the SSC said.
