Officials with the Federal Bureau of Investigation could not immediately be reached. \nRussian cyber security firm Group IB has reported that cyber criminals remotely attacked cash machines in more than a dozen countries across Europe in 2016 using malicious software that forces machines to spit out cash. Similar attacks were also reported that year in Thailand and Taiwan. \nDiebold Nixdorf’s alert said that the hackers were targeting a model in its line of ATMs, known as the Opteva, which the company stopped making several years ago but is still used by some banks. \nThe company believes that the same approach would not work on other models, Jacobsen said. \nThe alert described steps that banks can take to prevent against such attacks.
