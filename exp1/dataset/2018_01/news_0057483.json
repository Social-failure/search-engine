The Nevada Gaming Control Board will conduct its investigation in a thorough and judicious manner,\" the board's chair, Becky Harris, said in a statement.\nThe allegations, which were first reported Friday, detailed accounts from dozens of current and former employees that would amount to \"a decades-long pattern of sexual misconduct,\" as well as a $7.5 million financial settlement paid to a manicurist who alleged she was pressured into having sex with Wynn.\nWynn has denied the allegations.\nShares of Wynn Resorts have plunged since the report was published Friday, as attention has turned to how the company's board leadership will manage what could amount to a civil liability.\nWynn Resorts on Friday said its board of directors had formed a committee to look into the allegations , although Wynn will continue to act as CEO for the duration of the investigation.\nRNC Chair Ronna Romney-McDaniel confirmed that Wynn resigned on Saturday from his post as the RNC's finance chief.\nChicago Cubs co-owner and Republican donor Todd Ricketts is expected to succeed Wynn as RNC finance chair.\nThis story is developing.
