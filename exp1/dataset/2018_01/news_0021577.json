The Italian carmaker has been skeptical of all-electric supercars, but does sell cars with hybrid engines. SHARES Getty Images Sergio Marchionne, Chief Executive Officer, Fiat Chrysler Automobiles is viewed next to a Ferrari after ringing the Closing Bell on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) on October 13, 2014 in New York City. \nFerrari plans to make a high-end electric car, said CEO Sergio Marchionne on Tuesday. \nThe auto executive, who also heads Fiat-Chrysler , told reporters at the North American International Auto Show that whatever Tesla has done with high-end electrics can be done by others in the industry. \nThe plan would be a significant change of direction for Marchionne and Ferrari. While the Italian carmaker equips some cars with hybrid technology, Marchionne once called the idea of a completely electric Ferrari \" almost an obscene concept .\" \nSome Ferrari fans would agree. An all-electric Ferrari, without a brash-sounding internal combustion engine the cars are known for, would be about as appealing as a \"3-D printed soy donut,\" said one owner . That means to some purists, such a car might look like a Ferrari, but would not really be one. \nBut Tesla's high-performance P100D versions of is Model S and Model X cars deliver eye-popping performance and generate buzz among customers. Furthermore, in November, Tesla unveiled a second-generation Roadster the company said will go zero to 60 miles per hour in a record 1.9 seconds. \nâ€”CNBC's Silvia Berzoni contributed to this story .
