(NYSE: ZAYO) today announced that it has acquired Vancouver-based Optic Zoo Networks for CAD $31 million. Optic Zoo owns and operates high-capacity fiber in Vancouver and has achieved a significant penetration of customers, with a focus on the digital media sector.\nThe transaction strengthens Zayo’s position in Vancouver and Western Canada, adding 103 route miles and more than 100 on-net buildings to Zayo’s Vancouver footprint. The acquisition will deepen Zayo’s customer base, providing the ability to cross sell to a diverse group of U.S. and Canadian customers. Optic Zoo’s high-count fiber, 270 on average, has ample capacity for new and existing customers.\nThe third largest city in Canada, Vancouver is a global gateway and Canadian business hub. The city is a growing center for digital media and film, professional services, biotechnology and software development, all large consumers of bandwidth.\n“The addition of Optic Zoo, with its pure play assets and innovative team, will complement our Canadian footprint and accelerate our traction in a rapidly growing media and technology hub,” said Jack Waters, CTO and president of Fiber Solutions at Zayo. “Optic Zoo has built a strong and growing business, attracted an impressive customer base and delivered revenue growth rates of more than 20 percent.”\nAll of Optic Zoo’s revenue aligns with Zayo’s infrastructure-focused business segments, with the majority classified as fiber solutions. Optic Zoo is expected to generate CAD $1.9M in annualized EBITDA for the quarter ended March 31, 2018.
