It was filed against a Netherlands-based affiliate, Universal International Music BV. \nUniversal did not immediately respond to a request for comment. \nIglesias, 42, whose father is Spanish singer Julio Iglesias, began his recording career in 1995, and according to the complaint has sold more than 100 million albums and generated billions of streams. \nUniversal became Enrique Iglesias’ home label in 1999, and he remained there until departing for Sony Music in 2015. \nThough streaming did not exist in 1999, Iglesias said his contract, which was modified in 2010, called for the 50 percent royalty rate “for any type of use not specifically covered” by its terms. \nIn a statement, Iglesias’ lawyer James Sammataro accused Universal of distorting the contract’s meaning so that “it alone” could reap the savings from digital streams. \n“This is not what Enrique’s contract, or the contracts of many other artists, call for,” Sammataro said. “Artists, producers and songwriters should benefit from the reduced costs of streaming.” Reporting by Jonathan Stempel in New York; Editing by Andrew Hay", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-24T23:18:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-24T23:43:21.001+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
