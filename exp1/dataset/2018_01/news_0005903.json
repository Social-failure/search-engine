Above 50 indicates expansion and below shows a contraction.\nOutput growth fell sharply last month to 60.7 from 64.3 but remained strong by historical standards, while growth in new orders rose sharply to a 35-month high of 64.8 from 60.1.\nEmployment continued to grow at the same moderate pace.\n“The UAE’s non-oil sector expanded sharply in the last two months of the year, largely due to a strong rise in output and new orders,” said Khatija Haque, head of regional research at Emirates NBD.\n”It is likely that the introduction of VAT in January has spurred activity and purchasing in the fourth quarter of 2017,\nwhich is in line with our expectations. Nevertheless, employment and wage growth have been relatively muted, not just in December but for 2017 as a whole.”\nOutput price inflation was negative for a fourth straight month in December, while input price inflation slowed slightly.\nReporting by Andrew Torchia; Editing by Hugh Lawson\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-01-04T12:26:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-04T07:55:26.012+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
