The difference now is U.S. troops are now coming to the ramparts.\" \nAsked whether the U.S. was about to impose more trade tariffs and whether he was afraid of starting a trade war, Ross said trade wars were common. \n\"Trade wars are fought every single day. Unfortunately, every single day there are various parties violating the rules and taking advantage,\" he said. \nRoss was speaking alongside Homeland Security Adviser Tom Bossert and U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, who said that a weaker dollar was good for the U.S. and that the country was committed to free trade. \nRoss' comments come as global leaders appeared to criticize the U.S.' decision Monday to impose trade tariffs on solar cell imports from China. \nOpening the WEF annual meeting Tuesday, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi said protectionism and isolationism were negative for the global economy . U.S. President Donald Trump is due to give a speech in Davos on Friday; he is expected to promote his \"America First\" policy.
