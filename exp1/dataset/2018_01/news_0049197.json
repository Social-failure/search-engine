Ryder said it could set up a commission of inquiry to make recommendations to ensure Venezuela meets its obligations under the ILO convention on the freedom of association. \nFedecamaras has long been at odds with Maduro’s government and played a major role against the government of his predecessor, Hugo Chavez, in 2002, when its head briefly became interim president.
