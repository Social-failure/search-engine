How can the company earn money now?” the trader asked. “The one indication they currently have for Raxone is certainly not enough to justify the price level.”\nWidening potential indications for Raxone is a big hope for Santhera. The drug generated all the group’s revenues of 19 million francs in 2016, a 340 percent increase from the prior year.\nSanthera said it plans to give a further update on Friday.\n$1 = 0.9497 Swiss francs Reporting by John Revill and Rupert Pretterklieber, editing by Louise Heavens and Michael Shields\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-01-24T22:23:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-25T13:17:50.019+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
