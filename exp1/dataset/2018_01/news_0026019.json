India celebrate after Mohammed Shami took the wicket of South Africa’s AB De Villiers. REUTERS/James Oatway \nIndia are chasing 287 for victory to square the three-match series, but that looks a long way off on a wicket providing extreme variable bounce. \nCheteshwar Pujara (11) and Parthiv Patel (five) will resume on the final day, trying to find a way to score runs against a fired-up home seam attack getting plenty of assistance from the pitch. \nKohli, who scored a brilliant 153 in the first innings, would have been key to India’s plans in the run chase, but he was trapped lbw for five by an excellent delivery from Ngidi that came back into him sharply and kept low. \nNgidi, 21, had earlier bagged the wicket of opener Lokesh Rahul for four with his first delivery of the day, a loosener the batsman carved straight to Keshav Maharaj at point. \nMurali Vijay (nine) was the first batsman to fall, bowled by Kagiso Rabada from another ball that kept low.
