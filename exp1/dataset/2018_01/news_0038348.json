The deal began in January 2017.\nSaudi Energy Minister Khalid al-Falih said rebalancing the market might not take place until 2019, suggesting it would take longer than OPEC has previously indicated.\nGlobal economic growth was also helping prices by driving up demand.\nshow chapters Crude oil at $60 and over will not last, Kilduff says 3:32 PM ET Fri, 19 Jan 2018 | 01:42 \"Global growth has become synchronised and accelerated above trend,\" U.S. bank Morgan Stanley said in a note.\nBernstein Energy said oil inventories might start rising soon due to a slowdown in demand that typically happens at the end of the northern hemisphere winter.\n\"With the strong correlation between inventories and crude prices, this perhaps means we should expect crude prices to moderate in the near term,\" Bernstein said.\nBut a drop in the number of U.S. drilling rigs, an indicator of future output, offered some support. U.S. drillers cut five rigs in the week to Jan. 19, reducing the count to 747.\nDespite the cuts, the rig count in 2017 and early this year remains much higher than in 2016, resulting in a 16-percent rise in U.S. crude oil production since mid-2016, to 9.75 million barrels per day (bpd).", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-22T04:11:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-22T03:27:04.020+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
