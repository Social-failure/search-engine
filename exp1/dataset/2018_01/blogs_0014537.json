More livestreamed games will be available next season, including preseason, Thursday Night Football, Sunday Night Football, Monday Night Footbal, local market games and playoff matches. \nVerizon has been moving more into the media business, especially through key AOL and Yahoo acquisitions. The company also offers Go90 , a millennial-targeted mobile streaming platform. It's been rumored to be preparing its own over-the-top service (OTT), which would allow customers to watch content without a cable or satellite subscription. Verizon will do more service and partnership deals to bring more content to mobile consumers, Armstrong said. \n\"The movement in the world is for consumers to go mobile,\" he said.\nThe NFL and Verizon deal fits with that strategy, with Armstrong saying it was one of the first big \"building blocks.\" The two announced the multiyear partnership in December, saying customers and Oath site users — which include Yahoo Sports, Yahoo and AOL — would be able to stream football games . Previously only Verizon customers could watch livestreamed mobile games. The deal reportedly cost Verizon more than $1.5 billion over five years. \n- Additional reporting by Julia Boorstin", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-09T17:44:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-09T17:58:43.016+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
