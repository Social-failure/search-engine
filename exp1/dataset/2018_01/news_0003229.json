For a young man to apply himself and absorb himself in the environment as he has, is exactly what you want,” Root said. \n”You can see a big progression in his game since he’s been involved in this tour. He’s right up for international cricket and he’s not someone who’s going to back down. \n“On this surface, he’s going to be a really good option. It looks like it’s going to give a bit of turn throughout.” \nTeam: Alastair Cook, Mark Stoneman, James Vince, Joe Root (captain), Dawid Malan, Jonny Bairstow, Moeen Ali, Tom Curran, Stuart Broad, Mason Crane, James Anderson (Reporting by Nick Mulvenney, Editing by Greg Stutchbury)", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-03T04:33:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-03T04:56:44.009+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
