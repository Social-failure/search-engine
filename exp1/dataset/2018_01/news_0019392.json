This was just a great confidence booster.”\nOsmond, meanwhile, fell on her first jump but displayed poise to skate cleanly thereafter.\n“It was a random mistake,” said the 22-year-old from Toronto, who is expected to be a major contender at next month’s Winter Olympics in South Korea.\n”Obviously, I‘m not overly pleased with it. I don’t remember the last time that I missed a (triple) flip in competition.\n“But overall I‘m so happy that I was able to come back after a fall, a very uncharacteristic fall for me, and be able to keep my focus through the whole program.”\nAlso on Friday, Olympic silver medalist Patrick Chan took the lead in the men’s short program with a routine that earned him 90.98 points, ahead of Kevin Reynolds.\nChan did not quite display the form of his 2011-13 peak, when he won three consecutive world championships, but he looked sharp enough to suggest he will also be a factor in Pyeongchang.\nIn the pairs, Meagan Duhamel and Eric Radford opened a huge lead on 81.78 points, while in the ice dance, 2010 Olympic champions Tessa Virtue and Scott Moir were nearly perfect to lead with a stellar 85.12 points.\nThe Canadian team is widely expected to be one of the powerhouses in South Korea, with 17 spots allotted for the country’s skaters, more than any other nation.\nCanada will name its team on Sunday at the completion of the championships.\nReporting by Andrew Both in Cary, North Carolina; Editing by John O'Brien\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-13T06:25:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-13T06:42:02.070+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
