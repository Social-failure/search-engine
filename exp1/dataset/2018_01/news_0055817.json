The 10-year JGB futures price ticked up to 150.26 from around 150.20 following the announcement. \nIWATA‘S TERM COMING TO AN END \nUnder a yield curve control (YCC) policy, the BOJ guides short-term interest rates at minus 0.1 percent and the 10-year government bond yield around zero percent. \nKuroda has struggled to tame market speculation that the BOJ may follow in the footsteps of U.S. and European peers in heading for an exit from crisis-mode policy, fueled in part by Japan’s brightening recovery prospects. \nComplicating this task is a growing chorus of policymakers in the BOJ board looking at an exit from ultra-accommodative policy, the summary of debate at January’s rate review showed. \n“If the economy and prices continue to improve, the BOJ may need to consider adjusting its yield targets to make its policy framework more sustainable,” one board member said. \nEven Iwata, a vocal advocate of aggressive easing, said BOJ efforts alone won’t be enough to hit 2 percent inflation and urged the government to remove barriers that hamper competition. \n“Government steps, as well as appropriate monetary policy, are necessary to achieve price stability with sustained economic growth,” said Iwata, whose five-year term ends in March. \nThese remarks run counter to Iwata’s earlier view that central banks are primarily responsible for accelerating inflation and can do so as long as they print money fast enough. \nIwata is seen as an architect of the BOJ’s huge asset-buying program, dubbed “quantitative and qualitative easing” (QQE) that aimed to shock the public out of a deflationary mindset. \nThe departure of Iwata, who said he was “quite sure” he wouldn’t be reappointed, would symbolize an end to the BOJ’s radical monetary experiment. \nIwata’s exit could also raise the odds of the BOJ dropping its loose pledge to buy bonds at a pace that increases its holdings by 80 trillion yen ($735 billion) a year, an assurance made obsolete by the pace already slowing to almost half that level. \n“In a country like Japan where inflation expectations aren’t anchored at the central bank’s target, it’s hard to fight big headwinds,” he said, blaming a sales tax hike in 2014 and slumping oil costs for delaying the achievement of 2 percent inflation. \nWhile YCC can reflate growth, it lacks the power to change public perceptions of future price moves, Iwata said, urging the government to keep fiscal policy accommodative and speed up structural reforms. \n“The BOJ doesn’t have the means to boost inflation expectations alone. That’s why all three arrows of ‘Abenomics’ must be reflationary,” he said in the final speech of his term.
