He said he believed I had the capabilities.” BREAKTHROUGH YEAR \nColeman had a breakthrough campaign in 2017, with the year’s fastest 100 metres, 9.82 seconds, at the U.S. collegiate championships before beating world record holder Usain Bolt for the 100 metres silver at London’s world championships. \nNow the 21-year-old has captured the indoor world record in his first meeting of 2018. \n“I just came into the season wanting to push myself to new heights,” said the former University of Tennessee sprinter who turned professional in June. \n“People turn professional and they are not running as fast as they did in college because it is a lot different, but I wanted to make sure that I didn’t have that kind of transition and always stayed on top.” \nNeither Coleman nor coach Tim Hall had expected what transpired on Friday. \nTraining had been going well, and a speedy 6.47 seconds, the top time in the world, in the preliminaries had set the two thinking maybe something special was possible in the final. \nMentally Coleman also knew he was stronger than last season. \n”Last year I wanted to be great so bad sometimes I would overwork. I would do workouts that weren’t part of the regime. \n“I realised this season I had to work smarter, not harder.” DIFFERENT FEELING \nStarting has also been a point of emphasis, and the Georgia native got out so fast on Friday, “it felt a little different,” he said. \n“It didn’t necessarily feel that great - I felt I could have got more out of it but when you are doing something different you obviously don’t always feel comfortable.” \nHe will next compete in the Boston Indoor Grand Prix on Feb. 10, then go for U.S. and world indoor titles, the latter scheduled for early March in Birmingham, England. \n“It (the world championships) is something I had my mind set on coming into the season because I think in big races is where I excel the most,” Coleman said. \nWhile many had thought Canada’s Andre De Grasse and South African world 400 metres record holder Wayde Van Niekerk would be the next great sprinters with Bolt’s retirement, Coleman had other ideas. \n“I knew potentially I could be the ‘next guy’,” he said. \nSuccess at the 2017 London worlds solidified that feeling. \n“If I can handle the type of pressure and that kind of competition, I am ready to take on the world,” he said.
