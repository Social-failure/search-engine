It’s going to take some time. I made mistakes where I shouldn’t have, and there are a lot of gaps I need to fill. There were both good and bad.”\nNishikori was ninth in the world rankings before suffering the injury ahead of the Cincinnati Masters last August.\nHe had been hoping to make his return at the season-opening Brisbane International, where he was runner-up in 2017, but withdrew from that event to continue his recovery.\nThe 28-year-old became the first Japanese man to reach a grand slam final at the 2014 U.S. Open but did not compete at Flushing Meadows last year because of his injury.\nCounting the positives, Nishikori said he did not feel any pain during his one hour, 47-minute match.\n“Just because I didn’t play well today, I‘m not going to get negative. I’ll keep working hard,” he said.\nReporting by Sudipto Ganguly in Mumbai; Editing by John O'Brien\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-24T06:38:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-24T08:12:52.007+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
