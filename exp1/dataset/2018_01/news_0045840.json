Questioning of the other 132 is continuing, it said.\n“Police officials said that social media accounts are being monitored ceaselessly and that all users who spread terror groups’ propaganda will be prosecuted,” Anadolu said.\nAnkara has enforced a crackdown since a failed coup in 2016 that critics say has unjustly targeted pro-Kurdish politicians. Some HDP lawmakers have been jailed on terrorism charges, which they deny.\nIn total, more than 50,000 people have been jailed and face trial since the attempted putsch and 150,000 have been sacked or suspended from their jobs. The government says the moves were necessary given the security threats Turkey faces.\nWriting by Daren Butler; Editing by David Dolan\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-01-24T17:02:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-25T13:08:16.028+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
