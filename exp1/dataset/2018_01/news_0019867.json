That advice runs counter to conventional asset allocation wisdom that long-term investors should have a portion of their portfolios in bonds.\nEven with stocks at around record highs, people who buy into the market now will do better in equities than bonds over time, Fink said. BlackRock is still \"quiet bullish\" on equities at these levels, he added.\nThose comments about stocks versus bonds echo what billionaire investor Warren Buffett told CNBC earlier this week.\nThe Berkshire Hathaway chairman and CEO reiterated what he's said for years: Don't buy bonds, stock are the way to go.\nDespite that advice, investors did indeed pour into bonds in the latest quarter, Fink said.\nHe believes that's happening because people are not good at market timing and therefore seek the safety of bonds.\nshow chapters BlackRock's Larry Fink: Surprised by huge inflows in bonds 9 Hours Ago | 02:37 Fink, BlackRock's chairman and CEO, also said the Republican tax overhaul law is largely going to help Americans , and should add about 1 percent annually to economic growth, at least in the first few years.\nMeanwhile, the U.S. corporate tax cut is a problem for Mexico because the rate is now lower in America, Fink said. Companies that had domiciled in Mexico for tax reasons are going to make their new tax homes in the U.S., he predicts.\nHe appeared Friday on \"Squawk Box\" shortly after BlackRock, the largest asset manager in the world, reported better-than-expected quarterly earnings and revenue.\nTotal assets under management stand at nearly $6.3 trillion, slightly ahead of estimates.\nMorning Squawk: CNBC's before the bell news roundup Sign up to get Morning Squawk each weekday\nJob Industry Advertising/Marketing Automotive Communications/PR Construction/Manufacturing Education Finance/Banking/Insurance Legal Media/Entertainment Medical/Health Care Mining/Oil/Gas/Utilities Gov't/Non-Profit Real Estate Retail Technology/IT Transportation/Shipping Travel/Hospitality Other Get this delivered to your inbox, and more info about about our products and service.
