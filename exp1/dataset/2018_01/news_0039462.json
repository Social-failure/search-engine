Disney is hoping to buy the asset from Murdoch at a later date.\nReporting by Paul Sandle; editing by Kate Holton\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-01-23T15:16:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-24T15:55:05.021+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
