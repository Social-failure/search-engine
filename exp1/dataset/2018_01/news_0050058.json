REUTERS/Mike Blake/File Picture \nAfter previously trying to stay nonpartisan, he threw his support behind Trump in the 2016 campaign and donated money to several Republican causes including the RNC. \nHe was named finance chairman of the committee after Trump became president. \nThe board of directors of Wynn Resorts said on Friday it had met to form a special committee consisting solely of independent directors to investigate the allegations contained in the Journal’s article. \nThe special investigation panel will be chaired by Patricia Mulroy, a member of the board’s corporate governance and compliance committees and a former member of the Nevada Gaming Commission, the board said in a statement. \nThe Wall Street Journal said former and current company staff members it interviewed had accused Wynn of creating a hostile work environment for women and of regularly pressuring employees to perform sex acts. \n“The idea that I ever assaulted any woman is preposterous,” Wynn said in a statement on Friday. “The instigation of these accusations is the continued work of my ex-wife, Elaine Wynn, with whom I am involved in a terrible and nasty lawsuit in which she is seeking a revised divorce settlement.” \nA spokeswoman for Elaine Wynn, 75, declined comment on Friday, but her Washington-based attorney, James Cole, told Reuters the notion that his client fomented the allegations in the Journal article “is just not true.” Additonal reporting by Yeganeh Torbati, Dustin Volz and Ginger Gibson; Writing by Daniel Trotta; Editing by Bill Trott and Chris Reese", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-27T22:07:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-27T22:37:52.016+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
