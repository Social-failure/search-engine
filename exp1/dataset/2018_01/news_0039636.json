REUTERS/Alessandro Bianchi On Tuesday, after the nominations were announced, she told Army Radio that they had “saved us from bitter disappointment and a false presentation of the Israel Defense Forces internationally”, while adding that she had not seen the movie.\nHer previous criticism had prompted Israel’s Film and Television Academy to disinvite her from its annual prize ceremony in September, to which she responded with a threat to cut the academy’s government funding.\n“Foxtrot” also won the Silver Lion grand jury prize at the Venice Film Festival in September. After accepting the award, writer-director Samuel Maoz said: “If I criticise the place I live, I do it because I worry. I do it because I want to protect it. I do it from love.”\nWriting by Jeffrey Heller; Additional reporting by Dan Williams; Editing by Kevin Liffey\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-23T19:01:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-23T19:50:29.014+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
