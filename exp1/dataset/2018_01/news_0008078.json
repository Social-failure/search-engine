Economists warn that undoing the law would cost billions of euros and alarm financial markets.\nBut the law is highly unpopular with Italians and the Northern League, led by Matteo Salvini, has made its repeal its number one priority. “Cancelling the Fornero Law (is) in the center-right program. Mission accomplished,” Salvini wrote on Twitter on Sunday.\nHe also said that the three parties had agreed to expel all illegal migrants and “take control” of the country’s borders, which are currently covered by the EU free-travel Schengen zone.\nSunday’s statement made no reference to another League proposal - exiting the euro currency - but did commit the conservative bloc to introducing an unspecified flat tax.\nThe Northern League has called for a 15 percent flat tax, while Berlusconi has proposed a flat rate of between 20 and 25 percent. Income tax bands currently run from 23 to 43 percent.\nThe bloc has given no indication of how it intends to pay for its program, saying only that by lowering the tax rate, more people will pay up, raising the overall tax take.\nEconomy Minister Pier Carlo Padoan told Corriere della Sera newspaper on Sunday that the proposed flat tax was “not sustainable”.\nWith the election less than two months away, all Italian parties are looking to win votes with eye-catching ideas.\nThe ruling center-left Democratic Party suggested last week that it might abolish the television license fee, while the leftist Free and Equal party on Sunday proposed making university education free for all.\nReporting by Crispian Balmer, Editing by Rosalba O'Brien\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-08T00:55:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-08T01:56:55.010+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
