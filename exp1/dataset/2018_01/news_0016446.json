OLYMPIC DESTINY \nIf all goes to plan, Marino will lead a group of young snowboarders to their first Olympics, with teenage prospects Chloe Kim, Hailey Langland and Chris Corning all expected to make the team at the expense of more experienced riders. \nMarino long believed she was destined to one day compete at a Winter Games but had it not been for an incident on a family holiday when aged 13, she could have been on skis instead. \nGrowing up near New York, her family regularly embarked on winter holidays in Colorado where, despite an early flirtation with snowboarding, the young Marino was an avid skier. \nMarino admits that she was so passionate about improving that she pushed herself and her equipment to the limit, and during that fateful trip, her “girlyish” skis snapped while attempting an audacious jump. \nDespite his daughter’s pleas to rent another pair of skis, Marino’s father John stood his ground and unwittingly changed her choice of sport for good. \n“I asked if I could rent another pair of skis as it was the first day of vacation and I wanted to keep skiing but my dad was like ‘no, you have a perfectly good snowboard at home and you are going to use that the rest of time,'” Marino said. \n“I was really bummed about it but then as soon as I started getting into it and accepting the fact that I am going to have to snowboard the rest of the trip I really started to enjoy it.” \nThe rest, as they say, is history. Marino says she has only donned a pair of skis once more, something she will not be attempting again after falling flat on her face and promptly reverting straight back to her board. \nThat Colorado incident may have sparked a chain of events that finishes on a podium in South Korea but while Marino and her father are refusing to get too carried away, the U.S. team may well have found their star of the future.
