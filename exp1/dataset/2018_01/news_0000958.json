U.S. District Judge Richard Berman said he would tell the jury in response to the note that they should continue deliberating and try to reach a verdict.\nWednesday was the jury’s fourth day deliberating on the case, which has strained diplomatic relations between the United States and Turkey.\nAt the center of the three-week trial was testimony from Turkish-Iranian gold trader Reza Zarrab, who pleaded guilty to charges of violating sanctions and testified for U.S. prosecutors.\nZarrab testified that Atilla helped design fraudulent transactions of gold and food that allowed Iran to spend its oil and gas revenues abroad, including through U.S. financial institutions, defying U.S. sanctions.\nZarrab also implicated Turkish officials in the scheme, including President Tayyip Erdogan.\nAttempts to reach Erdogan’s spokesman for comment on the allegations at the trial have been unsuccessful. Erdogan has publicly dismissed the case as a politically motivated attack on his government.\nAtilla has denied all of the charges against him.\nHalkbank has denied taking part in any illegal transactions.\nU.S. prosecutors charged nine people in the criminal case, though only Zarrab, 34, and Atilla, 47, were arrested by U.S. authorities.\nReporting By Brendan Pierson; Editing by Alistair Bell\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-03T22:49:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-03T18:20:12.021+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
