And that will benefit the entire supply chain all the way down to semiconductors, to NAND memory [flash memory] producers,\" said Brandon Lin, SPQ Asia Capital's president and chief investment officer. \nThe Hong Kong-based hedge fund oversees $7 billion assets under management. \nSpeaking to CNBC on the sidelines of the Morgan Stanley China Technology, Media and Telecoms Conference in Beijing, Lin named Chinese e-commerce solutions provider Baozun and data center services provider 21Vianet as a few of his picks. \nSPQ Asia Capital also invests in Chinese real estate and is still optimistic about the sector despite talk of a property tax as its expected implementation in 2020 is still \"a bit far off,\" Lin said, adding that the sector is still \"trading at very attractive levels\" with price-to-equity ratio at 7 to 9 percent. \n\"China's fiscal system is very unique. It's hard to see how property tax is going to fill the entire gap of the the local government finances . I think land sales will continue to be a large, if not the major portion of the finances,\" he said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-08T08:03:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-08T08:04:18.005+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
