Prior to this, the vaccine was only approved for active immunization against influenza A subtype viruses and type B viruses, in persons 3 years of age and older.\n\"The flu vaccine is the one vaccine that people of almost all ages – from 6-month-old infants to older adults – should receive annually,\" said Patrick Desbiens, Senior Vice President, US Vaccines. \"The expanded indication for FLUARIX ® QUADRIVALENT in the US builds upon GSK's commitment to being a reliable supplier and partner to healthcare providers and their patients. We can now offer two flu vaccines that enable providers to use the same vaccine dose to help protect all recommended persons aged 6 months and older against this potentially serious illness.\"\nWith this approval, providers will be able to use the same dose of FLUARIX ® QUADRIVALENT (15 ug of hemagglutinin per virus strain in 0.5 mL) to cover all eligible persons from 6 months of age and up.\nThe supplemental Biologics License Application was based on a Phase III pivotal study of the efficacy of FLUARIX ® QUADRIVALENT in children 6 months through 35 months of age and on two supportive studies.\nAbout seasonal influenza\nSeasonal influenza (the \"flu\") is a contagious respiratory illness, caused by flu viruses. 1 There are two main types of flu viruses, A and B, that spread between people and can cause mild to severe illness. 2 Most flu activity in the US occurs from October through May, and it usually peaks between December and February. 3\nWhile anyone can get the flu, it can be particularly serious for young children, older people, pregnant women and people with certain health conditions, such as asthma. 4 According to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the best tool available to help protect yourself and those around you against the flu is to get vaccinated. The more people who are vaccinated, the less chance the virus has to spread. 5 Currently, the CDC recommends that all people over the age of 6 months get vaccinated against the flu annually. 6\nFor more information about flu, visit www.flu.gov and www.cdc.gov/flu .\nAbout FLUARIX ® QUADRIVALENT\nFLUARIX ® QUADRIVALENT was first approved in 2012 in the US for the prevention of influenza disease in people 3 years of age and older.
