A trial is expected to start in the coming weeks. \nFinnish Security Intelligence Service (Supo) also last year raised its threat level to “elevated” from “low”. \nIf the bill fails to reach the required majority, the constitutional changes would also need the approval of a new parliament following next year’s general election. \n“For too long, we have lagged behind other Western countries with our intelligence legislation, so there’s no need to drag this out,” defense minister Jussi Niinisto told a news conference. \n“From what I’ve heard from other parties, the laws are deemed necessary ... so we should enact them as soon as possible, before the country faces a serious security threat.” \nThe governing coalition controls 105 seats in parliament and needs the support of the 35 lawmakers in the opposition to reach the necessary 166 votes. \nThe bill aims to also boost powers for military intelligence and establish a new authority and a parliamentary committee to oversee intelligence operations. \nThe lawmakers are expected to vote on the bill in the spring after a review by a parliament committee overseeing constitutional law.
