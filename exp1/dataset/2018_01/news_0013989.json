The territory is a prime transit and consumption hub, with more than 90 percent of consumers from mainland China. \nEarlier on Wednesday Reuters reported that government records showed Lau Sai-yuan was a member of the Endangered Species Advisory Committee of Hong Kong’s Agriculture, Fisheries and Conservation Department (AFCD). \nLau announced he would step down from the committee, broadcaster RTHK said on Wednesday afternoon. His term was to have run until Sept. 30 this year. \nNeither the AFCD nor the government responded to requests for comment. \nLau, a member of the Chinese General Chamber of Commerce and the Hong Kong Art Craft Merchants Association, had pleaded guilty on Tuesday to illegal ivory possession and was fined HK$8,000 ($1,022). \nThe conviction came less than two weeks after China enforced a total ban on ivory sales.

Wildlife activists called the ban, adopted at the end of 2017, a vital step to reduce the slaughter of the endangered animals.

REUTERS/Bobby Yip/File Photo \nHong Kong, a special administrative region of China, has lagged far behind and only set a timetable for a ban on ivory trading last year, with a phase-out time of five years. \nThe former British colony adheres to the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES), which started in the 1970s to regulate international trade in ivory, before banning it from 1990. \nA Hong Kong government-led operation in June 2017 found Lau was one of two ivory traders who had sold ivory chopsticks with ivory obtained after the 1990 ban. \nOnly “pre-Convention ivory” is allowed to be traded, with the ivory accompanied by a pre-convention certificate. \nTrade in pre-convention ivory has thrived in China and Hong Kong since 1975. Environmental activists say it has led to an increase in laundering ivory and is a prime obstacle in stamping out poaching.
