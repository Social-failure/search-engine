Last year it broke news that Mali’s main jihadist groups had merged, and in 2013 it had exclusive reports about a militant attack on a gas plant in Algeria in which 38 hostages were killed.\nIn the statement Sahrawi also claimed a car bomb attack on French troops on Thursday near Mali’s city of Menaka, ANI reported. He said it had “killed many of them”, although the French military said in a statement that the attack had merely wounded three troops.\nLawlessness across the Sahara has enabled jihadist groups to thrive and launch increasingly deadly attacks on local and Western targets there and in the semi-arid Sahel south of it. They are seen as the biggest threat to the region’s stability.\nReporting by Kissima Diagana; Writing by Tim Cocks; Editing by Hugh Lawson\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-13T17:12:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-13T17:36:43.017+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
