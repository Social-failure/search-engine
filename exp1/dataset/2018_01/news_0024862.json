An Alitalia passenger aircraft takes off at Fiumicino International Airport in Rome, Italy January 15, 2018. REUTERS/Max Rossi \nAlitalia, which has made a profit only a few times in its 70-year history, was put under special administration last year after staff rejected a plan to cut jobs and salaries. \nGermanyâ€™s Lufthansa ( LHAG.DE ), British low-cost carrier easyJet ( EZJ.L ) and U.S. private equity fund Cerberus are among companies that have expressed an interest in Alitalia. \nRome originally planned to enter exclusive talks with one of the parties by mid-January in the hope to strike a deal before national elections due March 4. \nThe two ministers asked the commissioners managing Alitalia to work quickly on a sale once a solid and credible offer is made.
