(NYSE: AMC). The complaint is brought on behalf of all purchasers of AMC securities pursuant to the company's secondary public offering (the \"SPO\") on February 8, 2017 and between December 20, 2016 and August 1, 2017, for alleged violations of the Securities Act of 1933 and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 by AMC's officers and directors. AMC owns and operates the world's largest chain of movie theaters.\nView this information on the law firm's Shareholder Rights Blog: www.robbinsarroyo.com/amc-entertainment-holdings-inc\nAMC Accused of Misrepresentations in its Secondary Public Offering Prospectus\nAccording to the complaint, on December 21, 2016, AMC completed its acquisition of Carmike Cinemas, Inc., noting AMC's newly enhanced growth potential and that AMC had a solid understanding of Carmike's customer visitation trends. On February 9, 2017, AMC sold 20,330,874 common shares to the public for $31.50 per share, for a total of $618 million (the \"SPO\"). The complaint alleges that AMC inaccurately portrayed Carmike's revenue growth and operations and failed to disclose the material changes that were having an adverse effect on Carmike's business at the time of the SPO. On August 1, 2017, AMC announced disappointing preliminary financial results for Q2 2017, causing AMC's stock to plummet nearly 27%, closing at $15.20 per share on August 2, 2017. AMC's stock currently trades at $13.25, less than half the SPO price of $31.50 per share.\nAMC Shareholders Have Legal Options\nConcerned shareholders who would like more information about their rights and potential remedies can contact attorney Leonid Kandinov at (800) 350-6003, LKandinov@robbinsarroyo.com , or via the shareholder information form on the firm's website.\nRobbins Arroyo LLP is a nationally recognized leader in shareholder rights law.
