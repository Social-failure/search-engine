It’s just another milestone,” said Michael Antonelli, managing director, institutional sales trading at Robert W. Baird in Milwaukee. \n“The point that people need to take is that the macro indicators are telling investors that world economies are doing really well.” \nWorld stocks also hit records, driven by strong manufacturing and services sector data in major economies. \nU.S. private employers stepped up hiring in December and planned layoffs by American-based companies fell sharply, pointing to sustained labor market strength. \nThe ADP National Employment Report showed that U.S. private employers added 250,000 jobs in December, much above the 190,000 job additions forecast by economists polled by Reuters. \nInvestors’ focus now shifts to the more comprehensive non-farm payrolls report on Friday. \nAt 10:58 a.m. ET (1558 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 150.34 points, or 0.6 percent, at 25,073.02 and the S&P 500 was up 12.98 points, or 0.48 percent, at 2,726.04. The Nasdaq Composite was up 22.58 points, or 0.32 percent, at 7,088.11. \nEight of the 11 major S&P sectors were higher, led by 1.4 percent gain in the financial index. \nWells Fargo and JPMorgan rose about 2 percent and Goldman Sachs 1.7 percent after the strong data raised the odds of a March rate hike. \nVictoria’s Secret-owner L Brands slid 15 percent on disappointing quarterly earnings forecast. \nJ.C. Penney and Macy’s were down about 6 percent after reporting same-store sales for the key months of November and December. \nSprint fell about 5 percent after the wireless carrier appointed former Altice NV Chief Executive Michel Combes as chief financial officer. \nIntel declined as much as 5 percent, adding to Wednesday’s losses that was triggered by a report that its chips were vulnerable to being hacked. \nRival Advanced Micro Devices rose 6.5 percent. \nAdvancing issues outnumbered decliners on the NYSE by 1,692 to 1,065. On the Nasdaq, 1,635 issues rose and 1,185 fell.
