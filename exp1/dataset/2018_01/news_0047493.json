The result swamped forecasts by analysts polled by Thomson Reuters for the quarter, which ranged between $2.35 billion to $2.36 billion.\nGross margin for the fourth quarter rose to 40.6 percent, above the midpoint of its previous guidance, but it cautioned that margins would decrease to levels around 39.5 percent during the current first quarter - plus or minus 2 percent.\nSTMicro said it expected net revenue to decrease 10 percent during the first quarter of 2018 from the fourth quarter last year (+/-3.5 pct). However, the current quarter revenue is set to rise around 22 percent from the year-ago first quarter.\nReporting by Eric Auchard; Editing by Sudip Kar-Gupta\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-25T08:24:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-25T08:42:44.002+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
