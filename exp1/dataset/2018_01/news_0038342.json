But the BoE does not expect it to return to its 2 percent target before 2021. \nFurthermore, the IHS Markit survey showed households’ need for unsecured borrowing grew at the fastest pace in 11 months. \nOfficial data has shown consumer lending growth cooled in the second half of last year. \n“There was little evidence to suggest that households reined in day-to-day spending, as households increased their expenditure at a modest rate whilst utilising additional unsecured debt to balance budgets,” said Teague. \nForty-five percent of households expected the BoE to raise interest rates within six months, down slightly from 48 percent in December’s survey. \nA Reuters poll of economists published last week showed the BoE is likely to keep rates at 0.5 percent until the fourth quarter of this year, having increased borrowing costs for the first time in over a decade in November. [ECILT/GB] \nHouseholds reported a strong rise in workplace activity but job insecurity hit a six-month high, IHS Markit said. Official data have shown two consecutive monthly declines in employment, suggesting employers are turning more cautious as Brexit nears. \nThe IHS Markit survey, conducted by Ipsos MORI, polled 1,500 Britons between Jan. 10 and 14.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-22T03:07:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-22T03:38:40.037+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
