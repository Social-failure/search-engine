The index briefly stepped into positive territory in early trade.\nAlthough the Nikkei is still up 2 percent this year, it has fallen 3.8 percent from its recent 26-year peak of 24,129.34 hit a week ago.\nReal estate firms, mining companies and steelmakers were among Wednesday’s big losers. Mitsubishi Estate declined 1.2 percent, Sumitomo Realty & Development fell 1.6 percent, Inpex Corp dropped 1.2 percent and Nippon Steel & Sumitomo Metal shed 1.0 percent.\nBucking the weakness, NEC Corp soared more than 5 percent after it said that it was seeking to cut its domestic workforce by 3,000 people.\nThe broader Topix declined 0.1 percent to 1,855.48.\nEditing by Sam Holmes\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-31T04:22:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-31T04:33:09.029+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
