Airbnb \nA glass-paneled wall slides away to create an indoor/outdoor living room, allowing fresh air to breeze through the house. Airbnb \nThe open kitchen has the requisite stainless steel appliances, ample counter space and a breakfast nook that overlooks the lush backyard. Airbnb \nThe estate has five bedrooms, two of which are furnished with king-sized beds. Airbnb \nHis and hers vanities make the master feel more like a private spa than a bathroom. Airbnb \nIndoor amenities include a home office, craft room and billiards table. Airbnb \nBut the resort-like backyard is the highlight of the property. Guests can spend days lounging in the sun beside the pool and nights curled up next to the firepit. Airbnb \nAn outdoor kitchen makes it entertaining easy. Airbnb \nAt night the backyard twinkles, showing off the impeccable landscaping even after the sun has set. It sure won't feel like you're in Kansas anymore.
