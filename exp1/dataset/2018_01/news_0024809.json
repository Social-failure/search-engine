Security Council’s call for the rebels and the government to fortify future ceasefires and avoid a return to fighting.\nThe ELN, founded by radical Roman Catholic priests in 1964, has sought peace with the government before but made little progress. It is considered a terrorist group by the United States and European Union.\nReporting by Luis Jaime Acosta; Writing by Julia Symmes Cobb; Editing by Sandra Maler\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-15T02:42:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-15T02:55:01.001+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
