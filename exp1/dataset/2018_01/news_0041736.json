It will also boost its capital expenditures and other investments by 62 percent to 4.2 trillion won this year.\nSteel futures in China, the world’s biggest steel consumer, surged 47 percent in 2017, the second year in a row of annual gains, on rising demand for materials and tightening supplies as Beijing pushed to cut overcapacity and pollution.\nChina’s economy grew faster than expected in the fourth quarter of 2017, as an export recovery helped the country post its first annual acceleration in growth in seven years.\nPOSCO’s share price has risen 16 percent so far this year, outpacing the wider market’s 2.9 percent gain.
