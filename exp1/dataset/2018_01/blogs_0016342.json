The average American holds 3.1 cards , with an average balance of $6,354 across all cards.\nBut how many is too many credit cards — or too few? Is there a magic number?\nNo, \"there's not a one-size-fits-all answer,\" Greg McBride, chief financial analyst at Bankrate.com, tells CNBC Make It . \"It depends on what you're using credit for and if you're disciplined about paying the balance in full every month.\"\nHow many cards you can reasonably keep track of without accruing debt?

You'll want to keep your balance below $1,000 and no higher than $3,000.\nWhen you open a new card, the amount of overall credit available to you increases. If your spending habits stay the same, your credit utilization ratio automatically improves.\nCredit cards also offer a host of perks, such as airline miles, hotel points and cash back.
