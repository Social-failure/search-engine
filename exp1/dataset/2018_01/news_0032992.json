Slideshow (7 Images) \nOsaka shredded those hopes in 73 minutes on Rod Laver Arena, breaking Barty to open both sets and combining 12 aces, the last on match point, with 24 winners in a ruthless display of power tennis. \nThe 20-year-old Japanese, who is ranked 72nd and beat defending champion Angelique Kerber at the U.S. Open last year, will next face Romania’s world number one Simona Halep for a place in the quarter-finals.
