Lauda has not said so far how much he is paying for Niki. [nL8N1PI0KW] \nBild am Sonntag said he had already transferred around 12 million of the purchase price. \nA spokeswoman for Lauda declined to comment. \nThe paper also said that around half of what Lauda is paying will go toward paying back a government loan that Niki parent Air Berlin ( AB1.DE ) received when it collapsed in August. \nGermany’s Economy Ministry declined to comment on the report. \n($1 = 0.8052 euros) Reporting by Maria Sheahan.
