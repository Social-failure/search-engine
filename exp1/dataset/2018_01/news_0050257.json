It makes it very complicated to calculate,” a senior executive at Korean automaker Hyundai Motor told Reuters. \n“You’ve got to find a way to adapt or circumvent somehow.” \nAn executive at South Korean battery-to-chemicals conglomerate SK Group said the news was also bad news for producers of intermediary goods such as SK, which supplies big manufacturers with thousands of components that will now be caught up in the spat. \nPrivately owned Dongjin Techwin, which supplies LG Electronics Inc, is already bracing for contract losses, as LG moves to produce components in-house.

REUTERS/Steve Marcus \n“There’d be little point on trying to figure out how to export components from Korea to the United States, and then build a washing machine there,” Jung Hyun-mo, a senior executive at Dongjin, told Reuters. “There just isn’t the export-import supply chain in place for that.” CUT OFF AT THE KNEES \nThe decision by Trump in the “Section 201” safeguard case came after the U.S. International Trade Commission found last year imports were “a substantial cause of serious injury to domestic manufacturers” including Whirlpool Corp. \nThe tariffs exceeded the harshest recommendations from ITC members, with a 20 percent tariff set on the first 1.2 million imported large residential washers in the first year, and a 50 percent tariff on additional imports.

REUTERS/Thomas White/File Photo \nWashington also imposed a 50 percent tariff on imported key parts in excess of 50,000 units in the first year, a move Samsung’s South Carolina plant manager fears could “cut us off at the knees”. \n“Although we are installing production equipment and we are committed to producing the major parts in-house, there will be a transition period during which importing parts will be necessary to successfully launch this facility,” Tony Fraley, Samsung’s plant manager, told the commission in October. \nWhen asked if there were any plan for price hikes to counter the tariffs, Samsung said it would discuss any changes with its business partners. \nConsultancy firm Euromonitor estimates South Korean washing machine makers would need to raise prices by $50 to $400 to cushion the impact of tariffs. \nLG was set to start production at its new plant in the third quarter at the earliest and is now working to accelerate its launch with officials in Clarksville, Tennessee who are eager for the jobs the new factory will bring. \n“We had several scenarios... this safeguard measure turned out to be the worst case one,” Kim Gun-tai, head of LG’s home appliance division told a conference call last week. \nLG, which announced a plan to raise prices on its washing machines sold in the United States last week, said in a separate statement to Reuters it was absorbing a significant portion of the tariff on parts. Once its U.S. plant’s operation began it would produce key parts on site, it added. \nThe safeguard issue is set to top the agenda when government officials from the two countries meet later this week to discuss trade issues. \nSouth Korea has already filed challenges and demands for compensation at the World Trade Organisation under the Safeguard Agreement.
