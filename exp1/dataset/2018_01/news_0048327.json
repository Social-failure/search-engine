The U.S. Trade Representative will announce the rules for requesting an exclusion by Feb. 22. The tariffs will take effect Feb. 7.\n“We have to stop the $20 million investment because the tariffs start before we know if we’re excluded,” Werner said. “It’s not hypothetical. These were positions that we were recruiting for that we are going to stop.”\nThat investment would create “hundreds” of jobs at SunPower facilities in California and Texas, Werner said. They would include jobs in research and development, manufacturing and sales and would be focused on the company’s next-generation cell technology.\nSunPower’s project development arm has already lost business to rival First Solar Inc ( FSLR.O ), which makes panels that are exempt from tariffs.\nSunPower is majority owned by France’s Total SA ( TOTF.PA ).\nReporting by Nichola Groom; Editing by Leslie Adler\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-26T01:58:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-26T02:14:46.008+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
