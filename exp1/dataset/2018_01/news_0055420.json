Transparency International, an anti-corruption group, says it has identified 4.4 billion pounds worth of property in Britain that should be considered as possible candidates for UWOs. \nIt highlighted five properties - four in London and one in the city’s commuter belt in Guildford, Surrey - that it said authorities should consider as sources of potentially illicit wealth. \nRachel Davies Teka, head of Advocacy Transparency International UK, said the introduction of UWO’s would help combat the fight against “dirty money” flowing into Britain. \n“They will allow law enforcement to much more easily investigate assets that are highly likely to have been bought using corrupt money, often stolen from populations in some of the poorest parts of the world,” she said. \nGreen called UWOs an “extremely useful tool” but cautioned that the SFO would not use them until it had the right case.
