Then, it should be peace, right now, right? But that’s not the case,” Fihn told a news conference in Tokyo.\n“Instead, we have increased risk. So I think we see clearly evidence that nuclear weapons fuel crisis.”\nICAN is a coalition of non-governmental groups that campaigned for a U.N. Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons, which was adopted by 122 nations last July.\nJapan, the only country to suffer nuclear bombings, did not take part in U.N. negotiations on the treaty, saying such talks without nuclear armed countries participating would not contribute to bringing about a world without nuclear weapons. Tokyo has not signed the treaty either.\n“We need action and leadership from Japan...Japan can be moral authority on nuclear disarmament, and that can begin with Prime Minister (Shinzo) Abe joining the treaty to prohibit nuclear weapons,” she said.\nReporting by Kiyoshi Takenaka; Editing by Angus MacSwan\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-16T18:41:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-16T18:45:37.030+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
