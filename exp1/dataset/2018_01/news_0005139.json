A blizzard of data in coming weeks is expected to show China’s economy ended a strong 2017 on a slightly softer note, but activity has likely remained more resilient than expected. Sources told Reuters China will keep its target for economic growth at “around 6.5 percent” in 2018, unchanged from last year.\nAnalysts also attributed the yuan’s strength to tighter liquidity conditions in China’s financial system, which has kept interest rates elevated.\nChina’s benchmark 10-year government bond yield CNY10YT=RR hovered near 4 percent, the highest in three years, compared with 2.45 percent for 10-year U.S. Treasuries US10YT=TWEB, as Beijing’s deleveraging campaign helped widen the spread.\nThe yuan’s recent performance is “perhaps reflective of the tight liquidity conditions onshore as well as optimism offshore about portfolio inflows,” National Australia Bank wrote in a note.\n“Barring a strong recovery in the USD in pace and extent in coming weeks, capital flows may still be constructive for CNY and CNH and may push USD/CNY towards 6.45 immediate key support.”\nMeanwhile, the U.S. currency’s lack of traction was highlighted overnight as the dollar failed to draw support from the stronger-than-expected jobs report.\nReporting by Samuel Shen and John Ruwitch; Editing by Jacqueline Wong\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-01-05T18:23:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-05T22:31:06.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
