FLAWLESS \nIt has been quite a return to form for Kerber in Australia this year after she broke a 27-tournament title drought going back to her 2016 U.S. Open triumph in the Sydney International warm-up and she has been flawless in the new year. \nKerber, who turned 30 last week, enjoyed a bumper 2016, winning the Australian and U.S. Opens, picking up an Olympic silver medal and becoming the first German number one since Steffi Graf. \nBut her form deserted her last year when she failed to win back-to-back matches at 13 events and made just one final, at Monterrey, to finish the year at number 22. \n”I mean, it feels the same,“ said Kerber, who is now guaranteed a return to top 10 in rankings. ”I‘m the same person like I was also last year. \n“The years before, here, nothing (has) changed. I think the only thing has changed is that I learned a lot, a lot of experience from last year. From the years before, as well. Not only from 2016. Also 2014 and 2015.” \nWozniacki was top seed and world number one on her previous visit to the last four at Melbourne Park seven years ago when she blew a match   and went on to lose to China’s Li Na. \nOn the flip side, the Dane saved two match points and battled back from 5-1 down in the deciding set to beat   this year. \nWozniacki has displayed a new brand of ruthless tennis when she battled to a maiden WTA Finals title last October in Singapore. \nHer semi-final opponent Mertens has also had a stellar year and the 22-year-old, who became   2012, thrashed   6-4 6-0 in the quarter-finals to show she is no pushover.
