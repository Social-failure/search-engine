The benchmark rose 0.7 percent on Friday. \nFinancials accounted for nearly half the gains on the index, with Commonwealth Bank of Australia rising 0.7 percent to a near five-month peak. \nOther banks in the “Big Four” notched gains of between 0.4 percent and 0.8 percent. \nHealthcare stocks were also sought out in early trade, with CSL Ltd and Cochlear Ltd climbing 0.9 percent and 2.4 percent, respectively. \nReal estate investment trust DEXUS Property Group was among the top gainers on the index, up 1.8 percent to a near three-week high. \n“People are willing to buy today, but I think there’s some caution creeping in because the market has had a strong run”, said Christopher Conway, head of research and trading at Australian Stock Report. \nConway suspects the Wall Street-backed rally, which is common during late-December to early-January, will slow down as more people return from their holiday breaks. \nInsurer Suncorp Group limited the market’s upside, slipping 1.4 percent to an over two-month low after it flagged a A$160 million - A$170 million ($125.73 million - $133.59 million) hit to its half-year earnings due to a hailstorm that pelted Melbourne in December. \nCommodity prices lost steam after a recent strong rally and pressured miners. Australia said it expects iron ore prices to average $51.50 a tonne this year, down 20 percent from 2017, because of rising global supply and moderating demand from top importer China as its steel sector shrinks. \nGold miner Newcrest Mining dropped 1.2 percent, while mining heavyweights BHP Billiton and Rio Tinto shed 0.4 percent each. \nNew Zealand’s benchmark S&P/NZX 50 index, which nudged higher to a record early on, eased 0.1 percent in thin trade. \nFisher & Paykel Healthcare Corporation Ltd and construction company Fletcher Building Ltd were the biggest drags on the index, dropping 1.2 percent each.
