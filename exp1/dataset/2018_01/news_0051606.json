Its market value has fallen to just US$268m from the US$6bn it commanded in February 2015.\nReliance Industries’ US$800m 3.667% 2027, which at the time of issue last November was called the tightest 10-year US dollar bond from India’s corporate sector, dropped to its lowest cash price.\nThe bonds were trading nearly half a point down to 97.03/97.42, according to Thomson Reuters data.\nMongolia’s US$500m 10.875% 2021s were two-tenths of a point lower at 118/118.625, while Chandra Asri Petrochemical’s 4.95% 2024s were a third of a point lower at 97.27/97.827, according to Thomson Reuters data.\nChina Cinda Asset Management’s 5.625% 2024s were under pressure, down a third of a point, after the bad-debt manager announced a mandate for a US dollar offering this morning. The rest of the curve was relatively stable amid two-way flows.\nThe Asia ex-Japan investment-grade CDS index was 2bp tighter at 62bp/62.75bp, driven by narrowing credit protection costs from Kookmin Bank and Hutchison Whampoa.\nReporting by Frances Yoon; Editing by Vincent Baby\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-01-29T17:23:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-30T18:44:23.020+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
