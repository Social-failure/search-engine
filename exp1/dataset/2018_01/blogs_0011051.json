They also were one of eight winners of Shopify's Build a BIGGER Business competition , which highlights some of the fastest growing businesses selling on Shopify.

Lavery and Brouwer, along with the other winners, spent five days at Robbin's Fiji resort for personal and group mentoring. \nTheir main takeaway from Robbins? Think long-term and think bigger. \n\"Without question, our biggest takeaway was the importance of staying focused on the long-term vision rather than the day-to-day â€” to stop you getting left behind,\" the co-founders tell CNBC Make It . \n\"Tony talked about big, successful businesses that seemed untouchable. But they got caught playing catch-up because they hadn't given enough thought to the future. They didn't anticipate the changing market, which created space for a competitor to knock them off the top spot.\" Courtesy of BestSelf Co Tony Robbins mentors Cathryn Lavery and Allen Brouwer \nRobbins encouraged them to answer three questions: What business are you in now? In the long term, what business do you need to be in? What are the steps you need to take to close the gap? \nFor Lavery and Brouwer, who sell paper journals, the experience encouraged them to think about how to diversify their products in order to offer something for those who prefer digital products. They started by launching a free Chrome extension that blocks distracting websites and helps you get more done.

That's how you survive long-term.\" ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-10T17:07:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-10T17:27:29.016+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
