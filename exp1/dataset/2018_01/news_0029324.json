The IPO is expected to price after the market close on Thursday. PRICE SENSITIVE \nThe IPO would allow Apollo to sell its investment in the company through future sales of ADT shares. \nBankers have been expecting IPO investors to be price-sensitive in 2018, with the US stock market trading at record highs and lifting the price of comparable companies against which IPOs are valued. \nIn the case of ADT, it is understood some investors took issue with the company’s calculation of adjusted Ebitda, particularly the treatment of capital expenditure. \nBased on midpoint pricing and ADT’s 2017 adjusted Ebitda of US$2.32bn-$2.37bn, ADT was seeking a valuation of a little under 10 times enterprise value-to-Ebitda. \nDuring the roadshow for the IPO, ADT management described the company as “recession-proof” with high margins and low working capital and maintenance capital requirements. \nIts main use of capex is for the installation of security systems for new customers. \nA key focus of the roadshow was the reduction in customer attrition since Apollo took control, with every 100 basis point improvement adding US$100m to cashflow. \n“Apollo just bought this business a year-and-a-half ago and they are trying to change so much, so quickly,” said one hedge-fund investor. “It’s tricky.” \nADT is the US’s largest provider of home security monitoring but is facing growing competition from monitoring apps that work directly on smartphones and other personal devices. \nEven at the lower valuation, the IPO is likely to be one of the largest in the first part of 2018. ADT is scheduled to begin trading on the New York Stock Exchange on Friday.
