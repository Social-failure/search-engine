The body of a mariner suspected to be from the ship was recovered on Monday and sent to Shanghai for identification. The rest of the crew, which included 30 Iranians and two Bangladeshis, remains missing.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-12T10:56:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-12T11:45:26.070+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
