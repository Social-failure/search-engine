He likened the project to geological surveys for deposits of materials from copper to silver. \nEach European, the report says, would own 250 kg (550 lb) of electronics - 3.5 times the average adult weight - along with 17 kg of batteries and almost 600 kg of vehicles if all equipment now in use were shared out.
