We will not comment further on these discussions.”\nThe Irish budget airline in December said it would recognise pilot unions for the first time in its 32-year history.\nRyanair said it would speak with Anpac, but not others who represent a smaller number of pilots, as well as cabin and ground crews.\nRyanair pilots in several countries mobilised after the company in September announced the cancellation of around 20,000 flights, which it blamed on a lack of standby pilots.\nIt blamed the rostering problem following a rule change by Irish regulators.\nPilot groups instead have complained of a toxic work atmosphere and said Ryanair is facing a major staffing shortage. Management has repeatedly denied this and says it offers some of the best pay and conditions in the sector.
