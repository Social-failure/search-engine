That essentially crushes Schrems‚Äôs hope of making pan-EU class actions a thing. \nIn a statement, Facebook concentrated on that side of the ruling. \n‚ÄúToday‚Äôs decision by the European Court of Justice supports the previous decisions of two courts that Mr. Schrems‚Äôs claims cannot proceed in Austrian courts as ‚Äòclass action‚Äô on behalf of other consumers,‚Äù a spokesperson said, adding that Facebook now looks forward to ‚Äúresolving this matter.‚Äù First quick video statement on the #CJEU judgment on the Facebook lawsuit.. üòâ pic.twitter.com/IxnFylBhlt \n‚Äî Max Schrems (@maxschrems) January 25, 2018 \nSchrems, meanwhile, said in a video reaction that he and his legal team would now be able to debate Facebook‚Äôs privacy policies with the company, including its transfer of personal data to the NSA, and its tracking of people‚Äôs online activities. \nRegarding the other side of the judgement, Schrems said the rejection of class-actions suits as a concept was not problematic for him, as he would now just bring a ‚Äúmodel case‚Äù against Facebook, but it was an issue for other cases involving mass corporate wrongdoings. \nSchrems also has another case against Facebook, over similar issues, pending before the CJEU‚Äîthough that one went via the Irish route . If he prevails in that case, Facebook may no longer be allowed to import anyone‚Äôs personal data from the EU to the U.S. SPONSORED FINANCIAL CONTENT ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-25T07:32:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-25T16:45:41.015+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
