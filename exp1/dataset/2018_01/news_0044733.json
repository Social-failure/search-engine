Two of the sources were briefed on the meeting by colleagues who were present.\nOne of the three sources said that, unusually for such gatherings, bankers were not just invited from the top 15 Russian banks, but from a wider circle of lenders.\nThe sources did not specify what was discussed at the meeting, but they said one of the topics of the meeting was potential new sanctions. Reuters was not able to establish on whose initiative the meeting was called.\nadditional reporting by Oksana Kobzeva; writing by Katya Golubkova; editing by Christian Lowe\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-01-25T23:46:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-26T21:11:33.007+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
