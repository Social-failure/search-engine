It is the world's largest confectionery company, with 12.8 percent of the global market, ahead of Mondelez which has 12.4 percent, according to research company Euromonitor. It works with the Ehrenberg-Bass Institute for Marketing Science to understand what makes people buy its products and where it should invest media money.\n\"This is very much working out what really drives brand behavior (and) buying behavior, really putting science and data behind that. So we can combine the best of our creative with the best of research and science to have our 'laws of growth,' our growth philosophy, to work out where we invest our dollars,\" Clarke told CNBC.\nDigital transformation is a focus for Mars, which hired Sandeep Dadlani as chief digital officer and George Corbin as chief digital demand officer in June 2017. Corbin reports to Clarke to help to convert people online into buyers.\n\"That's the great thing about marketing. It impacts the whole enterprise, (it's) not just about our marketing function. What we do as marketers really is about the growth strategy for the whole of our businesses â€¦ And therefore what we do in digital has an implication across the whole business as well,\" Clarke said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-15T12:59:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-15T12:59:48.001+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
