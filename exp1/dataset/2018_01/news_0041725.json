(NYSE: LVS), the world's leading developer and operator of convention-based Integrated Resorts, today reported financial results for the quarter ended December 31, 2017.\nFourth Quarter Overview\nMr. Sheldon G. Adelson, chairman and chief executive officer, said, \"We are extremely pleased to have delivered another set of strong financial results this quarter. Consolidated adjusted property EBITDA reached $1.34 billion, an increase of 19.7% compared to the fourth quarter of 2016. We also continued to return excess capital to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases during the quarter.\n\"The Macao market continued its robust recovery during the quarter, with growth in the important Mass gaming market accelerating in the fourth quarter of 2017. Sands China's Mass table games win increased 26.9%, outpacing the estimated growth in the market overall and contributing to our highest Mass gaming win since the first quarter of 2014. That strong gaming performance, coupled with higher hotel occupancy and retail mall revenues, helped drive an increase in adjusted property EBITDA of 19.8%, to $731 million, our best quarterly result in Macao since the third quarter of 2014. We are extremely pleased with our operating momentum in Macao and remain confident that our Cotai Strip property portfolio will continue to deliver important benefits to Macao in the form of economic diversification, greater numbers of business and leisure travelers, and a superior platform for growth in the years ahead.\n\"Marina Bay Sands again delivered outstanding financial results during the quarter with adjusted property EBITDA expanding 24.6% to reach $456 million. Marina Bay Sands' innovative programming, mass gaming play and non-gaming revenues underpin the continued success of this industry-leading property, while continued cost discipline also contributed to the strong performance. EBITDA margin increased 470 basis points in the quarter, reaching 55.3%. We are pleased to have established Marina Bay Sands as a reference site for other cities and countries that are considering harnessing the economic power and direct contributions to tourism, employment and GDP growth that are gained through our unique convention-based Integrated Resort business model.\"\nThe company paid a recurring quarterly dividend of $0.73 per common share during the quarter. The company announced that its next quarterly dividend of $0.75 per common share will be paid on March 30, 2018, to Las Vegas Sands shareholders of record on March 22, 2018. In addition, the company repurchased $75 million of common stock (1.1 million shares at a weighted average price of $68.99) during the quarter ended December 31, 2017.\nCompany-Wide Operating Results\nNet revenue for the fourth quarter of 2017 increased 11.7% to $3.44 billion, compared to $3.08 billion in the fourth quarter of 2016. Net income increased 124.1% to $1.36 billion in the fourth quarter of 2017, compared to $607 million in the year-ago quarter.\nOn a GAAP (accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America) basis, operating income in the fourth quarter of 2017 increased 53.5% to $1.03 billion, compared to $669 million in the fourth quarter of 2016. The increase in operating income was primarily due to stronger results in Macao and at Marina Bay Sands in Singapore and the impact of a change in our depreciable lives during the third quarter of 2017, as discussed further below. Consolidated adjusted property EBITDA (a non-GAAP measure) of $1.34 billion increased 19.7% in the fourth quarter of 2017, compared to the year-ago quarter. On a hold-normalized basis, adjusted property EBITDA was $1.29 billion in the fourth quarter of 2017, an increase of 18.9% from the prior-year quarter.\nOn a GAAP basis, net income attributable to Las Vegas Sands in the fourth quarter of 2017 increased 137.9% to $1.21 billion, compared to $509 million in the fourth quarter of 2016, while diluted earnings per share in the fourth quarter of 2017 of $1.53 represented an increase of 139.1% compared to the prior-year quarter. The increase in net income attributable to Las Vegas Sands reflected the increase in operating income described above and a nonrecurring non-cash income tax benefit of $526 million due to U.S. tax reform enacted at the end of 2017, partially offset by increases in other expense and net income attributable to noncontrolling interests.\nAdjusted net income attributable to Las Vegas Sands (a non-GAAP measure) increased 42.6% to $700 million, or $0.88 per diluted share, compared to $491 million, or $0.62 per diluted share, in the fourth quarter of 2016.\nOn a GAAP basis, full year 2017 operating income increased 38.9% to $3.46 billion, compared to $2.49 billion in 2016. The increase in operating income was principally due to higher net revenues, nonrecurring legal costs in 2016 and lower pre-opening expenses related to the opening of The Parisian Macao in 2016. Net income attributable to Las Vegas Sands increased 68.0% to $2.81 billion, or $3.54 per diluted share, in 2017, compared to $1.67 billion, or $2.10 per diluted share, in 2016. The increase in net income attributable to Las Vegas Sands reflected the increase in operating income and nonrecurring non-cash income tax benefit described above, partially offset by increases in interest expense, other expense and net income attributable to noncontrolling interests.\nSands China Ltd. Consolidated Financial Results\nOn a GAAP basis, total net revenues for Sands China Ltd. (SCL) increased 12.9% to $2.10 billion in the fourth quarter of 2017, compared to $1.86 billion in the fourth quarter of 2016.

This decrease was driven primarily by a change in the estimated useful lives of our buildings, building improvements and land improvements from a range of 15 to 40 years to 10 to 50 years from the date placed in service, as well as changes to the estimated useful lives of certain other furniture, fixtures and equipment, to better reflect the estimated periods during which these assets are expected to remain in service. The change in estimated useful lives was accounted for as a change in accounting estimate beginning on July 1, 2017, and resulted in a reduction of depreciation and amortization expense and an increase in operating income of $61 million, and an increase of net income attributable to Las Vegas Sands of $40 million, or earnings per share of $0.05 on a basic and diluted basis, in the fourth quarter of 2017.\nInterest expense, net of amounts capitalized, was $87 million for the fourth quarter of 2017, compared to $76 million in the prior-year quarter. Capitalized interest was $1 million during the fourth quarter of 2017 and 2016. Our weighted average borrowing cost in the fourth quarter of 2017 was approximately 3.4%, compared to 3.0% during the fourth quarter of 2016.\nOther expense, which was comprised primarily of foreign currency losses due to a depreciation of the U.S. dollar versus the Singapore dollar during the period, was $14 million for the fourth quarter of 2017, compared to other income of $64 million in the fourth quarter of 2016.\nOur effective income tax rate for the fourth quarter of 2017 was (46.1)% compared to 7.9% in the prior-year quarter. The tax rate for the fourth quarter of 2017 is primarily driven by a nonrecurring non-cash benefit of $526 million due to the changes in U.S. tax law enacted in December 2017 and is based on our initial analysis of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the \"Act\" or \"tax reform\") and may be adjusted in future periods as required. The Act creates complexity that will likely require implementation guidance from the Internal Revenue Service and could impact our tax return filing positions, which may impact the estimates and assumptions utilized in our initial analysis. This benefit is partially offset by a provision for the earnings from Marina Bay Sands at the 17% Singapore income tax rate. Our effective income tax rate for the fourth quarter of 2017 would have been 10.4% without the discrete benefit associated with changes in U.S. tax law.\nThe net income attributable to noncontrolling interests during the fourth quarter of 2017 of $149 million was principally related to SCL.\nBalance Sheet Items\nUnrestricted cash balances as of December 31, 2017 were $2.42 billion.\nAs of December 31, 2017, total debt outstanding, including the current portion and net of deferred financing costs (excluding those costs related to our revolving facilities) and original issue discount, was $9.64 billion.\nCapital Expenditures\nCapital expenditures during the fourth quarter totaled $245 million, including construction, development and maintenance activities of $131 million in Macao, $59 million at Marina Bay Sands, $41 million in Las Vegas and $14 million at Sands Bethlehem.\nConference Call Information\nThe company will host a conference call to discuss the company's results on Wednesday, January 24, 2018 at 1:30 p.m. Pacific Time.

Set forth in the financial schedules accompanying this release are reconciliations of the non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures. The non-GAAP financial measure disclosure by the company has limitations and should not be considered a substitute for, or superior to, the financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. The definitions of our non-GAAP financial measures and the specific reasons why the company's management believes that the presentation of the non-GAAP financial measures provides useful information to investors regarding the company's financial condition, results of operations and cash flows are presented below.\nThe following non-GAAP financial measures are used by management, as well as industry analysts, to evaluate the company's operations and operating performance. These non-GAAP financial measures are presented so that investors have the same financial data that management uses in evaluating financial performance with the belief that it will assist the investment community in properly assessing the underlying financial performance of the company on a year-over-year and a quarter sequential basis.\nAdjusted net income, which is a non-GAAP financial measure, excludes certain non-recurring corporate expenses, pre-opening expense, development expense, gain or loss on disposal of assets, loss on modification or early retirement of debt and other income or expense, attributable to Las Vegas Sands, net of income tax and an adjustment for a nonrecurring non-cash benefit due to U.S. tax reform enacted in 2017. Adjusted net income and adjusted earnings per diluted share are presented as supplemental disclosures as management believes they are (1) each widely used measures of performance by industry analysts and investors and (2) a principal basis for valuation of Integrated Resort companies, as these non-GAAP measures are considered by many as alternative measures on which to base expectations for future results. These measures also form the basis of certain internal management performance expectations.\nConsolidated adjusted property EBITDA, which is a non-GAAP financial measure, is net income before stock-based compensation expense, corporate expense, pre-opening expense, development expense, depreciation and amortization, amortization of leasehold interests in land, gain or loss on disposal of assets, interest, other income or expense, gain or loss on modification or early retirement of debt and income taxes. Management utilizes consolidated adjusted property EBITDA to compare the operating profitability of its operations with those of its competitors, as well as a basis for determining certain incentive compensation. Integrated Resort companies have historically reported adjusted property EBITDA as a supplemental performance measure to GAAP financial measures. In order to view the operations of their casinos on a more stand-alone basis, Integrated Resort companies, including Las Vegas Sands, have historically excluded certain expenses that do not relate to the management of specific properties, such as pre-opening expense, development expense and corporate expense, from their adjusted property EBITDA calculations. Consolidated adjusted property EBITDA should not be interpreted as an alternative to income from operations (as an indicator of operating performance) or to cash flows from operations (as a measure of liquidity), in each case, as determined in accordance with GAAP. The company has significant uses of cash flow, including capital expenditures, dividend payments, interest payments, debt principal payments and income tax payments, which are not reflected in consolidated adjusted property EBITDA. Not all companies calculate adjusted property EBITDA in the same manner. As a result, consolidated adjusted property EBITDA as presented by Las Vegas Sands may not be directly comparable to similarly titled measures presented by other companies.\nHold-normalized adjusted property EBITDA, a supplemental non-GAAP financial measure, that, in addition to the aforementioned reasons for the presentation of consolidated adjusted property EBITDA, is presented to adjust for the impact of certain variances in table games' win percentages, which can vary from period to period. Hold-normalized adjusted property EBITDA is based on applying a Rolling Chip win percentage of 3.15% to the Rolling Chip volume for the quarter if the actual win percentage is outside the expected range of 3.0% to 3.3% for our Macao properties, applying a Rolling Chip win percentage of 2.85% to the Rolling Chip volume for the quarter if the actual win percentage is outside the expected range of 2.7% to 3.0% for our Singapore property, and applying a win percentage of 22.0% for Baccarat and 20.0% for non-Baccarat games to the respective table games drops for the quarter if the actual win percentages are outside the expected ranges of 18.0% to 26.0% for Baccarat and 16.0% to 24.0% for non-Baccarat at our Las Vegas properties. No hold adjustments are made for Sands Bethlehem. We do not present adjustments for Non-Rolling Chip drop for our table games play at our Macao and Singapore properties, nor for slots at any of our properties. Hold-normalized adjusted property EBITDA is also adjusted for the estimated gaming taxes, commissions paid to third parties on the incremental win, bad debt expense, discounts and other incentives that would have been incurred when applying the win percentages noted above to the respective gaming volumes. The hold-normalized adjusted property EBITDA measure presents a consistent measure for evaluating the operating performance of our properties from period to period.\nHold-normalized adjusted net income and hold-normalized adjusted earnings per diluted share are additional supplemental non-GAAP financial measures that, in addition to the aforementioned reasons for the presentation of adjusted net income and adjusted earnings per diluted share, are presented to adjust for the impact of certain variances in table games' win percentages, which can vary from period to period.\nThe company may also present the above items on a constant currency basis. This information is a non-GAAP financial measure that is calculated by translating current quarter local currency amounts to U.S. dollars based on prior period exchange rates. These amounts are compared to the prior period to derive non-GAAP constant-currency growth/decline. Management considers non-GAAP constant-currency growth/decline to be a useful metric to investors and management as it allows a more direct comparison of current performance to historical performance.\nThe company also makes reference to adjusted property EBITDA margin and hold-normalized adjusted property EBITDA margin, which are calculated using the aforementioned non-GAAP financial measures.\nExhibit 1\nLas Vegas Sands Corp. and Subsidiaries\nCondensed Consolidated Statements of Operations\n(In millions, except per share data)\n(Unaudited)\nThree Months Ended\nYear
