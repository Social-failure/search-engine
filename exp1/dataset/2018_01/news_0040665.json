DeMar DeRozan scored 14 points, Serge Ibaka had 12 and OG Anunoby added 10 to lead the way for Toronto. The Raptors shot 43.8 percent (39 of 89) from the field overall and 38.9 percent (14 of 36) from 3-point range.\nDennis Schroder had 20 points and eight rebounds, and Kent Bazemore and John Collins each scored 13 points in defeat for the Hawks. Atlanta shot just 39.4 percent (37 of 94) from the floor, including 33.3 percent (7 of 21) from 3-point range.\nThe Raptors were in control from the start, taking a 28-16 lead after one quarter, leading by as many as 21 points in the second quarter and 58-40 at halftime.\nThe game didn’t get much closer in the third quarter, with Toronto going up by as many 24 points at 83-59 with 2:42 remaining in the period.\nIn the fourth quarter, Toronto led by as many as 32 points.\nRebounding from a loss at Minnesota on Saturday, Toronto will next host the Utah Jazz on Friday.\nThe Hawks were coming off a win over Utah on Monday, but they couldn’t build on that win and will try and get on track against the Hornets in Charlotte on Friday.\n--Field Level Media\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-01-25T11:16:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-25T13:14:48.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
