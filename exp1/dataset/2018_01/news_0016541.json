It’s sort of systemic I think,” Redmayne said. \nRedmayne and “Game of Thrones” star Maisie Williams play alongside Tom Hiddleston in a new prehistoric-era adventure about inept cavemen from Oscar-winning director Nick Park. \nWilliams, who has read the scripts for the final season of “Game of Thrones”, told fans it would be worth the wait for the much-anticipated finale. \n“It’s going to be very very good, and it’s not going to come out for another year because it just takes long to make these incredible episodes that we’re doing and I am just so proud of the work everyone’s putting in this year. And honestly we have never done anything like this, it’s very special so it takes time but it’ll be worth it,” she said.
