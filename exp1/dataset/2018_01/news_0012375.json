On Tuesday, the dollar fell 0.39 percent against the yen. \n“All of last year there was this fantastic correlation between U.S. 10-year yields and dollar-yen and people put on what is known as pairs trades,” said Greg Anderson, global head of FX strategy at BMO Capital Markets in New York. \n“You could be long dollar-yen and you could be long U.S. treasuries and you were getting yield on both sides of that. But that correlation has broken apart fantastically over the last couple of days,” he said. \n“All those people that would have had that trade on are stopped out.” \nU.S. Treasury yields jumped to 10-month highs on Wednesday. \nSterling was slightly weaker against the greenback as investors locked in profits after its recent rally, though some decent economic data kept losses in check.
