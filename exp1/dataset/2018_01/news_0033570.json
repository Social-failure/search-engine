REUTERS/Dominic Ebenbichler \nDespite a big advantage, Kristoffersen held nothing back on his second run and nearly crashed when he lost control and at one point had both his skies in the air. \nBut he survived the scare and charged down the rest of the course, beating his chest and waving his skies in the air as he crossed the finish line. \nHirscher also saw his lead cut in the overall standings as he chases a seventh successive World Cup. He now has 1054 points, 154 clear of second-placed Kristoffersen with Aksel Lund Svindal third on 666.
