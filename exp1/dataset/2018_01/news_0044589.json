The FTC has five seats, and no more than three can be from one party. \nTrump has also said that he would nominate Rohit Chopra, a former official at the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, to be a Democratic member of the FTC. \nAnother White House spokeswoman said that Chopra’s nomination was also expected to be sent to the Senate shortly. \nThe expectation is that the two men would be confirmed before Ohlhausen leaves, according to a government official who spoke on background. \nIf not, only Terrell McSweeny, a Democrat, would remain. \nUnder the FTC statute, one commissioner can make decisions because there is no quorum requirement, the government official said. \nThe agency works with the Justice Department to enforce antitrust law and investigates allegations of deceptive behavior by companies. \nIt is currently reviewing a number of big mergers in industries where there are already few players. \nOne is a deal to merge industrial gases companies Praxair Inc and Linde AG. It will also decide if lens maker Essilor International SA will be allowed to merge with dominant frame-maker Luxottica Group SpA.
