During the meeting, Fed policy makers decided to raise short-term interest rates for a third time in 2017.\nAccording to the minutes, policymakers showed worry over the fate of currently low inflation and saw recent tax changes as providing a boost to consumer spending.\nFed officials also discussed the possibility that the Trump administration’s tax cuts or easy financial conditions could cause inflation pressures to rise, leading to some dollar-buying, analysts said.\n“The debate is the same. You have strong growth and low unemployment on one side and surprisingly low inflation on the other side,” said Stephen Stanley, chief economist at Amherst Pierpont Securities in Stamford, Connecticut.\n“They have been taking a middle-of-the-road on their policy approach, gradually raising interest rates and unwinding the balance sheet. They will continue the same tack.”\nThe dollar had already snapped a three-week losing streak earlier on Wednesday, after stronger-than-forecast U.S. manufacturing and construction data.\nThe Japanese yen weakened 0.18 percent versus the greenback at 112.50 per dollar, while Sterling GBP= was last trading at $1.3512, down 0.54 percent on the day.\nBenchmark U.S. Treasury 10-year notes US10YT=RR last rose 6/32 in price to yield 2.4452 percent, from 2.465 percent late on Tuesday.\nThe 30-year bond US30YT=RR last rose 18/32 in price to yield 2.7824 percent, from 2.81 percent late on Tuesday.\nSlideshow (2 Images) Hawkish comments from two European Central Bank officials had sent yields higher on Tuesday, with the 10-year German Bund yield DE10YT=RR hitting a two-month peak and the five-year U.S. yield US5YT=RR reaching its highest level since April 2011.\nWORLD STOCKS RISE MSCI’s gauge of stocks .MIWD PUS, which tracks shares in 47 countries, gained 0.46 percent. In 2017, the index’s best year since 2009, it set scores of record highs and rose by one-fifth in value.\nThe benchmark S&P 500 breached the 2,700-mark for the first time on Wednesday, while the Nasdaq Composite and the Dow Jones Industrial Average also broke records as tech stocks climbed amid indications of strong economic growth in the United States and abroad.\nWall Street held its gains after the release of minutes from the Fed’s policy meeting last month.\n“I think pretty much everyone sort of thinks the Fed is on track to do what it has been saying it is going to do, which is not do anything this month and then raise at their mid-March meeting. Currently there is about a 75-percent probability for a March hike. I don’t think anything that was said was outside of that assumption,” said Randy Frederick, vice president of trading at derivatives at Charles Schwab in Austin, Texas.\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJI rose 98.67 points, or 0.4 percent, to 24,922.68, the S&P 500 .SPX gained 17.25 points, or 0.64 percent, to 2,713.06 and the Nasdaq Composite .IXIC added 58.63 points, or 0.84 percent, to 7,065.53.\nIn Europe, shares closed higher after a rising dollar boosted exporters and Wall Street records lifted optimism as new European market rules took hold.

U.S. gold futures GCcv1 fell 0.09 percent to $1,314.90 an ounce.\nOil prices hit fresh two-and-a-half year highs, with a sixth day of unrest in OPEC member Iran and strong economic data from the United States and Germany spurring buying.\nU.S. crude CLcv1 rose 2.34 percent to $61.78 per barrel and Brent LCOcv1 was last at $67.89, up 1.98 percent on the day.\nReporting by Stephanie Kelly; Additional reporting by Abhinav Ramnarayan and Oleg Vukmanovic in London, Sruthi Shankar in Bengaluru, Richard Leong, Caroline Valetkevitch and Gertrude Chavez-Dreyfuss in New York, and Henning Gloystein in Singapore; Editing by Nick Zieminski\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-03T02:42:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-03T03:09:00.002+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
