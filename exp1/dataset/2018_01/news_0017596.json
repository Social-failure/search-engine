It is an access panel near the pylon connecting one of the engines to the right wing. \n“There was no sign of it on the runways so it’s going to be very difficult to locate,” the spokesman said. \nA recent string of incidents involving U.S. aircraft based on Japan’s southern island of Okinawa prompted Japan’s Defence Minister Itsunori Onodera on Tuesday to ask his U.S. counterpart James Mattis to implement measures that would prevent any recurrences. \nThose incidents, which included a window falling from a helicopter onto a school playground last month, have fuelled public opposition to the U.S. presence on the strategically located island at the edge of the East China Sea. \nThe air force would conduct an investigation to determine why the panel had fallen off Abe’s plane, the ASDF spokesman said. \nThe two government jumbos left Tokyo on Friday carrying Abe, government officials and Japanese business representatives on a six-day trip to Eastern Europe, including stops in Estonia, Lithuania, Serbia and Romania. \nAbe did not board the 747 that lost the panel. \nJapan has ordered two Boeing 777 planes to replace the ageing jumbos after March 2019. It also plans to switch to ANA Holdings for maintenance work from rival Japan Airlines Co..
