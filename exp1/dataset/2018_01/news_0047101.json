Of the 88 companies in the index that have posted results, 78.4 percent have topped expectations, while 72 percent had done so on average for the previous four quarters.\nS&P 500 e-minis were up 8 points, or 0.28 percent, with 125,450 contracts changing hands.\nNasdaq 100 e-minis were up 37 points, or 0.53 percent, in volume of 34,580 contracts.\nDow e-minis were up 62 points, or 0.24 percent, with 26,221 contracts changing hands.\nThe dollar was modestly lower against a basket of major currencies and held near three-year lows. The greenback suffered its biggest daily percentage drop in seven months on Wednesday after U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said he welcomed a weaker currency.\nEconomic data expected includes weekly jobless claims and reports on the housing market.\nFord Motor Co shares fell 0.8 percent to $$11.95 in premarket trading after the automaker posted a lower-than-expected quarterly net profit, hurt by rising commodity costs and unfavorable currency exchange rates, and said it expected more pain to come from higher raw material prices in 2018.\nU.S. President Donald Trump arrived in Switzerland on Thursday to attend the World Economic Forum, where he will push his “America First” agenda and seek more favorable trade policies for the United States in a speech scheduled for Friday.
