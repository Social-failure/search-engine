That prompted Cako to assert that his police had “uprooted cannabis” all over Albania. \nBut crime gangs continue to smuggle tonnes of cannabis on speedboats across the Adriatic to Italy, a situation the government statement indicated was unacceptable. \n“Police work should indispensably be driven towards tangible results to better respond to the requirements of this new stage and the high expectations of the people and our international partners,” the statement said. \nCako had no immediate comment on his firing, which came soon after the start of Socialist Prime Minister Edi Rama’s second term and amid an investigation against ex-interior minister Saimir Tahiri for alleged collusion with cannabis traffickers. \nCako was promoted to deputy national police chief in 2014 for his role in ending the open-air growing of cannabis on an industrial scale in the lawless southern village of Lazarat. \nBut over the next two years cannabis cultivation spread wildly all over the rugged Balkan country under Cako’s watch - he became national police chief when his boss resigned - though police said they had cut down more plants than ever before.
