Reports from survivors and government officials varied between 35 and 100 people.\nThe 17-metre (56-foot) catamaran was reported missing on Jan. 20, two days after it departed Nonouti Island on a 250 km (155 miles) trip to Betio in Kiribati.\nAustralia has sent a P-3 Orion surveillance aircraft to assist in the search and the U.S. Coastguard has sent a Hercules aircraft from Hawaii to scour the northern part of the search area.\nA New Zealand aircraft spotted a dinghy on Sunday with eight people, including a 14-year-old girl, who had been adrift for days without water. The eight were rescued by a fishing vessel.\nThey told rescuers they had scrambled into their tiny dinghy as the ferry disintegrated soon after setting off and that other passengers had made it into another dinghy and a liferaft.\nThe second dinghy had broken up and likely sunk, Craven said, with the search was now focusing on finding the liferaft.\nHe said rescuers’ main concern was that any survivors would be facing the heat for days without drinking water.\nReporting by Charlotte Greenfield; Additional reporting by Colin Packham in Sydney; Editing by Michael Perry\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-30T04:04:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-30T04:19:33.047+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
