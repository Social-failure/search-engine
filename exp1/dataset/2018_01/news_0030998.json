He owns roughly one-sixth of Berkshire, and is worth $91.5 billion according to Forbes magazine.\nReporting by Jonathan Stempel in New York; Editing by Lisa Shumaker\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-19T03:48:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-19T04:00:58.010+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
