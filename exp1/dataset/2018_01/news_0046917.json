Even Hitler’s use of body language helped to form public opinion.\nLuckert said the Nazi’s success came in part from people’s desire for conformity, which encouraged them to act differently in a group, for example, by supporting something they might not otherwise.\n“Propaganda works not just to change your opinion, but to change how you behave,” he said.\nThe exhibit is at the European Parliament until May 13.
