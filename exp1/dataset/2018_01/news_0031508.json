While working as registered nurses, they noticed a trend of nurses and healthcare professionals who had an interest in wound care but limited or non-existent access to specialized wound education. Morgan and Sardina decided to effect change by forming WCEI.\nWCEI conducts on-site and online courses, along with live and on-demand webinars. The institute's annual Wild On Wounds conference draws wound care clinicians from around the country.\nImpact of wound care education\n\"Skin is the largest organ in the body, and more than 6.5 million people in the U.S. suffer from chronic wounds,\" Morgan said. \"We have the ability to empower clinicians to make a difference in their patients' lives. Becoming part of OnCourse Learning, which educates clinicians in 20 different healthcare professions , allows us to meet the educational needs of many more professionals.\"\nAccording to a 2017 study published in the Value in Health journal, annual Medicare spending for all wound types is estimated between $28 billion and $32 billion. In 2015, the federal government began penalizing hospitals and healthcare facilities based on measures of adverse events, including wounds.\n\"Proper wound care is a major focus for our clients,\" said Ken Ramirez, OnCourse Learning's Executive Vice President, Healthcare. \"They recognize its importance and the impact it can have on the patient experience and the overall quality of care. Incorporating the WCEI curriculum into the OnCourse Learning library of offerings will accelerate the number of wound care certified clinicians and their impact on patient care.\"\nWound care training audience\nWCEI, which has 20 employees, has educated more than 25,000 professionals in skin and wound management, diabetic wounds and ostomy management since it was founded, including:\nRegistered nurses Licensed practical nurses Licensed vocational nurses Physicians Physical therapists Occupational therapists Nurse practitioners Advanced practice nurses Dieticians\nFor media inquiries, contact:\nBarry Bottino, Communications Director\n847-908-8007\n188861@email4pr.com\nAbout OnCourse Learning\nOnCourse Learning delivers licensure, regulatory and compliance education solutions throughout the nation's leading industries including financial services, healthcare and real estate.
