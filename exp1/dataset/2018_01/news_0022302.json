( bit.ly/2mDzQFB )\nPing An shares listed in Hong Kong jumped nearly 4 percent to a record on Monday.\nLufax declined to comment when contacted by Reuters. Ping An did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\nWith a $60 billion valuation, Lufax would become the second mega fintech share offering in Hong Kong after ZhongAn Online Property & Casualty Insurance Co Ltd ( 6060.HK ), which raised $1.5 billion in September, giving it a valuation of $13 billion.\nLufax is set to become China’s second most valuable fintech firm after Alibaba’s ( BABA.N ) affiliate, Ant Financial, which was valued at $75 billion by CLSA in 2016, the newspaper said.\nIn December, Lufax had mandated Citic Securities, Citigroup, JP Morgan, Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs as joint sponsors for the float, according to IFR, a Thomson Reuters publication.\nHong Kong is now set to allow dual-class shares under rule changes to be proposed by the city’s stock exchange as it raises the stakes in its battle against New York for blockbuster Chinese initial public offerings.\nSuch shares grant differentiated voting rights and underpin the alternative governance and shareholding structures favored by many owners of new age industries such as technology.\nReporting by Donny Kwok; Editing by Malcolm Foster\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-15T06:21:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-15T07:30:02.009+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
