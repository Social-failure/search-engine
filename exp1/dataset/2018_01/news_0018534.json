BOMWATCH2\nRamos predicted a hike to 7.50 percent at the bank’s February meeting, following the December one-quarter percentage point increase to 7.25 percent - unless the next inflation reading was positive or the next round of NAFTA negotiations have a peso-supporting outcome.\nConsumer prices MXINFL=ECI rose 0.59 percent in December, a six-year high for that month, according to non-seasonally adjusted figures.\nThe core index, which strips out some volatile food and energy prices, rose 0.42 percent during the month MXCPIX=ECI.\nMexico’s central bank targets inflation of 3 percent. Its board said recently it expects the rate to reach that goal slower than it had previously predicted.\nReporting by Anthony Esposito; Editing by David Gregorio, Jeffrey Benkoe and Susan Thomas\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-01-09T22:44:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-10T03:04:24.033+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
