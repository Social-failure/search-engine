FILE PHOTO - The company logo for Unilever is displayed on a screen on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) in New York, U.S., February 17, 2017. REUTERS/Brendan McDermid \nProduction of the condiment will likely start to be transferred this year to other British sites including Burton upon Trent, where Marmite and Bovril are made, with some packing moving to Germany, the company said on Thursday. \nThe decision follows a review launched in October when UK soft drink maker Britvic announced the closure of its Norwich factory, on a site co-owned with Unilever. \nBritvic’s decision had “serious implications” for Unilever, a company spokeswoman said in a statement. \nAbout 40 of the jobs will transfer to Burton, while 25 will be created in Norwich by a new facility for production and packing of Colman’s mustard powder, mustard milling and mint processing, Unilever said. The company will also continue to source its mint and mustard locally, it said. \nThe move comes as British businesses prepare for the country’s exit from the European Union, and as Unilever also reviews its dual-headed Anglo-Dutch structure. \n“The government is disappointed Unilever has decided to close its Norwich plant, though we welcome Unilever’s commitment to mustard milling and mint production in Norwich,” a spokesman for the British government said, adding that it will work closely with the company, local government officials and unions throughout the consultation period. \nJeremiah Colman began selling mustard near Norwich in 1814. His great-nephew Jeremiah James Colman established the factory there in 1858. Unilever acquired the business in 1995 from what is now Reckitt Benckiser.
