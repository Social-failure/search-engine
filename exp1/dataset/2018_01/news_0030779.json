REUTERS/Thomas Peter \nThe lights were duly switched on but once the bespectacled Chung took the fourth set, there only looked to be one winner. \nZverev, who is yet advance past the last 16 at a grand slam, double-faulted twice to gift Chung a break at the start of the fifth and when he dropped serve again two games later he demolished his racket, earning a warning. Slideshow (6 Images) \nThe end came quickly as Zverev capitulated, netting a backhand to hand Chung victory as he became only the third South Korean to reach the fourth round of a grand slam. \n“It was a really tough match, I was just trying to play 100 percent out there,” Chung, a year older than Zverev, said on court. \nHe will play either six-times champion Novak Djokovic or Albert Ramos-Vinolas in the next round.
