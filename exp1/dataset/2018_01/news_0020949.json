Currently, only 40 percent of military members have mental health coverage, he said.\nThe new order will cost about $200 million year to implement, money that will be diverted from the agencies’ current budgets, a senior administration official said.\nReporting By Steve Holland and Roberta Rampton; Editing by David Gregorio\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-09T18:09:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-09T18:26:35.015+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
