So far only a figure skating pair has secured a spot, though several other athletes could qualify through special places offered by the Olympic body.\nReporting by Karolos Grohmann; editing by John Stonestreet\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-11T14:06:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-11T14:15:34.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
