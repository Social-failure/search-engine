The admission wiped about $15 billion or 85 percent off its market value. \nThe firm’s chief executive also left. The chairman briefly took the reins before also stepping down. In January, the chief financial officer stepped down. \n“The supervisory board continues to keep the governance of the group under review and a number of candidates are in the process of being approached to strengthen the independence of the supervisory board,” the firm said in a statement. \nSteinhoff spun off its African chains last year to secure a higher rating for its developed market businesses and to give investors keen on exposure to Africa a chance to invest in STAR directly. \nIn December, STAR reported a 25 percent rise in full-year operating profit, thanks mainly to cost cuts and a strong showing at discount clothing chains. \n“STAR will continue to be a key part of the Steinhoff group and it is important to have a focused board and management team in place to maximise the potential of the business,” Steinhoff’s acting chair, Heather Sonn, said. \nBy 0843 GMT, shares in STAR rose 5.3 percent to 19.06 rand, while Johannesburg-listed shares of Steinhoff climbed 6.23 percent to 6.99 rand.
