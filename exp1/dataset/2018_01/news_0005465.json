They had worked on Reuters coverage of a crisis in the western state of Rakhine, where an estimated 655,000 Rohingya Muslims have fled from a fierce military crackdown on militants. \nThe two are due to appear in court on Wednesday. It will be their second appearance in court and the prosecutor could request that charges are filed against them. \n“We miss him and want him to be free,” said Thant Zin Soe, among a group of about a dozen of Wa Lone’s friends who knelt beneath the Sule Pagoda’s towering golden stupa, hands clasped before then, to chant a special Buddhist mantra.

REUTERS/Stringer \n“We believe that this mantra will set them free, that’s why we’re reciting it.” \nIn Myanmar, which is still in transition after almost half a century of strict military rule, shows of support for journalists and others who run afoul of the authorities are not common.
