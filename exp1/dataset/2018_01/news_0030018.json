So far this year, GMO Internet shares have been hit by a plunge in bitcoin. \nNoting that GMO Internet’s market value of 226 billion yen ($2 billion) falls short of the total of its eight listed subsidiaries at 292 billion yen ($2.6 billion), Oasis said it should be able to boost its value through better management. \n“We think the firm has a unique business model, being a rare Japanese internet firm with B2B focus, and has further room to grow,” said Takuya Shigaki, an analyst at Oasis. “But it has been valued cheaply in the market because of governance.” \nGMO Internet has an extensive range of businesses, with decision-making concentrated in its founder and CEO Masatoshi Kumagai, who owns more than 40 percent of the firm’s shares, Oasis said. \nThe fund is calling for the setting up of a nominations committee as well as the separation of the roles of president and chairperson, on the grounds that the firm needs a stronger board. \nOasis also proposed the firm abolish its anti-takeover measures that do not need approval at a shareholder meeting. \nHarumi Ishii, spokeswoman for GMO Internet, said the company had no immediate comment. \nOasis has been a shareholder in GMO Internet for more than six months and now holds more than five percent of its shares. The share price rose 28 percent last year, outperforming a 19.7 percent rise in the overall Japanese share market. $1 = 111.20 yen Reporting by Hideyuki Sano; Editing by Alexander Smith and Sam Holmes", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-19T07:44:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-19T08:44:23.001+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
