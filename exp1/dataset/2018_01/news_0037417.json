Athletics - IAAF Athletics Awards - Grimaldi Forum, Monaco - November 24, 2017 IAAF president Sebastian Coe during the awards REUTERS/Eric Gaillard \nThe source said the IOC had discussed the matter of Infantino and Coe, and a final decision had yet to be taken but they were “unlikely” to be proposed for membership. \nInfantino was elected head of FIFA in February 2016 to succeed scandal-plagued Sepp Blatter and lead the federation out of its biggest graft crisis. \nFormer double Olympic champion Coe took over the IAAF in August 2015 against a backdrop of doping and corruption among the organization’s most senior officials, severely damaging the organization’s credibility. \nCoe’s predecessor Lamine Diack is currently facing a bribery and embezzlement investigation in France while his son, Papa Massata Diack is banned for life from the sport. \nCoe triggered the ire of the IOC when the IAAF blocked Russian track and field athletes from competing at the Rio de Janeiro Olympics over the doping affair. \nThe IAAF banned the Russian athletics federation team, with only one athlete, who lived, trained and was tested in the united States allowed to compete in Rio. The IOC, however, left it to individual federations to clear Russians to compete in their sports at the Games. \nBoth Blatter and Diack were IOC members until 2015. Blatter’s predecessor at FIFA, Joao Havelange, was an IOC member from 1963 to 2011. Diack’s predecessor, Primo Nebiolo, also became an IOC member shortly after his election in 1999.
