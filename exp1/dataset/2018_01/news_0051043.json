In 2017 the company told suppliers it ultimately wanted orders delivered on time 95 percent of the time or they would pay a fine. The company hoped to add $1 billion to revenue by improving product availability at stores.\nWal-Mart has been implementing that goal in phases.\nIt will now require large suppliers to deliver full orders within a specified delivery window 85 percent of the time or face a fine of 3 percent of the cost of goods.\nPreviously, large suppliers had to hit a 75 percent threshold to avoid fines.\nFor smaller suppliers the delivery threshold will move to 50 percent, up from 33 percent. The change will take effect in April, Bratspies told Reuters.\nReporting by Nandita Bose in New York; Editing by Jeffrey Benkoe\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-30T15:18:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-30T15:28:08.002+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
