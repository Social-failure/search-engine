Most deaths are among babies and young children in the poorest parts of Africa. The WHO says that in 2016, some $2.7 billion was invested in global malaria control and elimination efforts.\nReporting by Kate Kelland; Editing by Alison Williams\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-24T16:25:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-24T16:43:55.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
