This performance raises concerns over their turnaround,” Research firm Inderes said on its Twitter account.\nStockmann cut its full-year outlook in September and followed up by posting an adjusted operating loss for the third quarter, hit by weak sales at its Lindex fashion chain.\nShares in the company fell as much as 4 percent after the announcement.
