It added that it banned military forces and officials from northern Yemen, including members of Hadi’s government, in southern provinces. \nOne of the main differences between the two sides is that the UAE, a key member of the Saudi-led coalition, is hostile towards Islamists, but Hadi’s cabinet is formed mostly by the Islah party, seen as linked with the Muslim Brotherhood. \nThe new spat could jeopardize a rare opportunity offered by the killing of former president Ali Abdullah Saleh last month, that Saudi Arabia intended to seize to isolate the Houthi movement. \nSouthern forces have previously clashed with Hadi supporters, including members of Islah party, over control of strategic areas, including Aden airport and oil facilities. \nWith thousands of fighters deployed on battlefronts against the Houthis, Islah has been an important ally of Hadi and the Saudi-led coalition trying to reinstate his government. \nSince the coalition intervened in Yemen, Islah has tried to distance itself from the Brotherhood in an effort to ease Gulf rulers’ anxiety about its Islamist ideology.
