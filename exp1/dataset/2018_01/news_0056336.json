(\"Aegean\" or, the \"Company\") (NYSE: ANW), announced today that it has formally nominated four highly qualified independent candidates for election to the Company's Board of Directors (the \"Board\") at the upcoming 2018 annual meeting of shareholders.\nTyler Baron issued the following statement on behalf of the Committee:\n\"As the Committee highlighted in its open letter to the Board dated December 20, 2017, the present state of corporate governance at the Company is untenable and change is desperately needed. The current members of the Board have presided over a dramatic erosion of shareholder value â€“ a 58% decline in the share price over the past year and a 71% decline since the Company's IPO eleven years ago. There are also significant concerns over the Board's independence and accountability; of the four seated directors, three were appointed by the founder at the time of the IPO or shortly thereafter. Furthermore, despite the founder no longer owning any interest in the Company, we believe he retains significant influence over its activities. These concerns are exacerbated by historical and ongoing related party transactions with entities controlled by the founder. The need for direct and independent shareholder representation on the Board is crucial to restore a corporate governance structure that is aligned with the interests of all shareholders.\"\nThe Committee sees significant value in Aegean's fuel distribution network and the assets that support it, and believes the optionality and strategic importance of this network will grow as the industry approaches the significant changes brought by IMO 2020 regulations less than two years away. The Committee estimates the Company's quick-turning net working capital balance alone, less associated debt, amounts to more than $330MM of equity value. In addition, the fleet of modern vessels and the Fujairah storage terminal have a combined book value of more than $310MM. After deducting outstanding bonds net of cash, the book value of just the Company's three principal assets is approximately $12 per share. Furthermore, using average EBITDA over the past four years and deducting current cash interest expense, capital expenditures, and taxes, the Company would generate approximately $1.50 per share in annual operational free cash flow. Yet the Company trades at deeply discounted multiples relative to both its net asset value and operational free cash flow due to persistent concerns about corporate governance, conflicts of interest and management competence.\nWhile the potential for operational improvement and value creation at Aegean is substantial, there is much work to be done and value will only be unlocked by implementing and successfully executing against a long-term strategic plan. The Committee believes fresh Board members with areas of expertise well-suited to the challenges and opportunities facing the Company are required to formulate and oversee the execution of this plan.\nFor the past nine months members of the Committee have pursued a private and constructive dialogue with the aim of upgrading corporate governance, enhancing the existing Board, and improving the financial performance of the Company. Unfortunately, the response from the Board has ranged from indifference to entrenchment. Accordingly, the Committee has today formally nominated four highly qualified candidates for election at the Company's 2018 annual meeting of shareholders.\nAs can be seen from the detailed biographies that follow, this group of impressive candidates possesses complementary skillsets and expertise including global marine fuel market knowledge, operations, corporate finance, restructuring, corporate governance, capital markets, and strategy. Importantly, these nominees, if elected, will work with the singular focus of best representing the interests of all shareholders.\nThe Committee's nominees include:\nRaymond Bartoszek\nMr. Bartoszek has over 20 years of experience as an oil trader specializing in the supply of marine bunker fuels to global shipping companies, first at Texaco and then at Glencore Ltd. While at Glencore Ltd. he held a number of senior management positions including Managing Director and head of its oil department where he managed a global team and portfolio of assets. Mr. Bartoszek was one of the firm's directors leading up to the successful IPO in 2011. Following his time at Glencore, Mr. Bartoszek started a family office called RLB Holdings. He currently serves on the board of several private companies, and is a Limited Partner of the New York Yankees. He is also the Managing Partner of Horseheads Sand and Transloading Terminal, an energy terminal that supplies well operations in the Marcellus Shale. Mr. Bartoszek holds a M.B.A. with a focus in International Business from Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute and a Dual-Major B.S. degree from the U.S. Merchant Marine Academy.\nDonald Moore\nMr. Moore has over 40 years of experience in the financial services industry at Morgan Stanley, most recently as Chairman of Morgan Stanley Group (Europe) from 2000-2016 and as Global Chairman of the Financial Institutions Group from 2013-2016.

Prior to moving to Europe in 1997, Mr. Moore worked on over 120 transactions spanning 22 years in New York, including most of the landmark banking transactions such as Citicorp on their restructuring and recapitalization in 1990.

Mr. Moore attended the London School of Economics and holds a B.A. with Honors from Pomona College and a M.B.A. from Harvard Graduate School of Business Administration.\nDavid Kirshner\nMr. Kirshner has more than 30 years of management experience in the fuels industry, most recently as Chairman and CEO of Axeon Specialty Products LLC, a $1B asphalt and specialty petroleum products marketing and refining company where he led an extensive operational turnaround from 2014-2017 that resulted in the successful sale of a majority of the business. Previously, Mr. Kirshner was Senior Vice President of Commercial at Tesoro Corporation from 2011-2014 where he managed teams that traded and marketed bunker fuels and was a member of the Executive Committee. Prior to that, Mr. Kirshner was Vice President of Supply, Trading, and Transportation at Hess Corporation where he also focused on the supply and trading of bunker fuels and was a member of the Marketing and Refining Leadership Team.
