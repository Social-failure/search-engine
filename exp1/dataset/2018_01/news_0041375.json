Fears of a wider clampdown pushed bitcoin down nearly 20 percent last week.\nYamaoka said while there were some “speculative moves” in the cryptocurrency market, it was hard to say whether bitcoin was experiencing a bubble because cryptocurrencies have no underlying assets to measure their real value.\nIt will also be hard to define which cryptocurrency needs to be regulated and for countries to agree on a uniform set of rules, given it isn’t easy to come up with common regulations even for traditional banking services, he said.\nHiromi Yamaoka of the Bank of Japan's (BOJ) speaks at an interview with Reuters at his office in Tokyo, Japan, October 4, 2016. REUTERS/Kim Kyung-Hoon “It’s uncertain whether global cooperation would mean global regulation...It may mean sharing a common view on the risks involved in cryptocurrency trading and seeking to send out a common message,” he said. “Global harmonization may not necessarily mean global regulation.”\nNO MAJOR PROBLEMS SO FAR France has urged for debate on bitcoin at a meeting of G20 major economies in Argentina in March. Germany has also said any attempt to regulate cryptocurrencies must be on a global scale.\nYamaoka said while cryptocurrency prices have been volatile, they have yet to disrupt Japan’s banking system as cryptocurrencies are hardly used for payments and settlements.\nAs long as they are not used much for payments and settlements, they won’t affect monetary policy much, he said.\nBut policymakers need to check how much exposure banks have, how much funds are investing in them globally, and how much leverage investors are taking, Yamaoka added.\n“So far, I don’t think there are any big problems. But we need to look carefully,” he said.\n“If the exposures turn out to be huge, we may need to follow up and work to maintain financial stability together with the Financial Services Agency.”\nJapan’s global share of the bitcoin market jumped after a clampdown last year by Beijing. The government in April granted cryptocurrencies legal status as a means of settlement and recognized several digital currency exchanges.\nAdditional reporting by Yoshifumi Takemoto; Editing by Jacqueline Wong\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-25T11:06:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-25T11:27:45.085+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
