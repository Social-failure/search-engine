His diplomatic career was cut short after the war and his actions remained largely unknown in Japan for decades after the conflict ended. \nMost of Lithuania’s Jewish population – about 200,000 people – were shot dead in first few months after Nazi Germany occupied its territory in June 1941, ending centuries of the thriving culture.
