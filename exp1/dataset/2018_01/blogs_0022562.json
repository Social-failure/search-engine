However, IS continues to carry out attacks and bombings in Baghdad and different parts of the country.\nThe German foreign ministry condemned the devastating attack in Baghdad and expressed its condolences to the families of those killed.\nThe attack in Aviation Square was one of the deadliest in Baghdad since a massive truck bomb killed at least 324 people in the nearby commercial district of Karrada in July 2016.\nThe Karrada bombing was the deadliest single attack in Iraq since the 2003 U.S.-led invasion that ousted Saddam Hussein.\nReporting by Maher Chmaytelli and Ahmed Rasheed; Editing by Mark Heinrich\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-15T08:17:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-15T08:30:07.018+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
