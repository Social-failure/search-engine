They each made a 3-point basket, while Carter shared game-high honors with eight rebounds.\nGary Trent Jr. added 17 points and Grayson Allen dumped in 16 points for Duke (17-2, 5-2 ACC), which has won four games in a row and is unbeaten in 10 home games this season.\nParker Stewart’s 15 points and Marcus Carr’s 12 points paced last-place Pittsburgh (8-12, 0-7).
