They are assisting some 275 athletes and as many as 60,000 U.S. citizens. \nColon and other officials said organising security for the South Korea games was no different than that of other Olympics, despite the tensions with Pyongyang. \nThe security officials said they were unaware of any specific threats and were confident that the South Koreans can provide a secure Olympics. They noted Seoul hosted the 2014 Asian games and the 2002 FIFA world cup. \n“We have planned for all contingencies, and when I say all contingencies, you think about it, I mean we’re only less than a hundred miles (200 km) from North Korea,” said Michael Evanoff, the assistant secretary for diplomatic security. “So we’ve planned for all contingencies.” Reporting by David Alexander; Editing by David Gregorio", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-31T21:38:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-31T22:11:41.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
