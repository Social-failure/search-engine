I know I‘m not owed anything but confidence certainly make it easier to play well.” \nVegas is also coming off a good year during which he climbed into the top 50 in the world, with he hopes more to come. \nLike Leishman, he knows he can beat the best when he hits it straight. \n“It’s a big key for my game to drive it well,” Vegas said. \n”I hit my irons as well as some of the best on tour and if I‘m able to keep it in play, and give myself good positions to attack hole locations I‘m going to get a lot of birdie opportunities. \n“Last year was pretty good year for me, moved into top 50 in the world. This year I want to move even higher, somewhere in the 20s.” (Reporting by Andrew Both in Cary, North Carolina; editing by Amlan Chakraborty)", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-05T05:48:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-05T06:13:51.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
