Ukrainian opposition figure and Georgian former President Mikheil Saakashvili (C) addresses the media and his supporters after a court hearing in Kiev, Ukraine January 3, 2018. REUTERS/Valentyn Ogirenko \nGeorgia said it would seek the extradition of Saakashvili, who was president from 2004-2013, from Ukraine where he is an active opposition figure and has had violent brushes with authorities. \nA court in the Georgian capital Tbilisi found Saakashvili guilty of abusing his presidential powers by trying to cover up evidence about the 2006 murder of banker Sandro Girgvliani and pardoning four men convicted of the killing. \nSaakashvili called the verdict illegal. \n“The ‘verdict’ of the Georgian court ... against me is completely illegal and contradicts all international, national norms and common sense,” Saakashvili wrote on his Facebook page on Friday. \nUkraine said it would consider Georgia’s extradition request though legal procedures would have to be followed. \n“Prosecutors are in the process of arranging a date for Saakashvili’s questioning due to Georgia’s request to extradite him,” Andriy Lysenko, spokesman for the Ukrainian prosecutor general, told Reuters by phone in Kiev. \nThe 50-year-old Saakashvili, a mercurial figure, moved to Ukraine in 2014. \nHis support for Ukraine’s pro-Europe Maidan movement, which forced a Russian-backed president to flee the country, won him favour from incoming President Petro Poroshenko who appointed him governor of the Black Sea Odessa region. \nBut he has fallen out badly with his former patron in Ukraine after accusing him of corruption and is under suspicion of assisting a criminal organisation, which he denies. \nHe attracts big crowds to rallies in Ukraine and there have been occasional violent clashes between his supporters and police in Kiev.
