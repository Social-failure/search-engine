It is our responsibility to ensure that they are working as intended and - given the breadth and complexity of this new body of regulation - it is inevitable that we will be able to improve them, especially with the benefit of experience and hindsight.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-19T20:19:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-19T21:54:35.002+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
