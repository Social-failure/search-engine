Bus, subway and city rail services were disrupted and some flights were grounded as workers went on strike to protest against the bill.\n“Parliament shouldn’t approve these measures. The government must take them back. They have exhausted us,” said 55-year-old Georgia Koutsoukou, one of the demonstrators.\nAs the vote was in progress, police fired teargas to disperse protesters who hurled stones and petrol bombs at them. The unrest was brief.\nFlares thrown by hooded protesters are lit in front of riot police during a demonstration against planned government reforms that will restrict workers rights to strike in Athens, Greece, January 15, 2018.

Business owners and Greece’s creditors hope the measure will limit the frequency of strikes and improve productivity, which lags about 20 percent behind the European Union average.\nAdditional reporting by Lefteris Papadimas and Karolina Tagaris; Editing by Robin Pomeroy\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-15T10:25:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-15T10:45:04.019+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
