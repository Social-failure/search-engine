It also cut battery replacement costs and said it would change its software to show users whether their phone batteries were working well.\nThe Shanghai Consumer Council, a non-government organization approved by the Chinese authorities, said it had received 2,615 complaints about Apple products and services in 2017, compared with 964 complaints in 2015.\n(Reporting by John Ruwitch; Editing by Eric Meijer)", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-16T01:57:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-16T08:05:26.005+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
