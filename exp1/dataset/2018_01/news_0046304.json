That’s putting pressure on Kimberly-Clark , which announced a broad restructuring that would eliminate over 5,000 jobs. \nBoth manufacturers have seen a market slowdown in recent months—and in order to win back customers, P&G last year began widespread discounting, initially in its razor division to compete with companies like Dollar Shave Club, and later in the healthcare and household goods areas. \nThose price cuts are affecting sales at competitors including Kimberly-Clark and Johnson & Johnson , which is forcing them to adjust pricing as well. \nThe declining U.S. birthrate is also a factor, pushing demand for items like diapers lower, which is resulting in further price cuts. Kimberly-Clark , which manufactures the Huggies diaper brand, says the situation is not as bad as it was in the 1990s.
