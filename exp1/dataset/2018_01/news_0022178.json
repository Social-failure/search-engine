Analysts also believe inflation, which hovered around the 2 percent target for most of last year, will dip again in the months ahead. \nAt its last meeting, the Riksbank held rates steady and said net new bond purchases would end, though some reinvestments would be brought forward, meaning its balance sheet will swell temporarily. \nOhlsson and Deputy Governor Martin Floden voted against bringing forward reinvestments.
