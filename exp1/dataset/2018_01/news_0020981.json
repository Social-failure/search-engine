Nobody was injured.\nHowever, the tourist office said there was no reason for concern in Zermatt. Town officials say the airlift service was just arranged for those wishing to leave.\n“Power has returned, there’s still the chance that it could go out ... but at this time things look good,” a tourist office spokeswoman said. “The atmosphere in the village is relaxed and comfortable.”\nHelicopters flew for about two hours on Tuesday afternoon, she said.\nGuests seeking to leave the car-free village at the foot of the Matterhorn were flown to Taesch, about 5 km (3 miles) away.\nFrom there, Zermatt had enlisted buses in place of rail service to take people further down the valley following the opening of the road. Helicopters were also used to transport people seeking to reach Zermatt, officials said.\nSwiss mountain communities have been in the spotlight for geological risks since August, when the side of a mountain collapsed in the southern canton of Grisons, killing eight hikers. Their bodies have not been found.\nReporting by John Miller; Editing by Alison Williams\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-09T18:19:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-09T18:37:26.046+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
