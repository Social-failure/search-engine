REUTERS/Vincent Kessler \nComments by German Chancellor Angela Merkel in Davos that Britain could have as close a relationship as it wanted were both very reassuring and very significant, Varadkar said. \nSuch an outcome would also mean Ireland would not have to ask the EU for specific assistance in dealing with the economic fallout from Brexit, he added. Varadkar and his predecessor Enda Kenny had said previously a request for aid was likely. \nAfter U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin’s welcoming of a weaker dollar on Wednesday took centre stage on world markets, Varadkar said concerns around the Swiss Alps resort of a currency war had been excessively heightened and was unlikely to transpire. \n“I would ask the question to anyone who is considering a trade war or a currency war - who’s ever won one? All that happens when you go down that road in terms of policy is that everyone ends up worse off,” he said.
