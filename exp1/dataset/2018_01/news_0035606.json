Borshoff left the company in 2015 after 22 years and is now managing director at uranium explorer Deep Yellow Ltd.\nHe says there is complacency at utilities who assume that, even if they squeeze producers to the bone now, they will be able to secure uranium at less than the $73 a pound it cost before Fukushima.\nNuclear utilities are typically indifferent to fluctuations in prices, historically securing contracts when the price of uranium is high, because the metal accounts for just 5 percent of their total expenses.\nThat always carries risks in an industry that often must put reliability above price.\n“Utilities think that if they put a price at $60 a pound, they’ll get product,” Borshoff said. “I‘m saying that when the shortage occurs, they can put it at $100 and they won’t get product.”\nReporting by Yashaswini Swamynathan in Bengaluru; Editing by Sriraj Kalluvila\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-01-23T00:27:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-22T19:12:32.014+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
