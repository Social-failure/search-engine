The government has reduced its expenditures by lifting some subsidies in recent years following a collapse in oil prices in mid-2014. \nTo boost revenue, the tiny-island nation imposed an excise tax on tobacco products, energy drinks and soft drinks this year. \nBahrain's reforms follow both Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, which have reduced gasoline subsidies, introduced similar excise taxes and added a 5 percent tax on most goods and services.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-08T14:50:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-08T19:12:13.018+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
