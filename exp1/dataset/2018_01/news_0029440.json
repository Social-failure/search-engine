I was telling the last day it was always difficult to play for me here, so I‘m really, really happy.” \nBenneteau, ranked 59th in the world, was struggling with dehydration five games into the second set and eventually lost his cool as he bemoaned a lack of electrolyte drinks on Hisense Arena. \n“Where is my drink,” Benneteau asked. “I don’t care... I don’t play without my drink. It’s not my fault.” \nTwo games later, Benneteau let his frustration boil over at the chair umpire as the volunteers searched for the drinks. \n“It’s unbelievable, you don’t do anything except to give me a warning,” he added. \nBenneteau ended up losing the second set before dropping the third as the incident appeared to unsettle him. \nThe 36-year-old eventually shrugged off the issue with a counter-punching approach to the fourth set, claiming two breaks of serve against Fognini to force a decider. \nFognini, however, found another gear to clinch the final set and set up a last 16 clash against big-serving Czech Tomas Berdych.
