It is tearing apart the diverse social fabric and the culture of tolerance that hold communities together.”Hawkins said UNICEF was also helping children of alleged IS militants now in detention by providing comfort and legal aid, and is trying to reunite those separated from their families, including those abroad.\nThe issue of civilians uprooted from Sunni Muslim areas previously under control of Sunni IS jihadists has become the latest bone of sectarian-tinged political contention in Iraq.\nSunni politicians are lobbying for postponing parliamentary elections due in May to allow the displaced to return to their hometowns to cast their ballots there.\nShi‘ite Muslim politicians including Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi insist on the vote taking place as planned on May 12.\nThe United States called on Thursday for the elections to be held on time, saying that delaying them “set a dangerous precedent, undermining the constitution and damaging Iraq’s long-term democratic development”.\nReporting by Stephanie Nebehay in Geneva; writing by Maher Chmaytelli in Baghdad; editing by Mark Heinrich\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-01-19T21:31:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-20T17:34:31.003+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
