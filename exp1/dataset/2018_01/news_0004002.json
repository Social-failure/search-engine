REUTERS/Mohamed Azakir Though Lebanon still faces daunting challenges, it has seen some progress over the past year despite continued conflict in neighboring Syria and rising tensions elsewhere in the region. \nIts squabbling politicians clinched a deal that ended a two-and-a-half-year period without a state president and installed a new government under Prime Minister Saad al-Hariri. The government also approved its first budget in 12 years and awarded its first offshore oil land gas exploration licenses. \nIn August, Islamic State and other militants were cleared from the Lebanon-Syria border area after separate offensives by the Lebanese army and Lebanon’s powerful Hezbollah militia. \nLebanese army soldiers remove a concrete block in downtown Beirut, Lebanon January 3, 2018.

He subsequently withdrew the resignation and the government resumed business as usual. \nReporting by Lisa Barrington; Editing by Gareth Jones\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-03T20:37:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-04T00:13:45.005+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
