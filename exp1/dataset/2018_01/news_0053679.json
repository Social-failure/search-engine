Information services rose 7 percent, not including acquisition-related gains. \nNasdaq also closed its $705 million purchase of investment analytics provider eVestment in the fourth quarter, giving it additional institutional investment data and analytics to bolster its information services unit. \nOverall, Nasdaq reported net income of $246 million, or $1.45 per share, in the fourth quarter ended Dec. 31, compared with a loss of $224 million, or $1.35 per share, a year ago. \nOn an adjusted basis, the company earned $1.05 per share, beating the average estimate of analysts by 5 cents, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. \nThe fourth quarter included a decrease in tax expenses of about $87 million related to the remeasurement of deferred tax liability due to the new U.S. tax law. \nOperating expenses rose 1.6 percent from a year earlier to $392 million. \nRevenue, excluding transaction-based expenses, rose 6 percent to $635 million, beating Wall Street estimates of $630.4 million.
