With a healthy, balanced and diversified offer, FoodChéri targets both individuals and companies, over 200 of which now look to the start-up to provide meals for their employees.\nKey differentiating factors for FoodChéri are:\nIn-house cooking, while many competitors subcontract food preparation; in 2018 FoodChéri will invest in a new 2,000 m2 kitchen; An offer focused on fresh, healthy food; half the menu is vegetarian, and all ingredients are sustainable including Label Rouge meat and organic vegetables sourced from local suppliers.\nSodexo believes the consumer experience of the future will be underpinned by flexibility, nomadism, simplicity and hyper-responsiveness.

Our commitments to cooking in-house and a streamlined supply chain have made us very agile.
