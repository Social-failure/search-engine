But \"essential services\" dealing with public safety and national security would continue.\nThe 2018 fiscal year began last Oct. 1. Congress' inability to agree on overall funding levels has meant that the government has been operating on a series of temporary measures that mainly kept spending at the previous year's levels.\n(Reporting by Richard Cowan and Amanda Becker; Editing by Peter Cooney)", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-19T03:40:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-19T05:10:28.016+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
