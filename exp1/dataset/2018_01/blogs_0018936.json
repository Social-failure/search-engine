The Journal said its reporters had viewed the records of more than 100 customers, including 50 lockbox codes, but that new records had appeared at least every day, meaning the total number could potentially be much larger. \nWag told The Journal the posts were due to a technical glitch in the software that had exposed “certain limited personal information belonging to a small subset of Wag users,” and was reaching out to those who had been impacted. The company told the Journal there was no evidence the information had been “misused” and that no customers’ homes had been burglarized.
