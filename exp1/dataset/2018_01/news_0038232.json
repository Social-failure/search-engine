Exports, a key driver of Thailand's growth, increased 8.6 percent in December from a year earlier after jumping 13.4 percent in November, commerce ministry data showed on Monday. That missed the median forecast of a 10.65 percent rise from economists polled by Reuters. The export gains were led by cars, computers and parts and rubber. Imports in December rose 16.6 percent from a year earlier after increasing 13.7 percent in November, and more than the forecast of a 10.35 percent rise. That resulted in a trade deficit of $0.28 billion in December, the first deficit since July 2017, compared with a forecast of $1.1 billion surplus. In 2017, exports grew 9.9 percent, while imports jumped 14.71 percent, giving a trade surplus of $13.9 billion, Pimchanok Vonkhorporn, an official at the commerce ministry, said at a briefing. The ministry expects export growth of 5-7 percent this year. Shipments rebounded last year, despite the baht strengthening 9 percent against the dollar. In 2016, exports rose just 0.5 percent after three years of contraction.
