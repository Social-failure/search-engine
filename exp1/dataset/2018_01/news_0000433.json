Energy submitted the most competitive prices in a tender to supply Pakistan with four LNG cargoes in March.\nEditing by David Evans\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-01-02T22:59:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-02T18:15:07.009+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
