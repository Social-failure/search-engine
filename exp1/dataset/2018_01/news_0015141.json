Italy's Prime Minister Paolo Gentiloni embraces French President Emmanuel Macron at the end of a news conference at Chigi palace in Rome, Italy, January 11, 2018, REUTERS/Max Rossi \nMacron told reporters at the end of a two-day visit to Rome that he had no intention of interfering in the Italian ballot, which is set for March 4. But his comments left little doubt over where his sympathies lay. \n“It is up to Italians to decide how to vote, but let me say that Europe has been very lucky to have Gentiloni and I hope we can continue the work that we have started,” he told a news conference, standing alongside the Italian leader. \nGentiloni’s Democratic Party (PD) is trailing in the opinion polls to both the anti-establishment 5-Star Movement and a centre-right bloc that includes the far-right Northern League party and the nationalist Brothers of Italy. \nAll the main opposition parties are seen as hostile to Brussels to various degrees and all are seeking significant changes to EU budget rules. The League is also pushing for Italy to quit the euro currency, although its partners reject this.

On Thursday he again stressed the importance of a united and purposeful Europe. \n“Can I say that the European Union is positive for Italy, and can I also say that an Italy which believes in Europe is positive for Europe,” Macron said.
