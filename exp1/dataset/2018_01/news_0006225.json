Investors were watching U.S. non-farm payrolls data due later on Friday.\nEuro zone stocks were set for a weekly gain of 2.7 percent.\nMarkets outside of the euro zone saw several record levels broken. Switzerland's blue chip SMI .SSMI index rose 0.4 percent to an all-time high, while Britain's FTSE 100 .FTSE jumped to another record.\nFinancials drove gains in Europe on the day, with the banking index .SX7P rising 0.6 percent.\n“More than cyclicals we are looking for lower valued areas like banks, telecoms, energy,” John Surplice, pan-European equities fund manager at Invesco Perpetual, said.\n“The areas we are cautious on are the ones we would deem bond proxy sectors - regulated utilities, food and beverage, long duration assets that have been re-priced significantly during the crisis,” Surplice added.\nEuropean autos .SXAP was the top-performing sector, up 1.4 percent, while every other sector traded in positive territory.\nShares in Fiat Chrysler ( FCHA.MI ), Peugeot ( PEUP.PA ) and Volkswagen ( VOWG_p.DE ) were among the biggest gainers, up 2.8 percent to 4.2 percent.\nHowever, shares in British car insurer Admiral Group ( ADML.L ) tumbled around 5 percent to the bottom of the STOXX on the back of a downgrade from JPMorgan as well as some weak UK new car sales data.\nDialog Semiconductor ( DLGS.DE ) was another underperformer, down 4 percent after top customer Apple ( AAPL.O ) said that its products were hit by a chip flaw.\nTo view a graphic on European Stocks verses the Euro, click: reut.rs/2CXoV0f\nReporting by Kit Rees and Helen Reid; Editing by Tom Pfeiffer and Alison Williams\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-05T10:37:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-05T10:50:42.059+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
