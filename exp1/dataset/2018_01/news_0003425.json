As part of that deal, GIC, a sovereign wealth fund established by the government of Singapore to manage the nation’s foreign reserves, will also subscribe to at least 352 million reais of new shares. \nIn the interview, Garcia said that while the IPO had been cancelled, the company planned to go public at some point in the future. $1 = 3.24 reais Reporting by Gram Slattery; Editing by Mark Potter", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-04T13:40:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-04T14:10:53.003+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
