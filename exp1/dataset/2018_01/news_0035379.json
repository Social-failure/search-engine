We have entered into the largest acquisition in our company's history with a bolt on to our high-quality Eagle Ford position in a leverage neutral manner by divesting of a small portion of our Altamont acreage. During the year, we also entered into two drilling joint ventures, which increased capital efficiency. We continue to explore opportunities within each program to further increase asset performance and returns. As we look ahead, 2018 will be a year in which we blend fresh concepts and explore new opportunities across the company to drive higher value for all of our stakeholders.\"\n2017 Preliminary Results\nEP Energy expects to achieve its 2017 production target with preliminary equivalent production of 82.3 MBoe/d, including 46.1 MBbls/d of oil production for the year ended December 31, 2017. The company had approximately $700 million of liquidity at December 31, 2017 pro forma for the debt exchange completed in January 2018.\nHedge Program Update\nEP Energy has a substantial portion of 2018 oil volumes hedged with a floor of $58.46 per barrel. The company's hedge structures allow for significant upside participation as WTI prices rise. Approximately two-thirds of 2018 oil exposure is open to upward price moves above current strip.\nA summary of the company's 2018 and 2019 hedge positions is listed below:\n2018\n2019\nOil volumes (MMBbls)\n14.94\n0.73\nAverage ceiling price ($/Bbl)\n$\n63.96\n$\n55.88\nAverage floor price ($/Bbl)\n$\n58.46\n$\n55.88\nNatural gas volumes (TBtu)\n25.55\n7.30\nAverage ceiling price ($/MMBtu)\n$\n3.04\n$\n2.97\nAverage floor price ($/MMBtu)\n$\n3.04\n$\n2.97\nNote: Positions are as of January 10, 2018 (Contract months: January 1, 2018 - Forward). If market prices settle at or below $50.00 in 2018, EPE will receive a \"locked-in\" cash settlement of the market price plus $10.00 per Bbl. As of December 31, 2017, the average forward price of oil was $59.31 per Bbl for 2018.\n2018 Outlook\nCapital Program\nIn 2018, EP Energy expects capital spending to range from $600 million to $650 million and meaningfully grow Adjusted EBITDAX 1 . Included in this range, the company has allocated approximately 10 percent of its spending for new concepts. Approximately 50 percent of the company's capital program is allocated to the Eagle Ford, 30 percent to the Permian and 20 percent to the Altamont.\n1 See non-GAAP terms for definition\nProduction Volumes\nEquivalent production in 2018 is expected to range from 81 MBoe/d to 87 MBoe/d with 46 MBbls/d to 50 MBbls/d of oil production.\nOperations\nDuring 2018, EP Energy expects to run a five-rig program with one to two rigs in the Eagle Ford, one rig in the Permian and two rigs in the Altamont program.\nIn the Eagle Ford, the company maintains a highly efficient capital program. In December 2017, the company announced an acquisition that will add current production volumes and expand its acreage position by 26 percent. The transaction, which is expected to close in early February, will increase future drilling inventory across its large contiguous position and allow for operational synergies.\nIn the Permian, the company will continue to focus on improving well performance across its acreage and reducing operating costs.\nIn the Altamont, the company expects to continue its drilling joint venture and to expand its capital efficient recompletion program in 2018.\nIn 2018, EP Energy expects to increase cash flow 1 with increased capital efficiencies and reduced operating costs.

In the event of such a disclosure or release, Regulation G requires (i) the presentation of the most directly comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP and (ii) a reconciliation of the differences between the non-GAAP financial measure presented and the most directly comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP.\nNon-GAAP Terms\nEBITDAX is defined as net income (loss) plus interest and debt expense, income taxes, depreciation, depletion and amortization and exploration expense. Adjusted EBITDAX is defined as EBITDAX, adjusted as applicable in the relevant period for the net change in the fair value of derivatives (mark-to-market effects of financial derivatives, net of cash settlements and cash premiums related to these derivatives), the non-cash portion of compensation expense (which represents non-cash compensation expense under these programs adjusted for cash payments made under these plans), transition, restructuring and other costs that affect comparability, gains and losses on extinguishment/modification of debt and impairment charges.\nEBITDAX and Adjusted EBITDAX are used by management and we believe provide investors with additional information (i) to evaluate our ability to service debt adjusting for items required or permitted in calculating covenant compliance under our debt agreements, (ii) to provide an important supplemental indicator of the operational performance of our business without regard to financing methods and capital structure, (iii) for evaluating our performance relative to our peers, (iv) to measure our liquidity (before cash capital requirements and working capital needs) and (v) to provide supplemental information about certain material non-cash and/or other items that may not continue at the same level in the future. In addition, the company believes that these measures are widely used by professional research analysts and others in the valuation, comparison and investment recommendations of companies in the oil and gas exploration and production industry.\nEBITDAX and Adjusted EBITDAX have limitations as analytical tools and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under U.S. GAAP. EBITDAX and Adjusted EBITDAX should not be used as an alternative to net income (loss), operating income (loss), operating cash flows or other measures of financial performance or liquidity presented in accordance with GAAP. Our presentation of EBITDAX and Adjusted EBITDAX may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies in our industry. Furthermore, our presentation of EBITDAX and Adjusted EBITDAX should not be construed as an inference that our future results will be unaffected by the items noted above or what we believe to be other unusual items, or that in the future we may not incur expenses that are the same as or similar to some of the adjustments in this presentation.\nAdjusted general and administrative expenses are defined as general and administrative expenses excluding the non-cash portion of compensation expense which represents compensation expense under our long-term incentive programs adjusted for cash payments under these plans. This non-GAAP measure is used by management and investors as additional information as noted above and is subject to the same limitations of analytical tools as noted above and should not be considered as a GAAP substitute for general and administrative expense.\nCautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\nThis release includes certain forward-looking statements and projections of EP Energy.
