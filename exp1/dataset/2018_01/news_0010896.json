Wall Street's major indexes gained on continued optimism among investors ahead of quarterly earnings reports. Meanwhile, U.S. crude climbed to three-year highs, boosted by OPEC-led production cuts and expectations that U.S. crude inventories have dropped for an eighth week. The local share price index futures rose 0.4 percent, or 23 points, to 6,111, a 24.8-point discount to the underlying S&P/ASX 200 index close. The benchmark rose 0.1 to close at a 10-year high on Tuesday. New Zealand's benchmark S&P/NZX 50 index was slightly higher in early trade.
