The 20-year yield dipped 1.0 basis point to 0.580 percent, while the 30-year yield dropped 1.0 basis point to 0.810 percent.\nJGBs gained as U.S. Treasuries bounced back after Trump’s dollar comments, which contradicted with remarks by Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin a day earlier.\nThe market showed no reaction to Japan’s inflation data, which showed consumer prices rose 0.9 percent in December as expected.
