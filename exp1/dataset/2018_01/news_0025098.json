The company manufactures in Thailand.\nPandora last week said it would target a core profit (EBITDA) margin of 35 percent in 2018-2022, down from 39.1 percent in 2016.\nWhile physical stores remain the main distribution channel, Pandora aims to lift online sales to between 10 and 15 percent of revenues by 2022 from 6 percent in 2017, Friis said.
