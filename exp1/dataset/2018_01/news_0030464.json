The bodies of two sailors were recovered from the ship while a third body was pulled from the sea near the vessel. The remaining 29 crew of the ship are presumed dead. \n(Infographic: Tanker blaze burns bright interactive - tmsnrt.rs/2DmrPvL ) \nIn a statement on Wednesday, the Chinese Ministry of Transport said the salvage team had located the wreck, which was at a depth of 115 metres (377 feet) under sea level, and were preparing to send underwater robots to explore it. \nThe SOA said vessels had taken 31 water samples in the area around the wreck containing black grease with heavy oil smells, and a concentration of petroleum that exceeds some seawater quality standard limits.

Strong winds pushed it away from the Chinese coast, where the incident happened, and into Japan’s exclusive economic zone. \nThe ship, which was carrying 136,000 tonnes or almost 1 million barrels of condensate - an ultra-light, highly flammable crude oil - sank after several explosions weakened the hull. \nOn Tuesday Japan’s environment ministry said it did not see much chance that the spill would reach its shores.
