He was shooting in our group.” \nThe attack at the school of nearly 1,150 students in a small farming town was the latest outbreak of gun violence that has become a regular occurrence at schools and college campuses across the United States over the past several years.

Sixteen of the injuries were from gunshot wounds. The remaining four teenagers suffered other sorts of injuries in the panic. \nHospital officials said they expected all those wounded to survive. \nTelevision actress Haley Strode, a Kentucky native, expressed shock. \n“Devastated to hear about the fatal school shooting in my home state. Heartbroken,” Strode said on Twitter. “Is nothing sacred any longer?” Reporting by Gina Cherelus in New York; Editing by Scott Malone and David Gregorio", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-24T16:50:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-24T17:09:41.005+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
