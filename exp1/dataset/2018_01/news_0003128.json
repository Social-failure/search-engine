On small- and mid-caps Boscher said he remained positive on cyclical themes.\nRemy Cointreau ( RCOP.PA ) was a rare laggard, down 2.9 percent after Investec downgraded the stock, saying Chinese anti-corruption measures could affect consumption of costly status symbol products like cognac.\n(Euro zone earnings pessimism fades - view the graphic reut.rs/2Cma4eS )\nReporting by Helen Reid, Editing by Kit Rees and Janet Lawrence\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-04T10:31:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-04T10:48:43.004+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
