However, analysts had expected a rise of between 2.4 and 3.2 percent.\nRivals Sainsbury’s ( SBRY.L ), Britain’s second largest supermarket group, and fourth-ranked Morrisons ( MRW.L ), both beat forecasts for Christmas trading.\nShares in Tesco fell 4 percent at the open, and were trading down 3.5 percent at 0915 GMT, the second worse performer after Marks & Spencer ( MKS.L ), which reported a fall in like-for-like Christmas sales on Thursday.\nTesco Chief Executive Dave Lewis said food, and particularly fresh food, were driving growth across all the company’s stores and online, with the company selling over 600,000 turkeys and half a million kilos of fresh salmon.\n“In the Christmas week itself (...) we sold more food than ever before at Tesco as we made our offer the most competitive it’s been for many, many years,” he told reporters.\nTesco, which Lewis has overhauled following a 2014 accounting scandal, said it remained confident in its outlook for the full year and was firmly on track to deliver its medium-term ambitions.\nFood sales grew by 3.4 percent, and fresh food specifically by 3.7 percent in the six weeks before Christmas, he said, but weaker sales in general merchandise were a 0.6 percent drag and the disruption in tobacco supplies took a 0.5 percent toll.\nLewis said the collapse of the Palmer & Harvey tobacco supplier had taken “the shine off an otherwise outstanding performance for the period as a whole”.\nBroker Bernstein said Tesco’s like-for-like food numbers were “very strong”, but its Christmas could disappoint due to tobacco and general merchandise.\nIt said that excluding the Palmer & Harvey impact would give Tesco Christmas like-for-like sales of 2.4 percent, better than Morrisons’ 2.1 percent and about 2.0 percent for Sainsbury‘s, excluding its Argos acquisition.\nThe group also reported data for the third quarter, with UK like-for-like sales up 2.3 percent, having increased 2.1 percent in the second quarter.\nEditing by Keith Weir\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-11T09:55:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-11T10:10:11.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
