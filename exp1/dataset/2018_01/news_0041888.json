The company reported sales of $13.26 billion in 2016.\nThe company also lowered its full-year 2017 core sales forecast, saying it would rise 0.8 percent compared with its previous forecast of a 1.5 percent to 2.0 percent rise.\nThe company blamed “retailer inventory rebalancing” in the United States and the bankruptcy of a leading baby retailer for the slower growth.\nIn November, the company reported dismal quarterly results due to a weak back-to-school season and the bankruptcy of its customer, Toys “R” Us, sending its shares down 25 percent.\nNewell also said it expects its normalized earnings per share to be between $2.72 and $2.76 in 2017, down from its previous outlook of between $2.80 and $2.85.\nAnalysts’ on average expect the company to post a profit of $2.81, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.\nNewell said it intends to start considering options for the businesses immediately and expects any resulting transactions to be completed by the end of 2019.\n“We believe that exiting non-strategic assets, reducing complexity and focusing on our key consumer-focused brands will make us more effective at unlocking value and responding to the fast-changing retail environment,” Newell Brands Chief Executive Michael Polk said.\nThese actions would significantly reduce global factory and warehouse footprint and customers and consolidate 80 percent of its global sales on two enterprise resource planning platforms by end 2019, the company said.\nThe company's shares lost a fifth of their value to trade at $24.69, their lowest in over four years.
