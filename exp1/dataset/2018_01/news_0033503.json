BIG TICKET MARKET \nWalsh had bought 31,250 Carpetright shares at 160 pence on Jan. 5. \nBut the shares tumbled as much as 48 percent in early trade on Friday and at 1115 GMT were down 43 percent at 92.5 pence, with the profit warning also felt across the retail sector. \nShares in DFS Furniture ( DFSD.L ) were down 3.7 percent, home improvement retailer Kingfisher ( KGF.L ) fell 3.8 percent, and electricals groups Dixons Carphone ( DC.L ) lost 2.5 percent. \nCarpetright, which trades from 416 UK stores and also sells beds, said like-for-like sales in its home market fell 3.6 percent in the 11 weeks to Jan. 13. \nIn the key post Christmas period like-for-like sales in the core flooring category slumped 7.1 percent. \n“Footfall is down, which is likely to have an impact on the wider big ticket market, most notably upholstery,” said Peel Hunt analysts, who cut their stock rating to “hold” from “buy”. \nTrading in Carpetright’s Rest of Europe division, comprising the Netherlands, Belgium and Ireland, was “volatile”, though it said like-for-like sales rose 4.3 percent over the 11 weeks. \nCarpetright cut its 2017-18 full-year underlying pretax profit guidance to 2-6 million pounds. Analysts’ consensus forecast had been for 14.1 million pounds, compared with the 14.4 million pounds delivered in 2016-17.
