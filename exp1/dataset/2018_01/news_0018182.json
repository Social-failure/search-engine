U.S. companies will be more competitive globally, which will ultimately benefit all Americans,” Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon said in a statement. \nNet profit, adjusted to exclude the tax charge and other one-time items, was $6.7 billion, or $1.76 per share, for the fourth quarter ended Dec. 31. ( bit.ly/2AR7AUe ) \nAnalysts had expected earnings of $1.69 per share on average, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. \nNet revenue rose 4.6 percent to $25.45 billion, beating the estimate of $25.15 billion. \nNet interest income rose 11 percent to $13.4 billion on higher interest rates and loan growth. Markets revenue, however, fell 22 percent to $4.43 billion. \nNet income, reported under generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) and including the tax charge, declined to $4.23 billion, or $1.07 per share, in the fourth quarter ended Dec. 31, from $6.73 billion, or $1.71 per share, a year earlier.
