He had been trying to help officials form a power-sharing government to avoid any return to violence between pro-British unionists and Irish nationalists that scarred the province for decades. \nHe will be replaced a May loyalist, Karen Bradley. \nThe Liberal Democrats’ Alistair Carmichael said the reshuffle could be summed up as “nothing has changed”, repeating words used by May at one of the lowest points in her election campaign when she was forced to change policy over social care. \n“Theresa May wanted to reassert her authority but has come out of this looking weaker than ever,” he said in a statement. \nAdditional reporting by Alistair Smout; Editing by Richard Balmforth\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-08T15:55:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-08T16:12:34.001+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
