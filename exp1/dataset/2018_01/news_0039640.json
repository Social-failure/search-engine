The Company also reported a one-time, non-cash deferred tax asset (DTA) charge of $930,000, or $0.10 per share, as a result of the new federal tax law passed in December 2017.\nHIGHLIGHTS\nCore net income increased 29% for the year to $5.6 million, or $0.60 per diluted share, from $4.3 million, or $0.54 per diluted share in 2016. Core return on average assets (ROAA) for the year equaled 1.05%, compared to 0.92% for 2016. Core return on average equity (ROAE) equaled 9.01%, compared to 8.53% for 2016. The efficiency ratio for 2017 equaled 62.2%, compared to 66.6% in 2016. Total noninterest bearing demand deposits equaled 49.8% of total deposits and total non-maturity deposits equaled 81.5% of total deposits.\nFollowing the passage of the new federal tax law in December the Company determined that a DTA impairment charge was required based on the reduction in the federal corporate tax rate from 34% to 21%. The Company expects to see its total tax burden reduced by approximately 28% in future periods, recouping the DTA charge in the next three quarters.\nChief Executive Officer Frank Mercardante said, “2017 was the strongest year for earnings in the Company’s history. Loan originations exceeded $136 million and core deposit growth remains robust. Given the strength of the economy and the Bank’s current position in the marketplace, we remain excited about the future.”\nNet income, including the DTA adjustment, totaled $4,664,000, or $0.50 per diluted share, for the year just ended. This represents a 26.3% increase over 2016 net income of $3,692,000, or $0.45 per diluted share. Excluding the DTA impairment charge, the 2017 after tax operating income increased 29.4% to $5,594,000, or $0.60 per diluted share, compared to $4,324,000, or $0.54 per diluted share in 2016, excluding non-core merger expenses.\nNet interest income, before loan loss provisions, increased 12% in 2017 to $22,673,000 from $20,255,000 in 2016. The net interest margin for 2017, exclusive of the impact of purchase accounting accretion and amortization, equaled 4.40%, compared to 4.56% for 2016. Net interest income was positively impacted during 2017 by purchase accounting accretion in the amount of $382,000, or 8 basis points, compared to $709,000, or 17 basis points for all of 2016.\nThe yield on average interest bearing assets, exclusive of the impact of purchase accounting accretion, equaled 4.71% for 2017, compared to 4.87% in 2016. The 16 basis point decline was primarily due to a higher volume of prepayment penalties earned on loans in 2016. The cost of interest bearing liabilities, exclusive of purchase accounting accretion, equaled 0.65% for all of 2017, compared with 0.59% in 2016.\nAverage interest earning assets in the current year equaled $505.8 million, while average interest bearing liabilities equaled $242.8 million. This compares to $428.6 million and $237.6 million in 2016, respectively. Total loans averaged $420.3 million in 2017, compared with $368.8 million in 2016. Total Deposits averaged $462.4 million in 2017, compared to $381.8 million in 2016. Total non-maturity deposits averaged $366.7 million in 2017, compare to $286.4 million in 2016.\nNoninterest income increased 6.3% in the year to $3,283,000 from $3,088,000 in 2016. Service charges and fee income were up 47.1% and SBA loan sales and fee income was up 8.1%, while other noninterest income was down 6.8%. The Company also recorded a loss on the sale of a Shared National Credit in the amount of $184,000 during the second quarter, which is reflected in other noninterest income.\nNoninterest expenses, including merger related charges, declined year-over-year by $477,000, or 3%, to $16,139,000 from $16,616,000 in 2016. Other noninterest expenses declined by 2% in all of 2017 compared to 2016. Occupancy and salaries and benefits increased by 12% and 6%, respectively.\nThe ROAA for the twelve months of 2017, exclusive of the DTA adjustment, was 1.05%, compared with 0.96% for 2016. The ROAE for the full 2017 year, exclusive of the DTA adjustment, totaled 9.01%, compared with 9.18% for 2016, excluding non-core merger costs.\nCredit quality remained strong throughout the year. The Company recorded a provision for loan losses of $300,000 in 2017, compared to $250,000 in 2016, largely due to growth in the portfolio. Excluding $144.1 million in loans carried under purchase accounting rules, which are held at a discount of 1.38% as of December 31, 2017, the allowance for loan and lease losses to total loans held for investment equaled 1.25% of loans outstanding. Total loans held for sale equaled $7.9 million at the end of the year.\nShareholders’ equity at the Company as of December 31, 2017, equaled $64.1 million, compared to $58.6 million at December 31, 2016. Both the Company and Bank remained “Well-Capitalized” by regulatory definition at December 31, 2017, with capital ratios as follows:\nMinimum\nRequired\nCompany\nBank\nTier 1 Leverage Ratio: 4.00% 10.11% 11.10% Common Equity Tier 1 Capital Ratio: 4.50% 11.85% 13.01% Tier 1 Capital Ratio: 6.00% 11.85% 13.01% Total Capital Ratio: 8.00% 12.70% 13.86% About Pacific Commerce Bancorp\nPacific Commerce Bancorp is the parent company for Pacific Commerce Bank.
