Qualcomm paid billions of U.S. dollars to a key customer, Apple, so that it would not buy from rival,” European Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager said in a statement. \n“This meant that no rival could effectively challenge Qualcomm in this market, no matter how good their products were. Qualcomm’s behaviour denied consumers and other companies more choice and innovation – and this in a sector with a huge demand and potential for innovative technologies,” she continued.
