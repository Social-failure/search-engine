Big industrial stocks with overseas exposure like Caterpillar , United Technologies , General Motors and the perpetually struggling General Electric would sell off, he said.\nStill, Cramer predicted that China would agree to these demands. Why, he wondered, would China sacrifice trade with the United States to produce low-quality metal that pollutes its already smoggy air?\nMoreover, shares of Nucor , a U.S.-based steel producer and a major proponent of Section 232 , have been climbing in the face of the company's weak earnings , suggesting that the move could be more imminent than many market-watchers expect, Cramer said.\n\"I want to steel you ... for the oncoming barrage of stories about how we're in a trade war with China ,\" the \"Mad Money\" host said. \"Breaking news: we've been in one for years. If Wilbur Ross does what I think he will do, the only difference will be that we'll actually finally be fighting back. So be ready; it will happen smack in the middle of earnings season and it definitely isn't baked into the stock market, but it could be your next big buying opportunity.\"\nWATCH: Cramer's take on US-China trade relations show chapters Cramer: The US-China 'trade war' could explode in 2018 20 Hours Ago | 04:46 Disclosure: Cramer's charitable trust owns shares of General Electric and Nucor.\nQuestions for Cramer?\nCall Cramer: 1-800-743-CNBC\nWant to take a deep dive into Cramer's world?
