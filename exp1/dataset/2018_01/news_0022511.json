It will already increase to 47 percent of GDP in 2021 from 37.5 percent, reflecting placements of international bonds and concession borrowing, according to latest IMF figures.\nDebt service would peak in 2019-2020 at about 6.5 percent of GDP with Eurobonds that will be due.\nThe government has said it will mitigate the impact on the poor by exempting sales taxes on basic food products and medicines.\nBut economists reckon subsidy cuts are bound to worsen the plight of poorer Jordanians, a majority of the country’s population, and removing subsidies has triggered civil unrest in the past.\nCritics say any hikes would extract more from the segment of salaried employees that already pays while leaving influential business tycoons outside the tax net.\nThe country’s economic growth has been hit in the last few years by high unemployment and regional conflict weighing on investor sentiment and as demand generated from Syrian refugee receded, according to the IMF.\nReal GDP was revised downwards to 2 percent in 2017 about one percent lower than anticipated at the start of the IMF program and was expected to hover around 3 percent, almost half the levels it attained a decade ago.\n$1=0.709 dinars\nReporting by Suleiman Al-Khalidi; editing by Diane Craft\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-01-16T07:14:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-16T03:14:44.010+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
