(NASDAQ:IBTX), the holding company for Independent Bank, today announced net income of $19.2 million, or $0.68 per diluted share, for the quarter ended December 31, 2017 compared to $14.8 million, or $0.79 per diluted share, for the quarter ended December 31, 2016 and $23.5 million, or $0.84 per diluted share, for the quarter ended September 30, 2017.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017, the Company reported net income of $76.5 million, or $2.97 per diluted share, compared to $53.5 million, or $2.88 per diluted share, for the year ended December 31, 2016.\nFourth quarter and year end 2017 net income and earnings per share were negatively impacted by a $5.5 million charge to remeasure deferred taxes as a result of the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. The effect on diluted earnings per share for fourth quarter and year end 2017 is $0.20 and $0.22, respectively.\nHighlights\nSolid earnings with increases across major income related metrics Adjusted (non-GAAP) net income was $25.3 million, or $0.90 per diluted share, compared to $24.8 million, or $0.89 per diluted share, for third quarter 2017 Adjusted (non-GAAP) return on average assets increased to 1.15%, from third quarter 2017 of 1.13% Improved adjusted (non-GAAP) efficiency ratio of 50.1%, compared to 51.2% for third quarter 2017 Organic loan growth of 11.6% for the quarter (annualized) and 12.2% since year end 2016 Announced acquisition of Integrity Bancshares, Inc. and its subsidiary, Integrity Bank, that is projected to be accretive to earnings per share with minimal dilution to tangible book value Completed a primary/secondary equity offering, raising $26.8 million (net of offering costs) and a $30 million subordinated debt offering, which enhanced the Company's capital position Sharpened footprint and focus on Colorado Front Range with the successful sale of nine Colorado branches transferring approximately $99 million in loans and $160 million in deposits\n“2017 was a productive year for our Company,” said Independent Bank Group Chairman and CEO David R. Brooks. “We reported another year of record earnings driven by solid organic loan growth and growth through the strategic Carlile acquisition, maintained excellent asset quality metrics, and continued our focus on improving overall efficiency. These operating results enhanced shareholder value in 2017, increasing tangible book value, and resulting in a solid adjusted return on tangible equity and the payment of a significant dividend.” Brooks continued, “We were pleased to announce the Integrity acquisition and the completion of the related equity and debt offerings which are important building blocks for the next steps in our Company’s continued growth. We believe that all of these accomplishments position us for a successful 2018.”\nFourth Quarter 2017 Operating Results\nNet Interest Income\nNet interest income was $75.3 million for fourth quarter 2017 compared to $46.5 million for fourth quarter 2016 and $72.9 million for third quarter 2017. The increase in net interest income from the previous year was due to increased average earning asset balances resulting primarily from the acquisition of Carlile, as well as organic growth for the year. The net increase from the linked quarter is primarily a result of increased acquired loan accretion and organic loan growth. The average balance of total interest-earning assets grew by $2.4 billion and totaled $7.5 billion at December 31, 2017 compared to $5.2 billion at December 31, 2016 and was unchanged compared to September 30, 2017 despite the sale of nine Colorado branches. The increase from prior year is due primarily to $1.8 billion in average earning assets acquired in the Carlile transaction as well as organic growth. The yield on interest-earning assets was 4.61% for fourth quarter 2017 compared to 4.16% for fourth quarter 2016 and 4.47% for third quarter 2017. The increase from the prior year is due primarily to loans and taxable securities acquired in the Carlile transaction, which had higher effective interest rates as well as higher interest rates on interest-bearing deposits which are tied to the Fed Funds rate. The increase from the linked quarter is primarily due to a higher loan yield which was the result of an increase of $1.6 million in acquired loan accretion, in addition to higher interest rates on nontaxable securities and interest-bearing deposits. The cost of interest bearing liabilities, including borrowings, was 0.89% for fourth quarter 2017 compared to 0.75% for fourth quarter 2016 and 0.84% for third quarter 2017. The increase from the prior year and linked quarter is primarily due to higher rates offered on public fund certificates of deposit and money market accounts due to competition in our markets but also due in part to increased interest rates on deposit products tied to Fed Funds rates and short-term FHLB advances. The net interest margin was 3.97% for fourth quarter 2017 compared to 3.59% for fourth quarter 2016 and 3.85% for third quarter 2017. The adjusted (non-GAAP) net interest margin, which excludes purchased loan accretion, was 3.84% for fourth quarter 2017 compared to 3.58% for fourth quarter 2016 and 3.80% for third quarter 2017. The increase in the net interest margin from the prior year is primarily due to the higher yielding asset mix acquired in the Carlile transaction and the three increases in the Fed Funds target rate since fourth quarter 2016. The increase from the linked quarter is primarily related to higher loan accretion income and improved yields in the investment portfolio.\nNoninterest Income\nTotal noninterest income increased $8.4 million compared to fourth quarter 2016 and $1.4 million compared to third quarter 2017. The increase from the prior year primarily reflects increases of $1.7 million in service charges, $1.7 million in mortgage income, $1.0 million in gain on sale of repossessed assets and $3.0 million in gain on sale of branches. The overall increase from prior year reflects the acquisition of Carlile. The gain on sale of branches was recognized upon the sale of nine Colorado branches during fourth quarter 2017. The increase from the linked quarter reflects an increase of $4.0 million in gains mentioned above offset by a decrease of $351 thousand in gain on sale of loans, $871 thousand in retail mortgage income and $1.4 million in other noninterest income. Mortgage warehouse purchase loan fee income of $266 thousand was included in mortgage income for the period ended September 30, 2017 and has been reclassified to other noninterest income. That compares to mortgage warehouse purchase fee income of $515 thousand for the fourth quarter 2017. The decrease in other noninterest income is due to $928 thousand less in acquired loan recoveries compared to third quarter 2017.\nNoninterest Expense\nTotal noninterest expense increased $22.2 million compared to fourth quarter 2016 and increased $1.6 million compared to third quarter 2017. The increase in noninterest expense compared to fourth quarter 2016 is due primarily to increases of $11.0 million in salaries and benefits, $1.7 million in occupancy expenses, $971 thousand in data processing, $3.9 million in acquisition-related expenses and $2.5 million in other noninterest expenses. The increase from prior year is reflective of additional headcount, branch locations and accounts acquired in the Carlile transaction, which closed on April 1, 2017. The increase includes acquisition expenses for professional and contract termination fees incurred relating to the acquisition, conversion expenses related to the integration of Carlile's core systems, and expenses resulting from restructuring the acquired branch system. The increase from the linked quarter is primarily related to an increase of $2.2 million in acquisition-related expenses offset by a decrease of $700 thousand in occupancy expense. The increase in acquisition expense is primarily related to the branch restructuring as well as severance and retention paid to former Carlile employees.\nProvision for Loan Losses\nProvision for loan loss was $1.9 million for the fourth quarter 2017, a decrease of $300 thousand compared to $2.2 million for the fourth quarter 2016 and consistent with $1.9 million for the third quarter 2017. Provision expense is primarily reflective of organic loan growth during the respective period. The decrease from prior year primarily reflects the improved credit quality of our energy portfolio. The allowance for loan losses was $39.4 million, or 0.62% of total loans, at December 31, 2017, compared to $31.6 million, or 0.69% of total loans at December 31, 2016, and compared to $37.8 million, or 0.61% of total loans, at September 30, 2017. The dollar increases from prior periods are primarily due to additional general reserves for organic loan growth. The decrease in the allowance for loan losses as a percentage of loans from prior year reflects that loans acquired in the Carlile transaction were recorded at fair value without an allowance at acquisition date.\nIncome Taxes\nFederal income tax expense of $18.2 million was recorded for the quarter ended December 31, 2017, an effective rate of 48.7% compared to tax expense of $7.4 million and an effective rate of 33.4% for the quarter ended December 31, 2016 and tax expense of $11.7 million and an effective rate of 33.2% for the quarter ended September 30, 2017. The higher tax rate in the fourth quarter 2017 was primarily due to the $5.5 million charge to remeasure deferred taxes resulting from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.\nFourth Quarter 2017 Balance Sheet Highlights:\nLoans\nTotal loans held for investment, net of mortgage warehouse purchase loans, were $6.3 billion at December 31, 2017 compared to $6.2 billion at September 30, 2017 and $4.6 billion at December 31, 2016. The $83.2 million change for the quarter represents organic growth of total loans held for investment of $182.1 million for the quarter, or 11.6% on an annualized basis and the disposal of $98.9 million in loans sold with the Colorado branches at the beginning of fourth quarter 2017. Loans held for investment grew $1.7 billion from December 31, 2016, or 38.0%, of which $1.4 billion was loans held for investment acquired in the Carlile acquisition and $557.4 million was organic growth, or 12.2%, for the year. Total mortgage warehouse purchase loans were $164.7 million at December 31, 2017 compared to $138.6 million at September 30, 2017, representing growth of $26.1 million, for the quarter, or 18.9%. Commercial real estate (CRE) loans were $3.4 billion at December 31, 2017 compared to $3.3 billion at September 30, 2017 and $2.5 billion at December 31, 2016, or 51.7%, 50.9% and 53.7% of total loans, respectively.\nAsset Quality\nTotal nonperforming assets decreased to $22.7 million, or 0.26% of total assets at December 31, 2017 from $25.0 million, or 0.28% of total assets at September 30, 2017, and increased from $19.8 million, or 0.34% of total assets at December 31, 2016. Total nonperforming loans increased to $15.4 million, or 0.24% of total loans at December 31, 2017 from $14.7 million, or 0.24% of total loans at September 30, 2017, and decreased from $17.8 million, or 0.39% of total loans at December 31, 2016. The net decrease in the dollar amount of nonperforming assets from the linked quarter is primarily due to $3.0 million of other real estate dispositions and a $1.3 million paydown on a residential real estate nonaccrual loan, offset by the addition of a $2.1 million nonaccrual commercial loan. The increase in the dollar amount of nonperforming assets from the prior year is primarily due to additions in other real estate owned totaling $11.2 million related to the Carlile acquisition as well as nonaccrual additions totaling $4.7 million during the year including the above mentioned loan placed on nonaccrual in fourth quarter 2017 offset by other real estate owned dispositions totaling $7.8 million as well as $5.8 million of nonaccrual payoffs during the year. The decrease in nonperforming loans from the prior year is primarily due to the aforementioned nonaccrual additions and payoffs during the year as well as the removal of a $1.0 million single-family interim construction loan from nonaccrual status due to repossession of collateral. Charge-offs were 0.02% annualized in the fourth quarter 2017 compared to less than 0.01% annualized in the linked quarter and 0.02% annualized in the prior year quarter.\nDeposits and Borrowings\nTotal deposits were $6.6 billion at December 31, 2017 compared to $6.9 billion at September 30, 2017 and compared to $4.6 billion at December 31, 2016. The increase from the prior year is primarily due to $1.8 billion in deposit accounts acquired in the Carlile transaction in addition to organic growth. The decrease in deposits from the linked quarter is primarily related to the sale of Colorado branches during fourth quarter 2017 as well as run off in public fund deposits. Total borrowings (other than junior subordinated debentures) were $667.6 million at December 31, 2017, a decrease of $16 million from September 30, 2017 and an increase of $100 million from December 31, 2016. The change in the linked quarter reflects a reclassification of $15 million in repurchase agreements to deposits during the quarter in addition to normal paydowns of FHLB advances, offset by the issuance of $29.3 million, net of issuance costs, of 5.0% fixed and floating rate subordinated debentures issued in fourth quarter 2017. The change in the prior year is due to the aforementioned issuance of subordinated debentures and the use of short term FHLB advances as needed for liquidity.\nCapital\nIn November 2017, the Company completed a primary/secondary equity offering, raising approximately $26.8 million, net of offering costs, in new equity capital and facilitating the sale of a significant number of shares of Company common stock by private equity firms with large holdings, as well as a subordinated debt offering, raising approximately $29.3 million, net of offering costs, in new Tier 2 capital. The additional capital had a positive effect on capital ratios, including an increase in our tangible common equity to tangible assets ratio (non-GAAP) to 8.37% as of December 31, 2017, up from 7.62% at September 30, 2017 and 7.17% at December 31, 2016. Book value and tangible value per common share (non-GAAP) also increased to $47.28 and $23.76, respectively, at December 31, 2017 compared to $35.63 and $21.19, respectively, at December 31, 2016 due to the retention of earnings, the additional capital from the Carlile acquisition in second quarter and the issuance of common stock in fourth quarter. Independent Bank Group is well capitalized under regulatory guidelines. At December 31, 2017, our estimated common equity Tier 1 to risk-weighted assets, Tier 1 capital to average assets, Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets and total capital to risk-weighted asset ratios were 9.61%, 8.90%, 10.04% and 12.55%, respectively.\nSubsequent Events\nThe Company is required, under generally accepted accounting principles, to evaluate subsequent events through the filing of its consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2017 on Form 10-K.

Any forward-looking statement made by the Company in this release speaks only as of the date on which it is made. Factors or events that could cause the Company’s actual results to differ may emerge from time to time, and it is not possible for the Company to predict all of them. The Company undertakes no obligation to publicly update any forward-looking statement, whether as a result of new information, future developments or otherwise, except as may be required by law.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nIn addition to results presented in accordance with GAAP, this press release contains certain non-GAAP financial measures. These measures and ratios include “adjusted net income”, \"adjusted earnings\", “tangible book value”, “tangible book value per common share”, “adjusted efficiency ratio”, “tangible common equity to tangible assets”, “adjusted net interest margin”, \"return on tangible equity,\" “adjusted return on average assets” and “adjusted return on average equity” and are supplemental measures that are not required by, or are not presented in accordance with, accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. We consider the use of select non-GAAP financial measures and ratios to be useful for financial operational decision making and useful in evaluating period-to-period comparisons. We believe that these non-GAAP financial measures provide meaningful supplemental information regarding our performance by excluding certain expenditures or assets that we believe are not indicative of our primary business operating results. We believe that management and investors benefit from referring to these non- GAAP financial measures in assessing our performance and when planning, forecasting, analyzing and comparing past, present and future periods.\nWe believe that these measures provide useful information to management and investors that is supplementary to our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows computed in accordance with GAAP; however we acknowledge that our financial measures have a number of limitations relative to GAAP financial measures. Certain non-GAAP financial measures exclude items of income, expenditures, expenses, assets, or liabilities, including provisions for loan losses and the effect of goodwill, core deposit intangibles and income from accretion on acquired loans arising from purchase accounting adjustments, that we believe cause certain aspects of our results of operations or financial condition to be not indicative of our primary operating results. All of these items significantly impact our financial statements. Additionally, the items that we exclude in our adjustments are not necessarily consistent with the items that our peers may exclude from their results of operations and key financial measures and therefore may limit the comparability of similarly named financial measures and ratios. We compensate for these limitations by providing the equivalent GAAP measures whenever we present the non-GAAP financial measures and by including a reconciliation of the impact of the components adjusted for in the non- GAAP financial measure so that both measures and the individual components may be considered when analyzing our performance.\nA reconciliation of our non-GAAP financial measures to the comparable GAAP financial measures is included at the end of the financial statements tables.\nContacts:\nAnalysts/Investors:\nMichelle Hickox\nExecutive Vice President and Chief
