That was up 17.3 percent on the previous year.\nIn contrast, public sector vacancies fell back 7.6 percent in the November quarter to 18,300.\nAnalysts value the vacancies series as it has proved a reliable leading indicator of labor demand and turning points in employment growth.\nThe strength in vacancies supports official figures for employment which showed a surge in hiring last year, driving the jobless rate down to 5.4 percent.\nReporting by Wayne Cole; Editing by Sam Holmes\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-01-10T09:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-10T03:05:11.001+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
