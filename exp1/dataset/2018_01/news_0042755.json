And the rise in transaction fees helped convince Stripe that bitcoin is meant to be more of an asset and less of a currency for daily payments.\n\"By the time the transaction is confirmed, fluctuations in bitcoin price mean that it's for the 'wrong' amount,\" Stripe's Tom Karlo said . \"For a regular bitcoin transaction, a fee of tens of U.S. dollars is common, making bitcoin transactions about as expensive as bank wires.\"\nMore from Recode:\nA lobbying group for Amazon, Facebook and Google is kicking off a new diversity initiative thanks to pressure from Congress Why people are buying more expensive smartphones than they have in years Facebook bought a startup that specializes in verifying government IDs So the company said it doesn't make sense to keep allowing merchants to accept a payment method that no one wants to use. The last bitcoin transactions will be processed on April 23.\nStripe says it remains bullish on the crypto-economy, and CEO Patrick Collison was certainly ahead of the curve on bitcoin's rise. Collison told Recode back in 2014 that it was important for the payments platform to accept a currency that anyone around the world could access.\n\"Universality is the big one for me,\" he said. \"Bitcoin is something that anyone can get ahold of.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-24T11:32:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-24T12:12:44.016+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
