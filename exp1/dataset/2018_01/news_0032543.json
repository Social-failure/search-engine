Her frustration could have cost her a default when she swiped a ball dangerously close to a line judge when serving at 5-6 in the opening set.\nInstead she received only a warning from the match umpire.\nMuguruza refused to blame the heat, which soared to 39 degrees Celsius, the blister, or a strapped right thigh for her earliest loss in Melbourne since a second-round thrashing by Serena Williams five years ago.\n“She’s definitely a very tricky opponent,” she said. “I think today she played well. I maybe could have done things better, but at the end, she deserves to win. That’s really it.”\nIt was an honest appraisal.\nTennis - Australian Open - Rod Laver Arena, Melbourne, Australia, January 18, 2018.

REUTERS/Thomas Peter Apart from when she recovered from 5-2 in the first set and a brief rally at the end of the second, she was inferior against the former world doubles number one whose box of tricks featured several shots not found in any tennis textbook.\nHsieh, who wobbled briefly when 5-2 ahead in the second set, was especially productive on the backhand side, guiding 12 winners past her opponent, the last one coming on match point.\n“Today I tried to hit the ball a little bit harder because I didn’t want to let destroy me on the court,” Hsieh, who will face a player very much in her mould in Poland’s 26th seed Agnieszka Radwanska on Saturday, told reporters.\nSlideshow (3 Images) ”I do a lot of different training. I practise topspin, flat balls, slice. I try to practice all the stuff. So against different players, I try to do a little bit different stuff.\n“Not try to play the same game. It helps a lot.”\nMuguruza will rue the first set tiebreak that she allowed to get away from her all too easily, having dug deep to claw herself back into the set.\nShe served a double-fault at 1-4 and then was left standing by a backhand jab down the line as Hsieh moved 6-1 ahead before Muguruza wafted a forehand over the line to concede the set.\nMuguruza unraveled in the second set and looked cooked at 2-5 before some late Hsieh nerves gave her a glimmer of hope.\nHsieh held it together when she served at 5-4, however, as Muguruza joined fellow seeds Venus Williams, Sloane Stephens, Coco Vandeweghe, Kristina Mladenovic and Johanna Konta through the exit door.\nEditing by Peter Rutherford\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-18T06:34:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-18T06:50:05.001+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
