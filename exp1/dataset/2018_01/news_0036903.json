The federal prosecutors office could not immediately be reached for comment.\nBrothers Joesley and Wesley were arrested in September accused of insider trading, after an investigation found that they had used information from their own plea deals to profit with foreign exchange and share transactions.\nRepresentatives for J&F and prosecutors have held informal talks to discuss the terms of a possible renegotiation of the plea deal. The company would have to pay additional amounts to the 10.3 billion reais leniency fine agreed in May, the source added.
