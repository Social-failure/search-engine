Recent purchases include CT scanner and ultrasound equipment maker Toshiba Medical Systems and Swedish video surveillance firm AXIS. \nCanon, which has a market value of some $52 billion, is also benefiting from robust demand for organic light emitting diode (OLED) screens in smartphones, with its OLED panel-making equipment unit flooded with new orders. \nAdditionally, strong demand for memory chips used in data centers and smartphones is expected to boost sales of its semiconductor lithography equipment. \nExpectations of a profit jump come despite Canon assuming a stronger yen for this year. It expects the Japanese currency to average 110 against the U.S. dollar, a rise of around 2 yen. \n($1 = 108.7200 yen)", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-30T11:55:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-30T12:11:07.005+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
