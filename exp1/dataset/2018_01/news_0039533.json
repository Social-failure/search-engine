In Lloyds’ case, the Berlin outpost is set to remain small. It currently employs about 300 staff and that is expected to rise by just a handful. \nReuters reported last February that Lloyds, Britain’s largest mortgage lender, was examining steps to turn its branch in the German capital into a subsidiary. It is the only major British retail lender without a subsidiary in another EU country. \nFrankfurt has been the preferred base for U.S. banks preparing for EU trading after Brexit, with Morgan Stanley, Citi and JPMorgan so far choosing the city which hosts the European Central Bank. \nFor Lloyds, Berlin’s appeal is that it already has the bank’s main European branch with a full management team in place, including the finance, risk and human resources staff. \nThe bank is still expecting to transfer only a handful of jobs to the new subsidiary, the person said.
