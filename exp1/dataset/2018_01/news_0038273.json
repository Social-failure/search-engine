REUTERS/Satish Kumar \nFleetwood excelled in difficult conditions, carding six birdies over the closing nine holes and drew praise from McIlroy, who simply said: “That was obscene.” \n”I’ve never come to a tournament as defending champion,“ Fleetwood, who celebrated his 27th birthday on Friday, said. ”It’s a strange feeling because you feel quite possessive over your trophy and you don’t really want to give it back. \n“So that’s always been in the back of my mind this week. Luckily enough, I was playing well and I had a chance to win, and the back nine was a very special nine holes. It’s a very, very nice feeling.” \nFisher led for much of the final round before carding 69 while McIlroy, playing in his first event since October, closed with a round of 70. \n“My game is in really good shape and I saw some really, really positive signs,” McIlroy, who has slipped to 11th in the rankings, said. “So I‘m looking forward to next week in Dubai and obviously looking forward to the rest of the season.” Reporting by Shrivathsa Sridhar in Bengaluru; Editing by Toby Davis", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-21T17:44:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-21T18:13:04.001+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
