Desperate to recover his stock, Fikri jumped inside and was killed by a rubbish crusher.\nIn July the king pardoned dozens of people arrested in the protests and blamed local officials for failing to quickly implement development projects which stoked public anger.\nReporting by Zakia Abdennebi; Writing by Ulf Laessing\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-23T00:59:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-23T01:04:23.025+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
