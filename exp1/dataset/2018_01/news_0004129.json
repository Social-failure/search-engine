They have also chanted slogans in support of political prisoners.\n“Resolving the problems is not easy and would take time. The government and people should help each other to resolve the issues,” Rouhani said, according to IRNA.\nRouhani also rebuffed U.S. President Donald Trump’s comments in support of the protests.\n“This man in America who is sympathizing today with our people has forgotten that he called the Iranian nation terrorists a few months ago. This man who is against the Iranian nation to his core has no right to sympathize with Iranians,” Rouhani said.\nReporting by Bozorgmehr Sharafedin, Editing by William Maclean\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-01-01T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-01T03:54:30.027+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
