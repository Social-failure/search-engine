According to national law, the case has to start from scratch after the ruling. \nNiki’s newly appointed Austrian administrator Ulla Reisch said she would cooperate with her German counterpart and aimed to find a solution for the carrier within three weeks. \n“We will not start from the beginning as if there had never been proceedings in this case,” Reisch told Reuters, adding that she will consider the IAG deal but was also open for new deals if they were better. \n“I think a solution can be found within two to three weeks,” Reisch said. \nGerman administrator Lucas Floether, however, said he was considering legal action against the neighbouring country’s court decision, having already agreed the deal with IAG. \n“The opening of this case contradicts European insolvency regulation,” he said in a statement. \nIAG, which had committed to pay the January salaries for Niki staff, said it was monitoring the situation. \nNiki owes 153 million euros to around 200 creditors, according to Austria’s creditors body KSV 1870. \nFairplane, which said it has claims of 1.2 million euros against Niki for 3,000 passengers, welcomed the Austrian court’s decision. \n“This is an important decision to minimize damage at Niki and to safeguard passengers rights,” Fairplane said in a statement.
