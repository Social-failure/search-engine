In a statement, Airbus did not mention the status of a parallel Austrian investigation into the same arms deal.\nIn a separate case, Airbus said that it had been ordered to pay 104 million euros ($126.82 million) after arbitration over alleged breach of contract in the sale of missiles to Taiwan by one of its subsidiaries in 1992.\nA major sale of French arms to Taiwan in that year triggered a series of corruption cases and led to arbitration awards against other French companies.\n$1 = 0.8201 euros Reporting by Tim Hepher; Editing by Richard Lough\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-01-14T00:19:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-14T20:28:11.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
