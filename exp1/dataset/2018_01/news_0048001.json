The 13 have been banned from going to sports events.\nAnne Frank was born in Germany but her family fled to the Netherlands to escape the Nazi takeover. They lived in hidden rooms in Amsterdam before they were discovered by German occupiers and deported to concentration camps.\nShe died in the Bergen-Belsen camp aged 15 and her diary recounting the family’s time in hiding became a centerpiece of Holocaust literature.\nThe tribunal said Lazio did everything in its power to prevent discriminatory material being introduced in the stadium, noting the stickers were too small to be detected.\nHowever, Lazio was still held “objectively” responsible for the incident as the supporters’ representative, the Italian FA said on Thursday (www.figc.it).\nThe tribunal opted not to ask Lazio to play two matches behind closed doors as the Italian FA prosecutor requested, as this would also punish fans who did not play a part in what happened.
