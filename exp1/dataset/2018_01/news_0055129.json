In equities, the bourse trades so-called “B-shares”, which are denominated in the U.S. dollar.\nThe aircraft leasing firm said the ABS, whose amount totals $171.33 million, is structured in eight tranches with the longest product maturity period of 7.65 years. All tranches are rated AAA by China Cheng Xin International.\nCALC said the ABS holds significance in attracting U.S. dollar investment in China and in reducing outflows of the currency.\nThe dollar ABS should also help limit foreign currency risks, as aircraft purchases are denominated in dollars.\nThe ABS is managed by Huatai Securities Asset Management Co.
