The tables are expected to be published this month. Rep. Richard Neal (D-MA) speaks as the House-Senate Conferees hold an open conference meeting on the \"Tax Cuts and Jobs Act\" on Capitol Hill in Washington, U.S., December 13, 2017. REUTERS/Joshua Roberts \nTrump insists that workers will see higher pay and new jobs from his sweeping overhaul of the U.S. tax system and White House analysts say the average household can expect a $4,000 pay raise. \nDemocrats claim the Republican tax changes are little more than a giveaway for corporations and the wealthy. \nThe impact of the new tax law is expected to be a major campaign issue this year, as Republicans battle Democrats for control of the House and Senate in the November election. \nRepresentative Kevin Brady, Republican chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee and a main author of the Republican tax overhaul, dismissed the concerns expressed by Wyden and Neal. \n“There’s never been any question about the IRS’s timely, accurate withholding tables. Nor should there be today,” Brady told reporters. \n“The bottom line here is Democrats so object to Americans keeping more of what they earn at work, they’ll do and say just about anything to cast doubt on it,” he added.
