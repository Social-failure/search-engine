Analysts polled by Reuters had predicted the same rise for December.\nInflation for 2017 as a whole was also 0.4 percent, as prices in the full year rose for the first time since 2013. Prices fell 0.2 percent in 2016.\nPrices began falling in Israel in September 2014 and kept doing so for 28 months in a row before turning positive in January for five months, hitting 0.9 percent in March.\nCompared with November, consumer prices ILCPI=ECI rose 0.1 percent in December.\nExpectations that inflation would stay below the government’s 1-3 percent target in the near term drove the Bank of Israel to cut benchmark interest rates in early 2015 to 0.1 percent from 0.25 percent.\nThe bank has since held the rate steady and projects a rate of 1.1 percent in 2018. It expects a strong shekel and a strong economy.\nThe bank’s next rate decision is scheduled for Feb. 26.\nBank of Israel economists believe the benchmark interest rate will remain at 0.1 percent for most of this year, rising in the fourth quarter to end 2018 at 0.25 percent.\nCentral bank chief Karnit Flug has said rates likely will not rise until inflation is back to within its target range.\nReporting by Steven Scheer; editing by John Stonestreet\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-01-16T00:59:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-16T13:33:14.012+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
