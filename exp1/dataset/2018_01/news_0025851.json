Base metals slipped on Tuesday with copper and nickel hitting multi-week lows as a steadier dollar weighed, while oil fell as Brent crude oil shed some of its recent gains. The local share price index futures fell 0.5 percent, or 31 points, to 5961, an 87.6-point discount to the underlying S&P/ASX 200 index close. The benchmark closed down 0.5 percent on Tuesday. New Zealand's benchmark S&P/NZX 50 index rose 0.3 percent in early trade.
