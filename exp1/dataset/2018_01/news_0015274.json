One protestor was killed in Tebourba, a town 40 km (25 miles) west of Tunis. \nKhelifa Chibani, a spokesman for the interior ministry, said 44 people had been arrested for carrying weapons such as knives, setting government buildings on fire and looting shops. \nPM Chahed told reporters that while demonstrations were acceptable, violence was not. \n“People have to understand that the situation is extraordinary and their country is have difficulties but we believe that 2018 will be the last difficult year for the Tunisians,” Chahed said.
