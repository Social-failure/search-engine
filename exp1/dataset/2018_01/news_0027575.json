REUTERS/Bernadett Szabo “I have come as I totally agree that the system of public education is in a bad state,” added Flora Kokendi, 21, a university student. \nCritics of Prime Minister Viktor Orban’s right-wing government say it has failed to reform big state-run systems such as education and healthcare, which are also suffering from a big brain-drain of smart young Hungarians to western Europe. \n\nSlideshow (3 Images) “A just, democratic and modern education for all students,” said one leaflet prepared by the protest organisers which demanded a free choice of textbooks, a bigger student say in educational matters and a reduction in mandatory school hours. \nOrban’s Fidesz party, in power since 2010, is expected to win a third term in a row in an election set for April 8. \nOrban has used his time in office to rewrite hundreds of laws, the constitution and to centralise power. His reforms, such as those affecting the judiciary and the media, have triggered conflicts with the European Union. \nReporting by Krisztina Than; Editing by Gareth Jones\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-20T00:07:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-19T19:25:25.009+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
