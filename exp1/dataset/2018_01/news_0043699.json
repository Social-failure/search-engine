Once that decision is made, they will seek further backing for the litigation from other British lawmakers, Brake told Reuters. \nBrexit will break a 4-decade trading relationship with the EU and has divided British politics across party lines. Supporters argue that after 2016’s referendum vote to leave, any attempt to halt the process would be anti-democratic. \nBut opponents say the country should have a right to pass final judgement on any exit deal negotiated, and the Scottish litigation is the latest attempt to try to make this happen. \nPrime Minister Theresa May formally notified the EU of Britain’s intention to leave by triggering Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty on March 29 last year, starting a two-year exit process. \nArticle 50 does not specify whether exit can be unilaterally reversed although former British diplomat Lord Kerr, who drafted it, has said Britain can change its mind at any stage before the final exit date in 2019. \nMay has said she will not tolerate any attempt in parliament to block Brexit. But British lawmakers defied the government in December by voting against May’s wishes and securing parliament a much more substantial say on whether to accept the final deal with the EU. \nThe Court of Session is expected to refer the matter to the European Court of Justice, the EU’s highest court, to conclusively rule on the issue.
