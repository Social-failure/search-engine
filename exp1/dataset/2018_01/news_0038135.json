But we believe new impulses are urgently needed in order to reach our goal of staying up,” Chief Executive Heribert Bruchhagen said in a statement. \nGisdol had taken over in September 2016. His team narrowly avoided relegation last season but failed to turn things around this season with only two wins in their last 17 league games. \nThe club said a decision on Gisdol’s replacement would be taken very soon.
