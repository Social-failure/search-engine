They were followed by fintechs with 541 million euros in 2017. \n* The bulk of investments in startups in Germany was made in Berlin. Berlin-based firms in 2017 raised nearly 3 billion euros - almost three times as much as in 2016 - in 233 rounds of financing. \n* The two biggest single transactions were done by Delivery Hero , which received 387 million euros from Napster in May and then raised 423 million in its stock market flotation in June. \n* EYâ€™s study includes German companies founded no more than 10 years ago.
