This was TCS’ third straight dip in quarterly net profit. \nAnalysts had, on average, expected TCS to post a profit of 65.18 billion rupees, according to Thomson Reuters data. \n“We’re very optimistic about a faster and stronger turnaround in insurance,” Chief Executive Rajesh Gopinathan told reporters in Mumbai, adding that banking segment recovery was a little more unpredictable. \nTCS is the first of India’s listed software services exporters to report earnings for October-December and its numbers set the tone for the results season for the $154 billion outsourcing industry. \nIts income from operations rose about four percent to 309.04 billion rupees. \nTCS, part of salt-to-software conglomerate Tata group, said revenue growth from all segments was above 9.5 percent, barring retail and BFSI. \nWeakness in the BFSI segment “indicates continued impact of change in sourcing strategy of a few important clients,” local brokerage Kotak Securities said in a client note after results. \nThe results come as Indian outsourcers are anticipating major challenges from visa restrictions on movement of personnel to the United States, their biggest market, under President Donald Trump’s administration. \nChief Financial Officer V Ramakrishnan said the company was not immediately concerned by work visa issues in U.S. as it had been preparing internally for any changes to the visa regime. \nThe Mumbai-headquartered company won its first 50 million plus deal for digital services. \nGopinathan said TCS was winning “meaningful large deals”, adding that he remained positive the momentum would continue.
