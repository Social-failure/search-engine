German retailer Metro reported flat sales for the Christmas quarter.\nAlso on the agenda we’ve got Rio Tinto giving an update on Q4 sales and Renault’s full year sales.\nOn the subject of autos, the sector is going to be in focus as the North American International Auto Show in Detroit gets under way, where carmakers will be unveiling new and redesigned concept vehicles.\nOne stock under scrutiny will be Carillion, which has just said that the company is to enter into compulsory liquidation with immediate effect as discussions were not successful.\n(Kit Rees)", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-15T15:01:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-15T09:40:54.005+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
