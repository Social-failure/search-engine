United was offering to waive fees for changes to flights to and from Boston, New York, Philadelphia and other affected airports for scheduled Tuesday and Wednesday flights.\nThe storm itself is relatively minor compared to other winter weather events, and several hundred flights represent only a tiny percentage of airlines’ overall operations. But such storms are still a nuisance to carriers and can cost them millions of dollars in lost revenue.\nA massive winter storm at the onset of the year caused thousands of cancellations, as several inches of snow and ice paralyzed the U.S. Northeast and forced the closure of some of the region’s biggest airports.\nReporting by Alana Wise, Editing by Rosalba O'Brien\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-17T01:51:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-17T01:59:18.027+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
