A Chinese central bank official said authorities should ban centralised trading of virtual currencies as well as individuals and businesses that provide related services. \nSeveral companies have issued clarifications on their roles in blockchain technology. Shanghai U9 Game said its core business does not involve blockchain technology. \nEarlier this week, Sichuan Shuangma Cement, Shenzhen Kaifa Technology and a few others made similar announcements.
