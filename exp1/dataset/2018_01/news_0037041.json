Trump wants it strengthened with a separate agreement within 120 days.\nMany private economists think Iran can prevent any uncontrolled slide of its currency. Its official foreign reserves were estimated by the International Monetary Fund at over $130 billion early last year, and since then rising oil prices have probably increased them.\nBut the rial’s volatility in the last few weeks has underlined the tough task which the central bank faces as it manages the currency.\n“They have to consider many factors - inflation, the wishes of lower-income Iranians, the wishes of the business community, and the geopolitics,” said one Iranian banker. “It is not a simple process.” (Reporting by Bozorgmehr Sharafedin and Andrew Torchia Editing by Jeremy Gaunt)\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-01-22T22:37:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-23T18:16:16.019+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
