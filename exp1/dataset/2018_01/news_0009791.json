The SEC said it was alarmed about “the accuracy and adequacy of information” relating to the compensation paid for promotion of its and statements in SEC filings about the plans of Crypto’s insiders to sell their stock.\nThe Briscoe Law Firm, PLLC is a full service business litigation, commercial transaction, and public advocacy firm with more than 20 years of experience in complex litigation and transactional matters.\nView source version on businesswire.com : http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180109006288/en/\nThe Briscoe Law Firm, PLLC\nWillie Briscoe, 888-809-2750\nshareholders@thebriscoelawfirm.com\nSource: The Briscoe Law Firm, PLLC", "external_links": ["http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180109006288/en/", "http://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.thebriscoelawfirm.com&esheet=51740394&newsitemid=20180109006288&lan=en-US&anchor=The+Briscoe+Law+Firm%2C+PLLC&index=3&md5=85131b819ed17f28d17e830487b8d629", "http://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.thebriscoelawfirm.com&esheet=51740394&newsitemid=20180109006288&lan=en-US&anchor=The+Briscoe+Law+Firm%2C+PLLC&index=2&md5=80c48443fd573a463bcb8704c46b6e7e", "http://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.thebriscoelawfirm.com&esheet=51740394&newsitemid=20180109006288&lan=en-US&anchor=Willie+Briscoe&index=1&md5=c8ef4b2b530079b701bc2bb797ef6494"], "published": "2018-01-09T18:53:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-09T21:28:49.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
