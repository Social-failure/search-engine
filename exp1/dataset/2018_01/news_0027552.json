Tahoe Resources said it was terminating 250 employees from the mine, given its inability to resume operations pending the court’s final decision. \nThe Supreme Court issued the suspension after an anti-mining organization appealed to the court alleging that the country’s Ministry of Energy and Mines had not consulted with the Xinca indigenous people before awarding the license to Tahoe’s Guatemalan unit, Minera San Rafael. \nThe mine employed more than 1,000 people before the license suspension, Tahoe Resources said. If the court decides to reinstate the license in the next several weeks, the need for future job cuts could be eliminated, the company said.
