None of the wounded were in critical condition, he said, adding that additional medical personnel were sent to the area. \nOn Saturday, Turkey launched an offensive against the Kurdish YPG militia, which it views as a security threat, in Syria’s Afrin, opening a new front in the multi-sided Syrian civil war and further straining ties with its NATO ally Washington. \nDozens of combatants and more than two dozen civilians have been killed so far in the offensive, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a Britain-based war monitor, has said. \nThe Turkish military said in a statement on Friday it had killed at least 343 militants in northern Syria since the operation started. \nThe Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) however, a YPG-dominated umbrella group backed by the United States in the fight against Islamic State, has previously said that Turkey was exaggerating the number of the dead.
