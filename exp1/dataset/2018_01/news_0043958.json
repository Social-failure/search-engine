The regulation knocked off about 8.20 billion rupees ($129 million) from Idea’s revenue in the third quarter.\nIdea posted a 12.85 billion rupees loss for the quarter to December, its fifth consecutive quarterly loss in the ultra-competitive Indian telecoms market.\nThat missed the average 12.80 billion rupees estimate from 11 analysts, according to Thomson Reuters data.\nIts revenue from operations fell about 25 percent to 65.10 billion rupees. ( bit.ly/2n5AACI )\nIdea raised its guidance for capital expenditure to 70 billion rupees for the current financial year, from a previous view of 60 billion rupees, and said it was on track to launch voice over LTE services from March 2018 onwards.\nLast week, bigger telecoms player Bharti Airtel posted a lower-than-expected quarterly profit as the drop in interconnection fees, which are set to be abolished entirely from 2020, chipped away at its earnings.\nIdea, India’s third-biggest telecoms carrier by revenue and subscribers, said its merger with Vodafone Group Plc’s Indian unit was expected to be completed in the first half of this calendar year.\nThe merger will potentially create India’s biggest telecom player in a market that has been disrupted by cut-price offerings from Reliance Industries’ telecom arm Jio.\nIdea shares were trading down 5 percent after results were announced, versus the wider market that was steady.\n$1 = 63.6850 Indian rupees Reporting by Tanvi Mehta in Bengaluru; Editing by Himani Sarkar\n ", "external_links": ["http://bit.ly/2n5AACI", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-01-24T16:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-25T13:08:18.010+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
