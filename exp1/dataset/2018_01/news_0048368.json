U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures fell 56 cents, or nearly 1 percent, to $65.58 a barrel.\nBrent has risen 6.3 percent so far this month, headed for its biggest January rise since 2013.\nWeighing on WTI prices, analysts expected U.S. crude supplies would post a weekly rise for the first time in 10 weeks, a preliminary Reuters poll showed on Monday. Industry group American Petroleum Institute posts its data on Tuesday and the U.S. Energy Information Administration reports on Wednesday.\n\"Drawdowns in Cushing, Oklahoma have really been a lever point for trade in recent weeks and months. That will be watched very closely,\" said Anthony Headrick, energy market analyst at CHS Hedging LLC in St. Paul, Minnesota.\nOil prices have been buoyed by the U.S. dollar's six straight weekly slides. The greenback is set to fall 3 percent this month. Oil is priced in the U.S. currency, so a falling dollar can boost demand for crude from buyers using other currencies.\nThe dollar index had been below $90 since Jan. 24. But the currency has rebounded nearly 0.5 percent since Friday to $89.59, which has weighed on crude prices.\n\"After six weeks of losses balance is inevitable. Its influence has really resurged as of late to where the dollar index below $90 has propped up oil,\" said John Kilduff, partner at Again Capital LLC in New York.\nCrude prices also had drawn support from a large premium in the front-month Brent oil contract over those for future delivery, as investment in crude futures and options reached a new record high last week.\nOil consumption is surging as a result of growth in major economies, while OPEC and its allies have made repeated commitments to limiting their crude output.\nOn Monday, Iraq's oil minister said in London that the oil market was improving, and that the country would comply with OPEC output cuts even though it is trying to increase its oil export capacity.\nSomewhat offsetting the OPEC-led cuts has been rising oil output in North America.\n\"We believe that todays oil prices project a too rosy picture,\" said Julius Baer's head of macro and commodity research Norbert Ruecker.\nU.S. output <C-OUT-T-EIA> has jumped more than 17 percent since mid-2016. It is expected to exceed 10 million bpd soon.\nU.S. production is now on par with top exporter and OPEC kingpin Saudi Arabia. Only Russia produces more.\n(Additional reporting by Nina Chestney and Amanda Cooper in London and Henning Gloystein in Singapore; Editing by David Gregorio)", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-29T20:49:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-29T22:42:29.014+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
