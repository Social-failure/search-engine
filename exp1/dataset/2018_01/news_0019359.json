The plane, Bombardier Dash Q400, had been flying from Krakow to Warsaw.\nThere were 59 passengers and four crew members on board.\nState news agency PAP said that the plane crew was signalling a chassis failure. During the landing manoeuvre it was forced to close down its front wheels, PAP also said.\nThe last time Warsaw airport witnessed an emergency landing on the aircraft’s belly was in 2011, when LOT’s Boeing 767-300ER flying from Newark was unable to extend its wheels. There were no casualties.\nReporting by Pawel Sobczak and Marcin Goclowski, Editing by William Maclean and Diane Craft\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-01-11T03:36:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-11T03:43:09.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
