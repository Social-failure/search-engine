(NYSE:BERY) (“Berry”) announced today that its direct, wholly-owned subsidiary Berry Global, Inc.

(“Clopay” and such acquisition, the “Clopay Acquisition”) and to pay related fees and expenses. The consummation of the Clopay Acquisition is not a condition to the closing of the offering. If the Clopay Acquisition is not completed, Berry intends to use the net proceeds of the offering to repay debt under its senior secured credit facilities and for general corporate purposes.\nThe Notes are being offered only to persons reasonably believed to be qualified institutional buyers in reliance on Rule 144A under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”), and outside the United States, only to non-U.S. investors pursuant to Regulation S. The Notes have not been and will not be registered under the Securities Act or any state securities laws and may not be offered or sold in the United States absent an effective registration statement or an applicable exemption from registration requirements or a transaction not subject to the registration requirements of the Securities Act or any state securities laws.\nThis press release shall not constitute an offer to sell or the solicitation of an offer to buy any security and shall not constitute an offer, solicitation or sale in any jurisdiction in which such offering, solicitation or sale would be unlawful.
