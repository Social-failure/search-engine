I got a second chance and I‘m going to try to take it and see how far I can go.”\nWozniacki will meet Slovakian 19th seed Magdalena Rybarikova for a place in the quarter-finals.\nEditing by Toby Davis\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-19T15:58:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-19T16:14:28.002+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
