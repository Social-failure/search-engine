Wolff did not explain what that word meant.\nJohnson replied: “I think Her Majesty the Queen is well capable of taking this American president, or indeed any American president, in her stride, as she has done over six remarkable decades. She has seen them come, and she has seen them go.”\nDuring the Queen’s 65-year reign there have been 13 U.S. Presidents, starting with Harry S. Truman. No date has been set for a Trump visit.\nReporting by William James; editing by Stephen Addison\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-01-09T20:50:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-09T14:57:07.013+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
