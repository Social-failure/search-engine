Fourth-quarter gross domestic product increased at a 2.6 percent annual rate, a report showed.\nThe U.S. dollar remained weak against a basket of major currencies, still bruised by comments earlier this week by a senior U.S. official in support of a weak dollar and following Friday’s U.S. growth data.\nPresident Donald Trump’s comments Thursday in favor of a “strong dollar,” a day after Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said a weaker greenback would help U.S. trade balances in the short term, failed to put a lid on volatility and keep dollar bears in check.\nThe dollar index .DXY, which measures the greenback against a basket of six major currencies, was down 0.44 percent at 89.002, and on track for its worst weekly performance since May.\n“The dollar move has attracted a lot of attention for the right reasons; it’s a pretty important driver right now for other assets,” said Peter Cecchini, managing director and chief market strategist at Cantor Fitzgerald in New York.\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJI rose 77.92 points, or 0.3 percent, to 26,470.71, the S&P 500 .SPX gained 13.42 points, or 0.47 percent, to 2,852.67 and the Nasdaq Composite .IXIC added 42.01 points, or 0.57 percent, to 7,453.17.\nThe pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index .FTEU3 rose 0.54 percent and MSCI's gauge of stocks across the globe .MIWD PUS gained 0.29 percent.\nA 10th week of gains for the MSCI world index would be its longest winning streak since 1999.\nIn a weekly note on capital flows, Bank of America Merrill Lynch analysts said that 98 percent of global equity markets are now trading above 50 and 200-day moving averages, though the pace of the melt-up meant a correction was now increasingly likely.\nWorld equity markets have rallied over the past year, buoyed by a synchronized uptick in global economic growth in a boon to corporate profits and stock valuations. But some reckon other factors may be spurring the rally.\nU.S. Treasury yields trimmed early gains after the GDP data.\nBenchmark 10-year notes US10YT=RR last fell 14/32 in price to yield 2.6711 percent, from 2.621 percent late on Thursday.\nIn the energy market, U.S. crude CLcv1 rose 0.89 percent to $66.09 per barrel and Brent LCOcv1 was last at $70.47, up 0.07 percent on the day.\nAdditional reporting by Ritvik Carvalho and Marc Jones in London, Sruthi Shankar in Bengaluru and Saqib Iqbal Ahmed in New York; Editing by Bernadette Baum\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-26T02:34:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-26T02:47:01.002+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
