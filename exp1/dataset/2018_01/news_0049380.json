Both are subsidiaries of Wanda Group. \nWanda Hotel will also use around HK$4.1 billion of the proceeds to repay loans and interest due to Wanda HK, it added. \nShares of Wanda Hotel will resume trading on Tuesday. They have been suspended since Jan. 19. \nThe sales are expected to lessen financial strains of Dalian Wanda Group, caused by a major acquisition spree, by helping Wanda HK to meet upcoming debt deadlines. \nChina’s regulators last year told banks to stop providing funding for several of Wanda’s overseas acquisitions, sources have said, part of a crackdown on what Beijing sees as irrational spending by some domestic conglomerates. Since then, Wanda, whose businesses range from real estate to football and cinemas, has embarked on a string of asset sales.
