We won’t give an inch,” Yoan Karar, a senior Force Ouvriere (FO) union official, told CNews. \nHis union is demanding higher wages and rapid hiring of 2,400 staff. \nMacron’s pressure is under mounting pressure to resolve the unrest among prison staff after several attacks on guards by inmates in different jails in the past week.

REUTERS/Emmanuel Foudrot \nPresident Emmanuel Macron said earlier this month that a plan would be presented in February that it would go beyond an existing pledge to build thousands of new prison cells. \nFrance’s prison population has more than doubled since the 1970s, and prison guards complain increasingly that they have neither the staff nor the equipment and support to deal with violent inmates, notably convicted Islamists and petty criminals who become radicalised while in prison. \nUnion representative Karar, a guard for 13 years at Fresnes prison on the edge of Paris, said records put the number of attacks on security staff at 4,000 a year. \n“You cannot put a guard in charge of 100 or 150 prisoners and just give him a whistle,” said Karar, calling for guards to be armed with taser guns.
