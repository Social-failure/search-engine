Marco Rubio (L) Scott R. Galvin/AP Republican Treasurer Josh Mandel has dropped out of the Senate race in Ohio after concerns arose about his wife's health. Mandel had hoped to challenge Democrat Sherrod Brown, who is the ranking Democrat on the Senate Banking Committee. Mandel previously ran against Brown in 2012. \nWASHINGTON (Reuters) - Ohio’s Republican Treasurer Josh Mandel has ended his bid to unseat the state’s Democratic U.S. senator, Sherrod Brown, citing his wife’s health, Mandel said in a news release posted on the Cincinnati Enquirer website. \n“We recently learned that my wife has a health issue that will require my time, attention and presence. In other words, I need to be there,” he said in the release. \nReuters was unable to immediately verify the report and a spokeswoman for the Mandel campaign was not immediately available for comment. \nBrown, the most senior Democrat on the Senate Banking Committee, was facing a tough challenge from Mandel after the traditional swing state went to Republican President Donald Trump in the 2016 national election. \nMandel unsuccessfully challenged Brown in 2012.
