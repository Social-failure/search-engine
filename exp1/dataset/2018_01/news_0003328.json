The footage could not be independently confirmed.\nJets also pounded Harasta, on the western edge of the enclave, where rebels this week besieged and overran a major military base which residents say the army uses to pound residential areas.\nThe rebel assault aimed partly to relieve the pressure of the tightening siege.\nThe United Nations says about 400,000 civilians besieged in the area face “complete catastrophe” because aid deliveries by the government are blocked and hundreds of people who need urgent medical evacuation have not been allowed outside the enclave.\nScores of hospitals and civil defence centres in Ghouta and across Syria have been bombed during the conflict in what the opposition said is a “scorched earth policy” to paralyze life in rebel-held areas.\nSyrian state news agency SANA said on Thursday rebel shelling of the government-held capital Damascus killed one and injured 22 in the Amara district of the city.\nIDLIB PUSH Supported by Iran-backed militias and intensive Russian bombing, the Syrian army has since last month waged a new campaign to push into the heart of another rebel-held part of Syria, Idlib province in the country’s northwest.\nIdlib is a heavily populated area where over two million people live.\nRescue workers said there had been a spike in civilian casualties there in the last twenty days from stepped-up aerial strikes on residential areas, documenting 50 dead at least in that period.\n“There have been at least six major massacres perpetrated by Russia in indiscriminate bombing of cities and towns with thousands fleeing their homes in the last two weeks,” said Mustafa al Haj Yousef, the head of Idlib’s Civil Defence, rescuers who work in opposition-held areas.\nOn Wednesday air strikes hit a maternity hospital in Idlib’s Ma‘arat al-Nu‘man city, killing five people, the Syrian American Medical Society (SAMS) charity, which supports the hospital, said.\nThe hospital, which SAMS said delivers around 30 babies a day, had been struck three times in four days and the last strikes temporarily put the hospital out of service.\nOvernight, a family of seven was buried under rubble in Tel Dukan village, rescuers said.\nThe army has been gaining ground in Idlib and the adjoining eastern Hama countryside, with scores of villages seized from rebels mainly belonging to Tahrir al Sham, a coalition of jihadist groups with mainstream Free Syrian Army (FSA) factions also engaged in the battles.\nReporting by Suleiman Al-Khalidi; Additional reporting by Lisa Barrington in Beirut; Editing by Nick Macfie and John Stonestreet\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-04T08:56:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-04T09:19:46.043+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
