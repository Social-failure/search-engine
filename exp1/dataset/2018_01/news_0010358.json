Fees are 3,050 pounds ($4,072) per term for mornings and 1,800 pounds for afternoons. \nCharlotte is fourth-in-line to the British throne behind her father, her elder brother George and grandfather Prince Charles and her parents are expecting a third baby in April. \nUnlike previous senior royals, Prince William attended nursery school as a child and son George made the step up from nursery to primary school in September when he began at Thomas’s Battersea, a private school in southwest London.
