The pay disclosures, which it had resisted, highlighted a broader debate about gender inequality. \nDirector-General Tony Hall pledged to close the gender pay gap by 2020, but the organisation has been criticised by its own journalists and by lawmakers for not acting fast enough. \nIts China editor Carrie Gracie, who was paid significantly less than her male counterparts, resigned her role last month to fight against what she called the “secretive and illegal BBC pay culture”. \nNorth America editor Sopel, one of the four who had agreed to a salary cut, earned between 200,000 pounds and 249,999 pounds in 2016/17, the disclosures showed. \nGracie said she was paid 135,000 pounds a year as China editor. \nThe highest paid of the four was Jeremy Vine, who earned between 700,000 pounds and 749,999 pounds for radio and TV work. Today radio programme presenter Humphrys earned between 600,000 pounds and 649,999 pounds, while news anchor Edwards was paid between 550,000 pounds and 599,999 pounds. \nThe BBC said the level of the cuts was not yet known. \nTony Hall and Carrie Gracie will be questioned by a committee of lawmakers on Wednesday about BBC pay.
