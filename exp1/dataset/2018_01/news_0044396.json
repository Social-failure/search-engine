Some are in jail, others are in exile or banned from politics. \nThe coalition had planned to hold primaries to settle on a joint candidate. But Thursday’s ruling said the coalition violated the principle of avoiding “double affiliation” in politics and therefore could not be validated.

REUTERS/Marco Bello \nCritics of Maduro slammed the accusation as baseless and said the decision was another demonstration of an electoral process riddled with wrongdoing. \n“The constitutional chamber’s decision shows that these are judges rented out for the government’s electoral strategy,” said Omar Barboza, the new president of the opposition-led congress. \nIt was not immediately clear what the coalition’s next moves would be. Opposition parties will have to decide whether to submit individually to the pre-election validation process, which is scheduled to take place this coming weekend. \nMembers of Venezuela’s government and opposition leaders are due to meet for another round of talks in the Dominican Republic on Jan. 28 and 29, the Dominican government said on Thursday.
