The monthly ECB meeting and comments from U.S. officials in Davos will be under intense scrutiny. There is enough corporate news to animate the market outside of macroeconomic issues - in tech we had trading updates for SAP and STMicro. Investors are continuously assessing whether the sector is too expensive given its hefty multiples. Germany's Siemens said it is preparing for an eventual consolidation of platforms competing to provide businesses with factory software, which might trigger some speculative M&A positioning. Swedish banking group Nordea raised its dividend marginally more than expected for 2017 even though profits for the fourth quarter fell short of analyst expectations. Northern European banks with their strong capital ratios have been investors’ sweethearts for a while but with confidence rising for southern lenders, it’s interesting to see whether a change of heart could progressively occur. In the realm of “special sits”, activist White Tale is selling its nearly 25 percent stake in speciality chemicals group Clariant to Saudi Basic Industries. Merger arbs, which are already quite busy looking into the bids for the likes of Ablynx, GKN, or Sky, will also focus on Cineworld's attempt to buy U.S. rival Regal Entertainment, dealt a blow after advisory group Institutional Shareholder Services told investors to oppose the $3.6 billion deal.

(0715 GMT) On the theme of if/when we see a market pullback, economists at Oxford Economics say that short-term risks are broadly balanced between a downward correction and a further 'melt-up' rally, according to their analysis. But a continued 'melt-up' could risk an equity correction of \"well over 10%\". Oxford Economics reckons a stock market correction of 25 percent could cut U.S. growth to around 1 percent by 2019.
