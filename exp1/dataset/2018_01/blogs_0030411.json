But the wisdom applies to cars as well.\n1946 Kurtis-Offy Midget CNBC 1946 Kurtis-Offy Midget With its two-speed transmission, Offenhauser racing engine and wheels ready for dirt or asphalt, Osborne calls the Midget the \"fundamental racer.\" It originally went for $7,000.\nIts heyday was known as a time \"when the sex was safe and the driving dangerous,\" Osborne says. It was not uncommon for drivers to veer off the race tracks and flip the car, which did not have a protective roll bar, and end up with a neck injury. \n1962 Chevrolet Biscayne CNBC 1962 Chevrolet Biscayne Drivers call this Chevy, which was popularized by the eponymous Beach Boys hit, \"the 409\" on account of its 409 cubic-inch size and 409 horsepower engine.\nAt an MSRP of $2,800, this was originally purchased by a 17-year-old drag racer Butch Leal, who took out its turn signals, radio and other interior elements to optimize its performance on the track.\nIt still has its original, raggedy interior, but don't let that fool you. This car has appreciated a lot.\n1972 Gurney Olsonite Eagle 1972 Gurney Olsonite Eagle Named after an \"absolute legend,\" Indy 500 racer Dan Gurney, these turbo-powered cars have engines with anywhere from 600 to 1000 horsepower.\nThis one originally sold for $35,000 and is now worth $1.5 million. According to Osborne, if it had actually won the Indy 500, it would be worth about five times that.\nAs for how much it and the others have appreciated in just the past five years, watch the video to find out.\nDon't miss: How a car that runs on steam doubled in value over the past 5 years \nCNBC's \" Jay Leno's Garage \" airs Thursdays at 10 p.m. EDT. \nVideo by Richard Washington \nShows \nWatch full episodes | TV schedule", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-17T17:31:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-17T17:46:23.002+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
