It is time for the Congress to give these wonderful Americans the 'right to try.'\"\nTrump also said: \"One of my greatest priorities is to reduce the price of prescription drugs. In many other countries, these drugs cost far less than what we pay in the United States.\"\n\"And it is very, very unfair,\" he said. \"That is why I have directed my administration to make fixing the injustice of high drug prices one of our top priorities. Prices will come down.\"\nIn the audience for the speech was former drug company executive Alex Azar, who on Monday was sworn in as Trump's secretary of Health and Human Services. When introducing Azar at that ceremony, Trump several times mentioned his desire that prescription drug prices be reduced.\nHowever, Trump's critics have scoffed at the idea of a former drug company executive leading the charge to cut medication costs.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-31T04:59:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-31T04:59:11.016+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
