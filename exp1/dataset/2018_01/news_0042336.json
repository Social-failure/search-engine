Sequential growth of 12%, primarily on account of contribution from new products major being sevelamer carbonate Year-on-year decline of 3%, primarily on account of higher price erosions due to channel consolidation and increased competition in some of our key molecules, and impact of adverse foreign exchange. The above is partly offset by new products contribution. As of 31 st December 2017, cumulatively 102 generic filings are pending for approval with the USFDA (99 ANDAs and 3 NDAs under 505(b)(2) route). Of these 99 ANDAs, 59 are Para IVs out of which we believe 29 have ‘First to File’ status. Revenues from Emerging Markets at Rs. 5.9 billion. Revenues from Russia at Rs. 3.4 billion. Year-on-year growth of 9%. In constant currency i.e. in Rouble terms year-on-year growth is 5%. Revenues from other CIS countries and Romania market at Rs. 1.0 billion. Year-on-year decline of 2%. Revenues from Rest of World (RoW) territories at Rs. 1.5 billion. Year-on-year decline of 17%. Revenues from India at Rs. 6.1 billion. Year-on-year growth of 3%. Normalizing for the GST transition related adjustments, the comparable growth is ~11%. Revenues from Europe at Rs. 2.0 billion. Year-on-year decline of 7%, primarily on account of higher price erosion in some of the key molecules coupled with temporary supply disruptions.\nPharmaceutical Services and Active Ingredients (PSAI)\nRevenues from PSAI at Rs. 5.4 billion. Year-on-year growth of 1%. During the quarter, 13 DMFs were filed globally of which 1 was in the US. The cumulative number of DMF filings as of 31 st December, 2017 was 791.\nProprietary Products (PP)\nRevenues from PP at Rs. 2.1 billion.\nDuring Q3 FY18 USFDA approved IMPOYZ™ (clobetasol propionate) Cream 0.025%. In line with the existing out licensing agreement with Encore Dermatology Inc. this approval triggered milestone recognition of Rs. 1.3 billion during Q3 FY18.\nIncome Statement Highlights:\nGross profit margin at 56.3%. Improved by ~300 bps sequentially, aided by better product mix and milestone receipt of Rs. 1.3 billion in Proprietary Products. Declined by ~280 bps over that of previous year primarily on account of higher price erosions, increased competitive intensity in some of our key molecules in the US and adverse foreign exchange impact. Gross profit margin for GG and PSAI business segments are at 59.5% and 23.8% respectively. SG&A expenses at Rs. 12.0 billion, an increase of 6%. During the quarter, a settlement agreement was entered into with the US Department of Justice on the litigation involving packaging against a payout of Rs. 319 million. The balance increase is on account of sales & marketing and other spends towards events specific to the quarter. Research & development expenses at Rs. 4.7 billion, a decrease of 6%. As % to Revenues- Q3 FY18: 12.3% | Q2 FY 18: 11.8% | Q3 FY17: 13.4%. Focus continues on building complex generics, biosimilars and differentiated products pipeline. Net Finance income at Rs. 851 million compared to Rs. 44 million in Q3 FY17. The incremental income of Rs. 807 million is on account of: Increase in profit on sales of investments by Rs. 698 million.
