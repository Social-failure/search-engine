Depletions, or distributor shipments to retail customers, rose 9.1 percent due to the Labor Day and Thanksgiving holidays in the quarter.\nNet income rose to $491.1 million, or $2.44 per share, in the third quarter ended Nov. 30, from $405.9 million, or $1.98 per share, a year earlier.\nExcluding one-time items the company earned $2.00 per share, beating analysts' average estimate of $1.89 per share.\nNet sales fell marginally to $1.80 billion from $1.81 billion but missed analysts' estimates of $1.87 billion.
