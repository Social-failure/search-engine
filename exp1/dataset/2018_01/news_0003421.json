While Evercore analysts estimated 5,800 deliveries, Cowen analysts expected just 2,250.\nTesla said 860 Model 3 vehicles were in transit to customers at the end of the fourth quarter.\nTesla said it delivered a total of 29,870 vehicles in the fourth quarter, including 15,200 Model S vehicles and 13,120 Model X cars.\nAnalysts had expected total deliveries of about 30,000.\n\"In the last seven working days of the quarter, we made 793 Model 3s, and in the last few days, we hit a production rate on each of our manufacturing lines that extrapolates to over 1,000 Model 3s per week,\" Tesla said in a statement.\nThe Model 3 starts at $35,000 or about half the price of its flagship Model S and over 500,000 customers have put down a refundable deposit for the car.
