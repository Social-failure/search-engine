Dutch central bank president Klaas Knot said on Sunday that \"there is no reason whatsoever\" for the European Central Bank (ECB) to continue its asset purchase program, suggesting years of policy stimulus may be coming to an end sooner than expected. His remarks added to a growing perception that strong global growth could force policymakers to tighten policy faster in coming months, potentially draining funds away from emerging markets. Some economists expect the Federal Reserve to raise its economic assessment when it concludes its two-day meeting on Wednesday, which would increase the probability that the U.S. central bank raises interest rates four times this year. The U.S. government's key payrolls report, scheduled for Friday, could also shed further light on the outlook for monetary policy. Currencies from Chile, Colombia, Mexico and Brazil weakened between 0.26 percent and 0.81 percent, capping a January rally in which all of them posted hefty gains. Stock markets were mixed, with Brazil's benchmark Bovespa stock index down 1 percent as traders booked profit on recent gains that drove it to all-time highs. Shares of wood pulp producer Fibria Celulose SA, however, jumped more than 5 percent on a report that Netherlands-based Paper Excellence was considering acquiring it. In Colombia, the central bank unexpectedly lowered the lending rate on Monday, the last cut in its current cycle, as policymakers try to boost a still-sluggish economy even as inflation remains above target. The seven-member board voted four-to-three to reduce the lending rate by 25 basis points to 4.50 percent, surprising the majority of analysts in a Reuters poll last week, who expected a hold.
