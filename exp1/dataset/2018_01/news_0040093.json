President Nana Akufo-Addo, who was the main opposition leader at the time of the transfer, criticized the government for accepting the two Yemenis at the time.\nNow his government is coming under pressure itself.\n“The government is constrained from immediately deporting them except to explore mutually acceptable means with other countries and the refugees,” Foreign Minister Shirley Ayorkor Botchwey told Reuters. “If we don’t get them to consent we cannot send them packing.”\nMahmud Umar Muhammad Bin Atef and Khalid Muhammad Salih al-Dhuby have lived in the capital, Accra, since they arrived. Neither man was tried or convicted at Guantanamo, nor have they been accused of any crime since arriving in Ghana.\nReporting by Kwasi Kpodo; Editing by Tim Cocks and Alison Williams\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-24T19:02:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-24T19:18:13.004+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
