U.S. President Donald Trump’s administration wants the threshold raised to 85 percent and it wants half the content made in the United States. \nEconomy Minister Ildefonso Guajardo said that while Mexico’s automotive industry, represented by AMIA, has expressed the desire to keep the current 62.5 percent regional requirement for autos, ”I have talked with them. I think we have to be realistic. \n“I believe that North America can rethink the model ... And I think it’s logical. Let’s be totally honest.” \nEduardo Solis, head of Mexico’s main auto industry group AMIA, has advocated for not touching the rules of origin, saying that he needed to ensure that North America’s auto industry remained competitive. \nAt the latest round of NAFTA talks in Montreal that concluded on Monday, Trump’s trade chief rejected a Canadian compromise plan to include expenses for engineering, research and development and other high-value work to be counted in higher targets for North American content with the aim of safeguarding high-paying jobs in the region. Mexico called it “innovative.” \nGuajardo said the plan “deserves a deeper analysis to try to rescue from it all that is technically valuable.” He added that it was predictable that U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer would deem the proposal unacceptable. \nFlavio Volpe, president ‎of the Toronto-based Automotive Parts Manufacturers’ Association, suggested on Monday that Lighthizer’s tough rhetoric was a negotiating tactic.
