Including the impact from the Tax Act, net income was $15.0 million.\nCurrent quarter diluted earnings per share of $0.44, an increase of 7 percent from the prior year fourth quarter diluted earnings per share of $0.41, excluding the impact of the Tax Act.

The Company believes that providing these non-GAAP financial measures provides investors with information useful in understanding the Company's financial performance, performance trends, and financial position. While the Company uses these non-GAAP measures in its analysis of the Company's performance, this information should not be considered an alternative to measurements required by GAAP.\nThe following table provides a reconciliation of certain GAAP financial measures to non-GAAP financial measures. The reconciling item between the GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures was the current quarter one-time net tax expense of $19.7 million. The one-time net tax expense was driven by the Tax Act and the change in the current year federal marginal rate of 35 percent to 21 percent for future years, which resulted in this revaluation of its deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities (“net deferred tax asset”). The Company believes that the financial results are more comparable excluding the impact of the revaluation of the net deferred tax asset.\nThree Months ended Year ended (Dollars in thousands, except per share data) Dec 31,\n2017 Sep 30,\n2017 Jun 30,\n2017 Mar 31,\n2017 Dec 31,\n2016 Dec 31,\n2017 Dec 31,\n2016 Net income (GAAP) $ 14,956 36,479 33,687 31,255 31,041 116,377 121,131 Tax Act adjustment (GAAP) 19,699 — — — — 19,699 — Net income (non-GAAP) $ 34,655 36,479 33,687 31,255 31,041 136,076 121,131 Basic earnings per share (GAAP) $ 0.19 0.47 0.43 0.41 0.41 1.50 1.59 Tax Act adjustment (GAAP) 0.25 — — — — 0.25 — Basic earnings per share (non-GAAP) $ 0.44 0.47 0.43 0.41 0.41 1.75 1.59 Diluted earnings per share (GAAP) $ 0.19 0.47 0.43 0.41 0.41 1.50 1.59 Tax Act adjustment (GAAP) 0.25 — — — — 0.25 — Diluted earnings per share (non-GAAP) $ 0.44 0.47 0.43 0.41 0.41 1.75 1.59 Return on average assets\n(annualized) (GAAP) 0.61 % 1.46 % 1.39 % 1.35 % 1.33 % 1.20 % 1.32 % Tax Act adjustment (GAAP) 0.81 % — % — % — % — % 0.21 % — % Return on average assets\n(annualized) (non-GAAP) 1.42 % 1.46 % 1.39 % 1.35 % 1.33 % 1.41 % 1.32 % Return on average equity\n(annualized) (GAAP) 4.91 % 11.87 % 11.37 % 11.19 % 10.82 % 9.80 % 10.79 % Tax Act adjustment (GAAP) 6.47 % — % — % — % — % 1.66 % — % Return on average equity\n(annualized) (non-GAAP) 11.38 % 11.87 % 11.37 % 11.19 % 10.82 % 11.46 % 10.79 % Dividend payout ratio\n(annualized) (GAAP) 110.53 % 108.51 % 48.84 % 51.22 % 121.95 % 76.00 % 69.18 % Tax Act adjustment (GAAP) (62.80 )% — % — % — % — % (10.86 )% — % Dividend payout ratio\n(annualized) (non-GAAP) 47.73 % 108.51 % 48.84 % 51.22 % 121.95 % 65.14 % 69.18 % Effective tax rate (GAAP) 67.69 % 24.19 % 26.11 % 23.79 % 23.74 % 35.70 % 24.67 % Tax Act adjustment (GAAP) (42.57 )% — % — % — % — % (10.88 )% — % Effective tax rate (non-GAAP) 25.12 % 24.19 % 26.11 % 23.79 % 23.74 % 24.82 % 24.67 % Financial Highlights\nAt or for the Three Months ended At or for the Year ended (Dollars in thousands, except per share and market data) Dec 31,\n2017 Sep 30,\n2017 Jun 30,\n2017 Mar 31,\n2017 Dec 31,\n2016 Dec 31,\n2017 Dec 31,\n2016 Operating results Net income 1 $ 34,655 36,479 33,687 31,255 31,041 136,076 121,131 Basic earnings per share 1 $ 0.44 0.47 0.43 0.41 0.41 1.75 1.59 Diluted earnings per share 1 $ 0.44 0.47 0.43 0.41 0.41 1.75 1.59 Dividends declared per share 2 $ 0.21 0.51 0.21 0.21 0.50 1.14 1.10 Market value per share Closing $ 39.39 37.76 36.61 33.93 36.23 39.39 36.23 High $ 40.31 37.76 36.72 38.03 37.66 40.31 37.66 Low $ 36.01 31.50 32.06 32.47 27.50 31.50 22.19 Selected ratios and other data Number of common stock shares\noutstanding 78,006,956 78,006,956 78,001,890 76,619,952 76,525,402 78,006,956 76,525,402 Average outstanding shares - basic 78,006,956 78,004,450 77,546,236 76,572,116 76,525,402 77,537,664 76,278,463 Average outstanding shares - diluted 78,094,494 78,065,942 77,592,325 76,633,283 76,615,272 77,607,605 76,341,836 Return on average assets (annualized) 1 1.42% 1.46% 1.39% 1.35% 1.33% 1.41% 1.32% Return on average equity (annualized) 1 11.38% 11.87% 11.37% 11.19% 10.82% 11.46% 10.79% Efficiency ratio 54.02% 53.44% 52.89% 55.57% 55.08% 53.94% 55.88% Dividend payout ratio 1,2 47.73% 108.51% 48.84% 51.22% 121.95% 65.14% 69.18% Loan to deposit ratio 87.29% 84.43% 81.86% 78.91% 78.10% 87.29% 78.10% Number of full time equivalent\nemployees 2,278 2,250 2,265 2,224 2,222 2,278 2,222 Number of locations 145 145 145 142 142 145 142 Number of ATMs 200 200 199 195 200 200 200\n1 Excludes a one-time revaluation of the deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities as a result of the Tax Act for the three months and year ended December 31, 2017.

The Company accomplished this strategy in part by redeploying investment cash flow selectively and selling securities into the higher yielding loan portfolio. The Durbin Amendment, which was passed as part of Dodd-Frank, establishes limits on the amount of interchange fees that can be charged to merchants for debit card processing and will reduce the Company’s service charge fee income in the future.\nTotal investment securities of $2.427 billion at December 31, 2017 decreased $115 million, or 5 percent, during the current quarter and decreased $675 million, or 22 percent, from the prior year fourth quarter.

The loan category with the largest increase was commercial real estate loans which increased $73.2 million, or 2 percent. Excluding the Foothills acquisition, the loan portfolio increased $601 million, or 11 percent, since the prior year end and primarily came from growth in commercial real estate and other commercial loans of $357 million and $209 million, respectively.\nCredit Quality Summary\nAt or for the\nYear ended At or for the\nNine Months\nended At or for the\nYear ended (Dollars in thousands) Dec 31,\n2017 Sep 30,\n2017 Dec 31,\n2016 Allowance for loan and lease losses Balance at beginning of period $ 129,572 129,572 129,697 Provision for loan losses 10,824 7,938 2,333 Charge-offs (19,331 ) (14,801 ) (11,496 ) Recoveries 8,503 6,867 9,038 Balance at end of period $ 129,568 129,576 129,572 Other real estate owned $ 14,269 14,359 20,954 Accruing loans 90 days or more past due 6,077 3,944 1,099 Non-accrual loans 44,833 46,770 49,332 Total non-performing assets $ 65,179 65,073 71,385 Non-performing assets as a percentage of subsidiary assets 0.68 % 0.67 % 0.76 % Allowance for loan and lease losses as a percentage of non-performing loans 255 % 256 % 257 % Allowance for loan and lease losses as a percentage of total loans 1.97 % 1.99 % 2.28 % Net charge-offs as a percentage of total loans 0.17 % 0.12 % 0.04 % Accruing loans 30-89 days past due $ 37,687 29,115 25,617 Accruing troubled debt restructurings $ 38,491 31,093 52,077 Non-accrual troubled debt restructurings $ 23,709 22,134 21,693 U.S. government guarantees included in non-performing assets $ 2,513 1,913 1,746 Non-performing assets at December 31, 2017 were $65.1 million, a decrease of $6.2 million, or 9 percent, from a year ago.

The increases were the result of strategically managing the deposit accounts to stay below $10 billion and utilizing FHLB advances to manage the daily liquidity needs for loan growth.\nStockholders’ Equity Summary\n$ Change from (Dollars in thousands, except per share data) Dec 31,\n2017 Sep 30,\n2017 Dec 31,\n2016 Sep 30,\n2017 Dec 31,\n2016 Common equity $ 1,201,036 1,201,534 1,124,251 (498 ) 76,785 Accumulated other comprehensive (loss) income (1,979 ) 4,667 (7,382 ) (6,646 ) 5,403 Total stockholders’ equity 1,199,057 1,206,201 1,116,869 (7,144 ) 82,188 Goodwill and core deposit intangible, net (191,995 ) (192,609 ) (159,400 ) 614 (32,595 ) Tangible stockholders’ equity $ 1,007,062 1,013,592 957,469 (6,530 ) 49,593 Stockholders’ equity to total assets 12.35 % 12.31 % 11.82 % Tangible stockholders’ equity to total tangible assets 10.58 % 10.55 % 10.31 % Book value per common share $ 15.37 15.46 14.59 (0.09 ) 0.78 Tangible book value per common share $ 12.91 12.99 12.51 (0.08 ) 0.40 Tangible stockholders’ equity of $1.007 billion at December 31, 2017 decreased $6.5 million compared to the prior quarter which was the result of a decrease in accumulated other comprehensive income. Tangible stockholders’ equity increased $49.6 million, or 5 percent, from a year ago, the result of earnings retention and $46.7 million of Company stock issued in connection with the Foothills acquisition; such increases more than offset the increase in goodwill and core deposit intangibles. Tangible book value per common share at quarter end decreased $0.08 per share from the prior quarter and increased $0.40 per share from a year ago.\nCash Dividend\nOn November 15, 2017, the Company’s Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.21 per share.

Interest income on commercial loans increased $1.5 million, or 2 percent, from the prior quarter and increased $11.6 million, or 23 percent, from the prior year fourth quarter. As a result of the shrinking investment portfolio, interest income from investments decreased $1.3 million from the prior quarter and $3.0 million from the prior year fourth quarter.\nThe current quarter interest expense of $7.1 million decreased $580 thousand, or 8 percent, from the prior quarter and was driven primarily by the decrease in wholesale deposits. Current quarter interest expense decreased $142 thousand, or 2 percent, from the prior year fourth quarter. The total cost of funding (including non-interest bearing deposits) for the current quarter was 33 basis points compared to 35 basis points for the prior quarter and 36 basis points for the prior year fourth quarter.\nThe Company’s net interest margin as a percentage of earning assets, on a tax-equivalent basis, for the current quarter was 4.23 percent compared to 4.11 percent in the prior quarter. The 12 basis points increase in the net interest margin was the result of an 11 basis points increase on the earning asset yield and a decrease of 2 basis points in cost of funds. The increase in earning asset yield was primarily driven by the continuing shift of lower yielding investments to higher yielding loans coupled with increased yields on loans and investments. The decrease in cost of funds was driven by the decrease in wholesale deposits which more than offset the increase in interest expense on FHLB advances. The current quarter net interest margin increased 21 basis points over the prior year fourth quarter net interest margin of 4.02 percent, due to the remix of earning assets to higher yielding loans and higher yielding earning assets.\nNon-interest Income\nNon-interest income for the current quarter totaled $27.7 million, a decrease of $3.5 million, or 11 percent, from the prior quarter and a decrease of $305 thousand, or 1 percent, over the same quarter last year. Service charges and other fees of $17.3 million, increased $1.6 million, or 10 percent, from the prior year fourth quarter primarily from the increased number of accounts. Gain on sale of loans for the current quarter decreased $1.7 million, or 19 percent, from the prior quarter as a result of a seasonal slowdown in purchase activity. Gain on sale of loans decreased $2.4 million, or 24 percent, from the prior year fourth quarter as a result of decreased refinance and purchase activity. Other income of $2.1 million, decreased $1.4 million, or 40 percent, over the prior quarter due to the decrease in gain on sale of other real estate owned (“OREO”). Gain on sale of OREO during the fourth quarter of 2017 was $62.7 thousand compared to $1.5 million in the prior quarter.\nNon-interest Expense Summary\nThree Months ended (Dollars in thousands) Dec 31,\n2017 Sep 30,\n2017 Jun 30,\n2017 Mar 31,\n2017 Dec 31,\n2016 Compensation and employee benefits $ 40,465 41,297 39,498 39,246 38,826 Occupancy and equipment 6,925 6,500 6,560 6,646 6,692 Advertising and promotions 2,024 2,239 2,169 1,973 2,125 Data processing 3,970 3,647 3,409 3,124 3,408 Other real estate owned 377 817 442 273 2,076 Regulatory assessments and insurance 1,069 1,214 1,087 1,061 1,048 Core deposit intangibles amortization 614 640 639 601 608 Other expenses 12,922 12,198 11,505 10,420 11,934 Total non-interest expense $ 68,366 68,552 65,309 63,344 66,717 $ Change from (Dollars in thousands) Sep 30,\n2017 Jun 30,\n2017 Mar 31,\n2017 Dec 31,\n2016 Compensation and employee benefits $ (832 ) 967 1,219 1,639 Occupancy and equipment 425 365 279 233 Advertising and promotions (215 ) (145 ) 51 (101 ) Data processing 323 561 846 562 Other real estate owned (440 ) (65 ) 104 (1,699 ) Regulatory assessments and insurance (145 ) (18 ) 8 21 Core deposit intangibles amortization (26 ) (25 ) 13 6 Other expense 724 1,417 2,502 988 Total non-interest expense $ (186 ) 3,057 5,022 1,649 During 2016, the Company consolidated its Bank divisions’ individual core database systems into a single core database and re-issued debit cards with chip technology (the Core Consolidation Project or “CCP”). Expenses related to CCP were $741 thousand during the fourth quarter of 2016. Excluding CCP expenses, non-interest expense for the current quarter increased $2.4 million, or 4 percent, over the prior year fourth quarter.\nCompensation and employee benefits increased by $1.6 million, or 4 percent, from the prior year fourth quarter due to salary increases and the increased number of employees from acquisitions. Data processing expense increased $323 thousand, or 9 percent, from the prior quarter and increased $562, or 16 percent, from the prior year fourth quarter. Other expenses increased $724 thousand, or 6 percent from the prior quarter and increased $988 thousand, or 8 percent, from the prior year fourth quarter with changes in several categories and the primary increase was from acquisition related expenses.\nFederal and State Income Tax Expense\nTax expense during the fourth quarter of 2017 was $31.3 million, an increase $19.7 million, or 169 percent, over the prior quarter and an increase of $21.7 million, or 224 percent, over the prior year fourth quarter with the increases due to the revaluation of the Company’s net deferred tax asset. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to the years in which the temporary differences are expected to be recognized. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities from a change in tax rates is recognized in net income in the period that includes the enactment date which occurred on December 22, 2017 with the enactment of the Tax Act. The current year federal marginal rate was 35 percent and will decrease to 21 percent in 2018. Excluding the impact of the Tax Act, the effective federal and state income tax rate for the Company was 25.1 percent in 2017 and is expected to decrease to a range of 17 to 18 percent during 2018 as a result of the Tax Act.\nEfficiency Ratio\nThe current quarter efficiency ratio was 54.02 percent, a 58 basis points increase from the prior quarter efficiency ratio of 53.44 percent which was primarily driven by a seasonal slowing of residential refinance and purchase activity which caused a decrease in the gain on sale of loans. The current quarter efficiency ratio decreased 106 basis points from the prior year fourth quarter ratio of 55.08 percent and was attributable to the increase in net interest income primarily due to higher interest income on commercial loans. “The Bank divisions’ success in growing loans at higher yields while controlling funding costs throughout the year is reflected in the efficiency ratio improvement,” said Ron Copher, Chief Financial Officer.\nOperating Results for Year ended December 31, 2017\nCompared to December 31, 2016\nIncome Summary\nYear ended (Dollars in thousands) Dec 31,\n2017 Dec 31,\n2016 $ Change % Change Net interest income Interest income $ 375,022 $ 344,153 $ 30,869 9 % Interest expense 29,864 29,631 233 1 % Total net interest income 345,158 314,522 30,636 10 % Non-interest income Service charges and other fees 67,717 62,405 5,312 9 % Miscellaneous loan fees and charges 4,360 4,613 (253 ) (5 )% Gain on sale of loans 30,439 33,606 (3,167 ) (9 )% Loss on sale of investments (660 ) (1,463 ) 803 (55 )% Other income 10,383 8,157 2,226 27 % Total non-interest income 112,239 107,318 4,921 5 % $ 457,397 $ 421,840 $ 35,557 8 % Net interest margin (tax-equivalent) 4.12 % 4.02 % Net Interest Income\nInterest income for the current year increased $30.9 million, or 9 percent, from the prior year and was attributable to a $38.4 million increase in income from commercial loans which more than offset the decrease of $8.4 million in interest income on investments.\nInterest expense of $29.9 million for the current year increased $233 thousand over the prior year. Interest expense on deposits decreased $1.6 million, or 9 percent, and was due to the decrease in wholesale deposits. Interest expense on repurchase agreements, FHLB advances, and subordinated debt increased $1.8 million, or 16 percent, over the prior year and was primarily driven by the increase in interest rates. The total funding cost (including non-interest bearing deposits) for 2017 was 36 basis points compared to 37 basis points for 2016.\nThe net interest margin as a percentage of earning assets, on a tax-equivalent basis, for 2017 was 4.12 percent, a 10 basis point increase from the net interest margin of 4.02 percent for 2016. The increase in the margin was primarily attributable to a shift in earning assets to higher yielding loans. Additionally, there was an increase in yields on earning assets combined with a continued increase in low cost deposits during the current year.\nNon-interest Income\nNon-interest income of $112.2 million for 2017 increased $4.9 million, or 5 percent, over last year. Service charges and other fees of $67.7 million for 2017 increased $5.3 million, or 9 percent, from the prior year as a result of an increased number of deposit accounts. The gain on sale of loans of $30.4 million for 2017 decreased $3.2 million, or 9 percent, from prior year which was due to a lower volume of refinanced and purchased mortgages. Other income of $10.4 million for 2017 increased $2.2 million, or 27 percent, over last year and was the result of an increase on gain on sale of OREO.\nNon-interest Expense Summary\nYear ended (Dollars in thousands) Dec 31,\n2017 Dec 31,\n2016 $ Change % Change Compensation and employee benefits $ 160,506 $ 151,697 $ 8,809 6 % Occupancy and equipment 26,631 25,979 652 3 % Advertising and promotions 8,405 8,433 (28 ) — % Data processing 14,150 14,390 (240 ) (2 )% Other real estate owned 1,909 2,895 (986 ) (34 )% Regulatory assessments and insurance 4,431 4,780 (349 ) (7 )% Core deposit intangibles amortization 2,494 2,970 (476 ) (16 )% Other expenses 47,045 47,570 (525 ) (1 )% Total non-interest expense $ 265,571 $ 258,714 $ 6,857 3 % Expenses related to CCP were $4.3 million during 2016. Excluding CCP expenses, non-interest expense for the current year increased $11.2 million, or 4 percent, over the prior year. Compensation and employee benefits for 2017 increased $8.8 million, or 6 percent, from the same period last year due to salary increases and the increased number of employees from the acquired banks. Occupancy and equipment expense increased $652 thousand, or 3 percent from the prior year as a result of increased costs from acquisitions. Data processing expense decreased $240 thousand, or 2 percent, from the prior year as a result of decreased costs associated with CCP. Current year other expenses of $47.0 million decreased $525 thousand, or 1 percent, from the prior year and was principally driven by decreased costs associated with CCP.\nProvision for Loan Losses\nThe provision for loan losses was $10.8 million for 2017, an increase of $8.5 million from the same period in the prior year. Net charge-offs during 2017 were $10.8 million compared to $2.5 million during 2016.\nFederal and State Income Tax Expense\nTax expense of $64.6 million in 2017 increased $25.0 million, or 63 percent, over the prior year as a result of the $19.7 million revaluation of the Company’s deferred tax asset related to the Tax Act.\nEfficiency Ratio\nThe efficiency ratio of 53.94 percent for 2017 decreased 194 basis points from the prior year efficiency ratio of 55.88 percent which resulted from the increase in net interest income largely due to higher interest income on commercial loans.\nForward-Looking Statements\nThis news release may contain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.
