The sector, which accounts for half of China’s GDP, expanded 7.8 percent in the bureau’s initial estimate to 38.4 trillion yuan.\nThe revisions were mainly due to small cuts in the bureau’s estimates for the size of the financial and tech sectors, which grew 4.5 percent and 18.1 percent in the final numbers, respectively, down from 5.7 percent and 22.2 percent in the earlier data release.\nBranches are pictured in front of buildings in Beijing's central business area, China December 14, 2017. REUTERS/Jason Lee Growth estimates for manufacturing, agriculture, construction and real estate remain unchanged.\nChina’s 2016 GDP grew at its slowest pace in more than a quarter of a century as the government pushed through painful structural reforms in the economy.\nGDP is expected to have expanded 6.8 percent in 2017, exceeding the government’s target of around 6.5 percent. But growth will likely slow to 6.4 percent this year, economists say.\nProperty investment and construction are expected to lose steam as more cities try to curb surging housing prices, while a government campaign against riskier lending pushes up borrowing costs and a crackdown on pollution hurts some factories.\nThe government will keep its GDP growth target at “around 6.5 percent” in this year, policy sources told Reuters.\nReporting by Ryan Woo; Editing by Sam Holmes\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-05T04:41:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-05T05:11:36.004+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
