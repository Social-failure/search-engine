Fueling those hopes has been the president’s refraining from harsh anti-Nafta rhetoric since his last tweet regarding the pact in August. \n“We’re doing everything we can to have our voices heard,” said Sen. Deb Fischer (R., Neb.), a rancher and one of several lawmakers who attended a steak lunch with Trump in December. Sen. Joni Ernst (R., Iowa) brought a chart showing a negative impact of Trump’s anti-Nafta messages on hog futures. Last week, Senate Agriculture Committee Chairman Pat Roberts (R., Kan.) led another group to the White House to reinforce the message. \nWhite House officials say Trump has continued to meet with “stakeholders on all sides” on the issue. One official familiar with the strategy said that in staying relatively quiet on Nafta, the president is giving U.S. negotiators maximum leverage in the talks.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-08T05:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-08T05:28:48.013+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
