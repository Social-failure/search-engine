But the individual income tax cuts are skewed toward higher-income households, which economists say have a low propensity to consume more as taxes fall. \nMany economists also believe companies will use much of the windfall on stock buybacks and debt reduction rather than capital expenditure. \nWilliams said the cuts should have a “modest, positive effect” on economic growth over the next three years due to consumer spending and business investment. He expects gross domestic product growth of 2.5 percent in 2018, in line with overall Fed estimates, as well as a modest boost to the labor force and productivity, which has been surprisingly weak through the recovery from recession. \nThe U.S. economy will be “in a very positive place two years from now: I think we’ll be at 2 percent inflation and around 4 percent unemployment,” Williams said.
