Additionally, the Company also announced the expansion of its board of directors from five to seven members and the appointments of Mr. David Geenberg and Mr. Michael Hanna as new independent board members, effective immediately.\nMr. Quarls said, “I am very pleased by what we have been able to accomplish since the Company’s emergence from bankruptcy in September 2016. We have rebuilt the capabilities of the Company to be a top performer in the Eagle Ford; managed a strategic alternatives process; and completed two accretive, strategic acquisitions in our core area which have increased production and operated inventory by over 50%. The Company is now favorably positioned for the future. However, this effort has required a significant commitment of my time, which is limiting my ability to spend time with other opportunities, including time with my family. With these accomplishments, now is a good time to step away and dedicate my time elsewhere. I thank all the employees at Penn Virginia and its board for the chance to work with them on this terrific journey. I wish all continued success.”\nUpon Mr. Quarls’ retirement, Penn Virginia’s board of directors will be reduced from seven members to six members, and each of Mr. Darin G. Holderness and Mr. Geenberg will serve as the non-executive Co-Chairman of Penn Virginia’s board of directors. The Company plans to conduct a search for a new director and Chairman who is not a shareholder representative and who has oil and gas industry expertise. Mr. Quarls has also agreed to provide consulting services for the Company through the end of 2018.\n“Harry has been instrumental in the Company’s turnaround and his leadership will be missed,” said John A. Brooks, President and Chief Executive Officer. “His experience, energy, commitment and knowledge served the Company well over the last year and a half and positions Penn Virginia well for the future. With our focus on the future, we believe the insight that Michael and David will provide as to the perspectives of our shareholders as well as their expertise in finance will prove to be an invaluable asset to Penn Virginia.”\nMr. Geenberg is Co-Head of US Investment Team of Strategic Value Partners, LLC (“SVP”), which together with its affiliates manage certain investment funds and accounts that hold approximately 10.2% of the Company’s outstanding common stock, respectively. Mr. Geenberg joined SVP in 2009, and since such time, he has led the firm’s investment efforts in the infrastructure, energy, and power sectors in North America, serving on the steering committees of more than a dozen significant restructurings. Previously, Mr. Geenberg worked at Goldman, Sachs & Co., most recently in the Infrastructure Investment Group and Principal Investment Area focused on energy and transportation infrastructure businesses, and, prior to that, in the investment bank’s Natural Resources Group. Mr. Geenberg received a B.A. in Economics summa cum laude from Dartmouth College in 2005. The board of directors believes Mr. Geenberg’s experience in advising and investing in the energy industry will bring value to the Company. In connection with Mr. Geenberg’s election to the board of directors, SVP and Mr. Geenberg have entered into a standstill and support agreement with the Company, pursuant to which, among other things, during the standstill period SVP will vote its shares of common stock in favor of the board’s recommendation with respect to director nominations and other routine matters submitted to a vote of the Company’s Shareholders.\nMr. Hanna is a Partner and Portfolio Manager of KLS Diversified Asset Management (“KLS”), which beneficially owns approximately 7.7% of the Company’s outstanding common stock.
