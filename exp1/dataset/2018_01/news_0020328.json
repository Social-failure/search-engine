REUTERS/Edgar Su/File Photo CATCH-UP \nHyundai is also looking to catch up with its peers in future mobility, the personal transport innovations from ride-sharing to self-driving cars that are expected to reshape the auto industry. \nWhile it does offer car-sharing services in the United States and Europe, until now it has watched from the sidelines as competitors like GM ( GM.N ) and Toyota ( 7203.T ) have allied with ride-sharing partners. \nHyundai and Grab said they would jointly develop services in Southeast Asia, including one utilizing Hyundai’s eco-friendly models such as the IONIQ Electric. They did not disclose the value of Hyundai’s investment. \nHyundai last week announced for the first time a self-driving technology partnership with Silicon Valley start-up Aurora, a shift from its usual preference for developing technology itself. \nThe Hyundai tie-up is part of Grab’s latest financing round that raised $2.5 billion and included Chinese peer Didi Chuxing, Japan’s SoftBank Group Corp ( 9984.T ) and Toyota Tsusho ( 8015.T ), a Grab spokeswoman said. \nHyundai Motor vice chairman Chung Eui-sun said on Wednesday it is considering building a car plant in Southeast Asia, possibly in Indonesia or Vietnam.
