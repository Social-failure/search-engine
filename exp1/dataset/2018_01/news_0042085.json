Britain says a transition period should provide clarity for business and financial services firms. \nMay said that she sensed a pragmatic attitude among EU leaders to get an arrangement which works for Britain and the EU, but would not be drawn as to whether she would offer concessions to the EU to secure a favourable deal for the finance industry. \n“What I‘m working for is looking at the implementation period .. But I‘m very clear that we want to develop a deep and special partnership - a comprehensive free trade agreement,” she said. \n“Obviously we recognise the importance of financial services and we want to ensure that we can continue to see those financial services ensuring that the City of London retains its role as a global financial centre.” Reporting by Alistair Smout; editing by Guy Faulconbridge", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-25T13:44:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-25T14:45:48.008+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
