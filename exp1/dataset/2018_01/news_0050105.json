If he says that, what can I say? I have been here 18 months and I think English football is not like this. \n“He has spent all his career in England and that is why his opinions are his opinions. What can I say?” \nCity, 12 points clear at the top of the Premier League, on Wednesday host a West Bromwich Albion side that knocked Liverpool out of the FA Cup at Anfield on Saturday.
