(NASDAQ:FCBC) ( www.firstcommunitybank.com ) (the “Company”) today reported its unaudited results of operations and other financial information for the quarter and year ended December 31, 2017. The Company reported net income of $1.21 million, or $0.07 per diluted common share for the quarter ended December 31, 2017, and $21.49 million, or $1.26 per diluted common share for the year ended December 31, 2017.\nOn December 22, 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “Tax Reform Act”), was enacted into law. The Tax Reform Act reduces the federal tax rate for corporations from 35% to 21%, effective January 1, 2018, and changes, or limits, certain tax deductions. As a result of the new law, generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (“GAAP”) require the immediate revaluation of deferred tax assets to a value reflective of the lower corporate tax rate. During the fourth quarter of 2017, the Company recorded a one-time estimated revaluation adjustment of approximately $6.55 million to reduce its net deferred tax asset, which increased the provision for income taxes.\nExcluding the impact of the non-cash revaluation, fourth quarter earnings were $7.77 million, or $0.45 per diluted share, an increase of $1.36 million, or 21.25%, over fourth quarter 2016. Full year earnings exclusive of the revaluation were $28.04 million, an increase of $2.91 million, or 11.59%, over 2016 earnings. Adjusted return on assets and equity were 1.18% and 8.02%, respectively, both significant increases over the prior year.\nThe Company also announced today that the Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend to common shareholders of eighteen cents ($0.18) per common share. The quarterly dividend is payable to common shareholders of record on February 2, 2018, and is expected to be paid on or about February 16, 2018. The current year marks the 33 rd consecutive year of regular cash dividends paid to stockholders.\nFourth Quarter 2017 Highlights\nIncome Statement Net income totaled $1.21 million, or $0.07 per diluted common share for the fourth quarter of 2017. Excluding the impact of the one-time deferred tax asset revaluation, earnings increased $1.36 million, or 21.25% to $7.77 million and diluted earnings per share increased $0.07 to $0.45 compared to the same quarter of 2016. The non-GAAP efficiency ratio improved to 57.04% compared to 61.58% in the same quarter of 2016. Net interest margin increased 18 basis points to 4.17%, and normalized net interest margin increased 12 basis points to 3.95% compared to the same quarter of 2016. Balance Sheet Net charge-offs decreased $2.10 million, or 59.23%, to $1.44 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to the same period of 2016. Book value per common share increased $0.68 to $20.63 compared to December 31, 2016. Tangible book value per common share increased $0.75 to $14.64 compared to December 31, 2016. The Company and its subsidiary bank both significantly exceed regulatory “well capitalized” targets as of December 31, 2017.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nThe Company prepares its financial statements in accordance with GAAP. This press release also refers to certain non-GAAP financial measures that the Company believes provide investors with important information, when used in conjunction with results presented in accordance with GAAP, regarding its operational performance. The Company’s non-GAAP financial measures presented in this release include core earnings, the efficiency ratio, tangible book value per common share, average tangible common equity, and normalized net interest margin. Management believes that core earnings provide the Company and investors a valuable tool to evaluate the Company’s financial results. Management believes that the efficiency ratio provides important information about the Company’s operating expense control and efficiency of operations. Management also believes this ratio focuses attention on the core operating performance of the Company over time and is highly useful in comparing period-to-period operating performance of core business operations. The efficiency ratio used by the Company may not be comparable to efficiency ratios reported by other financial institutions. The reconciliations of these measures to GAAP measures are provided within this news release.\nAbout First Community Bancshares, Inc.\nFirst Community Bancshares, Inc., a financial holding company headquartered in Bluefield, Virginia, provides banking products and services through its wholly owned subsidiary First Community Bank.
