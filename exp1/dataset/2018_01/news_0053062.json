But their payments soared when the franc rose, particularly after Switzerland scrapped its cap on the currency’s value in January 2015.\nCancelling those loans now would be “unjust” to people who took loans in euros and whose risks are not being eliminated, said the head of the bank association, Stanislava Zadravec Caprirolo.\nSome 6,000 borrowers have outstanding real-estate loans in Swiss francs worth 430 million euros, and only 3 percent of those loans are not being repaid, Zadravec said. Outstanding real estate loans total roughly 6 billion euros, and about 3 percent of those are not being repaid as well.\nThe Slovenian unit of the Austrian bank Sparkasse, whose loan was nullified, told Reuters it disagreed with the ruling and would “use all legal means” to fight against it. It gave no further details.\nThe Bank Association pointed out the same court - the appellate High Court in Ljubljana - ruled differently in two cases, so “the latest ruling does not represent a precedent”.\nIt said a January 2017 ruling rejected all borrowers’ demands and confirmed that the loans in Swiss francs were legitimate. A September 2017 ruling returned the case to a lower court.\nThe association also rejected a draft law that was proposed by opposition members of parliament and would convert all Swiss franc loans into euro loans, using the exchange rate on the day the law was taken. The association said each loan case has to be considered separately.
