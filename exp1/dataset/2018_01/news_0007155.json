REUTERS/Srdjan Zivulovic \nIt was her seventh win in the last eight races in all disciplines, her form peaking with the Winter Olympics in Pyeongchang just one month away, and the 40th World Cup win of her career. \nShiffrin is widely expected to retain the Olympic slalom title she won at the 2014 Games in Sochi, Russia, as well as having a shot at gold medals in the giant slalom and Super G. \n“I was really aggressive, especially the first run,” she told Swiss television, adding that she did not take an interest in passing the 40-win milestone. \n“It doesn’t mean so much,” she said. “I‘m not focusing on that, I‘m really happy with my skiing right now and that’s what I‘m focusing on.” Alpine Skiing - FIS Alpine Skiing World Cup - Women's Slalom - Kranjska Gora, Slovenia - January 7, 2018 - Mikaela Shiffrin of the U.S. in action.
