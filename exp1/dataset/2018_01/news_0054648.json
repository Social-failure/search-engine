It’s about ALL of us. Which is why your name deserves to be displayed during Tuesday night’s speech.” \nThe web page allows donors to give as much as $2,700, the maximum allowed per election. \nIn his speech, Trump is expected to tout the economy and recently enacted tax cuts while also emphasizing his calls for tougher immigration policies and for an infrastructure package.
