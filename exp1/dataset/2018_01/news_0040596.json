TransCanada has still not made a final investment decision. \nThe Nebraska commission approved the pipeline, but not TransCanada’s preferred path. The new, approved route will add $100 million to $200 million in cost, Girling said. \n“We’re committed to moving this project forward but .. we’ve got a lot of bruises of not being really careful,” he said. “So we’ll just be really careful with how we spend our money through the next 12 months.” \nThe pipeline would increase the flow of landlocked heavy crude oil from Alberta to U.S. refineries. \nTransCanada is focused on acquiring additional right of way for the route change, a process that should last until the third or fourth quarter, in time to start construction next year, Girling said. \nLast week, TransCanada said it had lined up enough long-term commitments from shippers for the pipeline. \nTransCanada shares fell 2 percent in Toronto to C$58.02, compared with a 0.9 percent drop for the exchange’s energy index. \nReporting by Rod Nickel in Winnipeg, Manitoba; Editing by Susan Thomas and Peter Cooney\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-01-26T03:31:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-25T21:32:01.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
