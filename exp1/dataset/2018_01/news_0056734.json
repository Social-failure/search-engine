It is also working with the Army Corps of Engineers to develop a potential replacement rule that “would revise the definition of waters of the United States.” \nThe water rule has been bogged down in legal challenges. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit issued a nationwide stay of the rule, halting its planned August 2015 implementation. \nBut last week the Supreme Court determined that federal circuit courts do not have original jurisdiction to review these challenges and they should be dealt with by district courts. \n“Given uncertainty about litigation in multiple district courts over the 2015 Rule, this action provides much needed certainty and clarity to the regulated community during the ongoing regulatory process,” the EPA said in a press release Wednesday. \nPruitt told Reuters in an interview earlier this month that he aims to finalize a revamped rule by year-end.
