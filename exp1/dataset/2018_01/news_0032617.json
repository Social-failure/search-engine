Slideshow (5 Images) \nVisiting winger Wilfried Zaha looked sharp and had one late shot on target but striker Christian Benteke gestured in frustration at the lack of service from his team mates. \nBenteke came close to scoring on the hour as Palace raced up the field on the break, only to thump the ball straight at onrushing keeper Petr Cech. \nPalace captain Luka Milivojevic scored in the 78th minute, chesting the ball down before turning and shooing into the corner, but the result had long been beyond doubt by then.
