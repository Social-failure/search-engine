He maintains his innocence, saying natural gas and not methane gas and excess coal dust caused the explosion.\n\"It was not what government said it was,\" he said. \"It was not a dust explosion. It was a gas explosion. The science will show that.\"\n\"I will continue to file motions and paperwork, if you will, to try to get the verdict invalidated,\" he added.\nBlankenship launched his campaign to unseat moderate Democrat Joe Manchin on Thursday evening, just miles north of heart of West Virginia's southern coalfields.\nHe told CNBC his politics align with President Donald Trump and the GOP on fiscal and social issues.\n\"The candidates I'm running against, two of them have supported Hillary [Clinton] in the past. She didn't do too well in West Virginia. And the third one is from New Jersey and New York. So I think I have a pretty good chance,\" Blankenship said, positioning himself as a businessman who gives to charity and has worked to change his state for the better.\nTrump won West Virginia by a landslide in the 2016 president election against Clinton.\nBlankenship said he would not expect to get a Trump endorsement in the Republican primary but sees the president supporting the GOP candidate against incumbent Manchin.\n— The Associated Press contributed to this report.\nMorning Squawk: CNBC's before the bell news roundup Sign up to get Morning Squawk each weekday\nJob Industry Advertising/Marketing Automotive Communications/PR Construction/Manufacturing Education Finance/Banking/Insurance Legal Media/Entertainment Medical/Health Care Mining/Oil/Gas/Utilities Gov't/Non-Profit Real Estate Retail Technology/IT Transportation/Shipping Travel/Hospitality Other Get this delivered to your inbox, and more info about about our products and service.
