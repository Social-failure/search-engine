Previously, only physicians could prescribe the medication.\nIt cited a 2017 study published by the National Rural Health Association that found 53 percent of rural counties had no physician able to prescribe buprenorphine.\nThe opioid crisis is a leading cause of death in the United States, killing more than 42,000 people in 2016, the highest death toll of any year on record, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\nIn October, Trump declared the crisis a public health emergency, which redirected federal resources and loosened regulations to combat opioid abuse.\nReporting by Yasmeen Abutaleb; Editing by Richard Chang\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-01-24T02:42:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-24T15:33:33.041+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
