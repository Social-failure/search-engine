He named his former finance minister, Felipe Larrain, to fill the same spot again in his new cabinet. Writer Roberto Ampuero will be foreign minister.\nPinera’s election last month was broadly in line with Chile’s longstanding free-market economic model. But his victory underscored an increasing tilt to the right in South America following the rise of conservative leaders in Peru, Argentina and Brazil. He is due to be sworn in March 11.\nPinera pledges to jump-start economic growth with more business-friendly policies than his center-left predecessor.\nReporting by Fabian Cambero; Editing by Chizu Nomiyama and Jeffrey Benkoe\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-23T17:08:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-23T17:26:37.037+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
