Iraq is OPEC’s second-largest producer after Saudi Arabia. \nIraq has had to limit its output as the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries is reducing output by about 1.2 million barrels per day (bpd) as part of a deal with Russia and other non-OPEC producers until the end of 2018. \n“Iraq has made it clear at every time and every event that Iraq will comply with OPEC declarations in good spirit, genuine spirit,” the minister said. \nHe said Iraq hoped to more than double production from the northern Kirkuk oilfields with the help of BP. \nWhile exports from the south are at record levels, output in northern Iraq is down after falling in mid-October when Iraqi forces retook control of oilfields from Kurdish fighters who had been there since 2014. \nThis has had the side-effect of boosting Iraqi compliance with the OPEC cut. \nThe minister said the oil market was improving, helped by the OPEC deal.
