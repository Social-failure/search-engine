I know her pretty well. I know she’s very strong opponent, very strong player. \n”But I started to like this tournament. After two years in a row losing in the first round, now it’s a better result. Tennis - Australian Open - Quarterfinals - Rod Laver Arena, Melbourne, Australia, January 24, 2018. Angelique Kerber of Germany hits a shot against Madison Keys of the U.S. REUTERS/Issei Kato \n“I just want to go there and to give everything I have like I did the last matches.” \nKerber conserved energy for the looming clash as she thrashed Madison Keys earlier on Rod Laver Arena and also is ready to work overtime against Halep. \n“I think it will be a long match with a lot of long rallies. I played against her a lot of times, and it was always tough and close,” the 21st seed said. \nHalep rolled her ankle in her opening match against Destanee Aiava last week and admits the pain prevented her from sleeping one night at the weekend. \nIt is hardly ideal when a player of Kerber’s pedigree is blocking her path to the final and another chance to win a first grand slam title, but Halep offered an encouraging medical report after dispatching Pliskova. \n“I was just worried about how is going to be the next day, the ankle,” she said. “But was pretty strong. It is pretty strong. After this I will take care better of it.” Reporting by Martyn Herman; Editing by John O'Brien", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-24T12:25:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-24T12:41:32.112+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
