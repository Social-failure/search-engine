Moroccan investor M Avenue will finance and own it.\n“It is a brand that will grow ... In the next three to five years we will quickly double the number of the hotels,” Roquette told reporters, mentioning Ibiza and Milan among possible locations.\nPestana, which has a hotel in Casablanca, is also opening a separate 4-star hotel in Marrakesh and hopes to expand further in the north African country.\nPestana CEO told Reuters in December the joint venture should help open new markets in Asia and the Middle East, where Ronaldo is extremely popular, as well as reinforce its expansion into Spain and the United States.\nRonaldo and Pestana will open two hotels this year in Madrid and New York, having already tested the market at home in Portugal, which is enjoying a tourism boom, with an initial two hotels - in Madeira and Lisbon.\nPestana is a family-owned chain of more than 90 upmarket hotels. It aims to open 20 more, including under the CR7 brand, on an investment of 200 million euros by the end of the decade, mostly in Portugal, Roquette said.
