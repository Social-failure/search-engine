REUTERS/Toru Hanai \nKarlovic faced four break points in the second game of the deciding set but saved all four, one with a second-serve ace. He then struck decisively in the 21st game of the set when he moved forward to force a forehand error from his opponent. \nHe completed victory a game later with a nerveless backhand volley and now sets his sights on another battle.

It’s going to be very hot and that will make my serve a little faster. But it will not be easy.” Reporting   Amlan Chakraborty/Nick Mulvenney", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-17T09:23:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-17T10:05:26.071+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
