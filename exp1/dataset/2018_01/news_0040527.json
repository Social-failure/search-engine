REUTERS/Kevin Lamarque/File Photo \nThough Finland backs western economic sanctions against Russia, Niinisto has appeared as a low-profile middle-man between East and West - a sharp contrast to his Baltic counterparts who regularly speak out against Moscow. \nHe was the first western leader to meet Russian president Vladimir Putin following the annexation of the Ukrainian peninsula. \nAttending a NATO summit in Warsaw in July 2016, along with Sweden, he also actively pushed for an air safety agreement between Russia and the alliance in the Baltic region after a series of near misses between Russian jets and commercial European airlines.

I think we have no reason to seek NATO membership,” Niinisto said in a TV interview with public broadcaster YLE this month. \n“But, if Russia suddenly starts to see the whole of the West as an enemy, as it views NATO at the moment, then we are in a different situation,” he said. \nPublic backing for joining NATO has lingered around 20 percent for years, although it briefly edged up in 2014 after Russia’s action in Crimea. \nApart from his long service in politics, Niinisto also taps into much sympathy among Finns because of a series of personal dramas. \nA lawyer by training, Niinisto was the finance minister in the 1990s, becoming known for his government’s heavy austerity measures following Finland’s depression, as well as the decision to join the euro area. \nQuick-tempered in politics, he lost his first wife in a car accident in 1995. He survived the deadly 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami by climbing up an electricity pole in Thailand with his son.
