Of the total sum, 1.35 trillion rupees is planned to be raised through recapitalisation bonds, while the banks themselves will raise another 580 billion rupees from share sales.\n“Each public sector bank (PSB) is an article of faith. All PSBs will be adequately capitalised and enabled to serve people and support inclusive growth,” said Kumar, adding total capital injection including from the government’s budget and share sales by banks will amount to over 1 trillion rupees ($15.70 billion) in the financial year ending March 2018.\n$1 = 63.6875 Indian rupees Reporting by Neha Dasgupta and Devidutta Tripathy; Writing by Euan Rocha\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-01-24T18:45:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-25T13:02:52.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
