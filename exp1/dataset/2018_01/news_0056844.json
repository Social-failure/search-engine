Net income for Q4 2017, excluding the impact of significant items including tax reform and other tax related items, legal reserves, and a settlement with the former CEO (\"Adjusted 1 \"), totaled $98 million, or $0.27 per diluted common share.

Passing the Federal Reserve's capital stress test and our relationship with Santander Group provide us with the balance sheet flexibility to support our business objectives in 2018.\"\n2017 Regulatory and Business Milestones:\nThe Federal Reserve Bank of Boston (\"Federal Reserve\") terminated the 2014 Written Agreement with SC's majority owner, Santander Holdings USA, Inc. (\"SHUSA\"), following its non-objection to SHUSA's Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review submission. SHUSA and SC now operate within a normal capital cycle, and SC completed its first cash dividend payment to shareholders since 2014. SHUSA and Banco Santander (\"Santander\") increased their total ownership in SC to approximately 68.1%, following Santander's acquisition from SC's former CEO of 9.6% of SC's outstanding shares, which it transferred to SHUSA.

Announced key appointments and changes to its management team, including Scott Powell as CEO, Juan Carlos Alvarez as CFO, Sandra Broderick as EVP, Head of Operations, and Rich Morrin, as President of Chrysler Capital and Auto Relationships.\nFull Year 2017 Key Financial Highlights (variances compared to full year 2016 (\"2016 \" )):\nTotal auto originations of $20.1 billion, down 8% Finance receivables, loans and leases, net 2 , increased 2%, to $34.8 billion at December 31, 2017, from $34.2 billion at December 31, 2016 Net finance and other interest income of $4.3 billion, down 9% RIC gross charge-off ratio of 17.9%, up 60 basis points, stabilizing compared to a 230 basis point increase from 2015 to 2016 RIC net charge-off ratio of 8.9%, up 60 basis points, compared to a 140 basis point increase from 2015 to 2016 Return on average assets (\"ROA\") of 3.0% and Adjusted ROA of 1.6%, down from 2.0% Expense ratio of 2.6% and Adjusted expense ratio of 2.3%, up from 2.2%\nFourth Quarter of 2017 Key Financial Highlights (variances compared to fourth quarter of 2016 (\"Q4 2016 \" )):\nTotal auto originations of $4.3 billion, down 5% Core retail auto originations of $1.5 billion, down 27% Chrysler Capital loan originations of $1.5 billion, flat Chrysler Capital lease originations of $1.3 billion, up 31% Net finance and other interest income of $1.0 billion, down 11% ROA of 6.0% and Adjusted ROA of 1.0%, up from 0.6% CET1 ratio of 16.3% $2.2 billion in ABS offered and sold\nSubsequent Events:\nPartnered with Santander InnoVentures, a Santander corporate venture fund, during the first quarter of 2018, to become a lending choice on AutoFi's online finance platform to streamline and simplify the car buying process for consumers, while providing dealers a robust digital sales channel.\n\"Fourth quarter results demonstrate continued stabilization in credit performance following Hurricanes Harvey and Irma,\" said Juan Carlos Alvarez, SC CFO. \"As we head into 2018 our goal is to leverage our network and improve our dealer experience, including with Fiat Chrysler, while remaining focused on risk-adjusted returns and disciplined expense management.\"\nNet finance and other interest income decreased 11 percent, to $1.0 billion in Q4 2017 from $1.1 billion in Q4 2016, primarily driven by lower average RIC balances and an increase in benchmark rates.\nServicing fee income decreased 19 percent to $26 million in Q4 2017, from $32 million in Q4 2016, driven by lower prime originations and lower prime asset sales. SC's serviced for others portfolio of $8.6 billion as of Q4 2017, is down 28 percent from $11.9 billion in Q4 2016.\nRIC delinquency ratio 3 increased to 5.4 percent in Q4 2017, from 5.1 percent in Q4 2016, primarily due to a lower portfolio balance.\nRIC net charge-off ratio 4 increased to 10.3 percent in Q4 2017, from 9.9 percent in Q4 2016. Provision for credit loss decreased to $562 million in Q4 2017, from $686 million in Q4 2016.\nAllowance ratio 5 decreased 20 basis points, to 12.6 percent at the end of Q4 2017, from 12.8 percent at the end of Q3 2017.\nRecorded net investment losses were $138 million in Q4 2017, compared to net investment losses of $168 million in Q4 2016. The current period losses were primarily driven by held for sale accounting for SC's personal lending portfolio 6 .\nDuring the quarter, SC incurred $426 million of operating expenses, up 44 percent from $296 million in Q4 2016. Adjusted operating expenses were $269 million, down 9 percent from $296 million in Q4 2016.\n1 Please refer to Table 9 for a reconciliation of these significant items to GAAP. Amounts excluding significant items are non-GAAP financial measures that management believes will assist users of SC's financial information by excluding items that management does not believe reflect SC's fundamental business performance or results of operations.\n2 Includes Finance receivables held for investment, Finance receivables held for sale and Leased vehicles.\n3 Delinquency ratio is defined as the ratio of end of period delinquent principal over 60 days to end of period gross balance of the respective portfolio, excluding capital leases.\n4 Net charge-off ratio stated on a recorded investment basis, which is the unpaid principal balance adjusted for unaccreted net discounts, subvention and origination costs.\n5 Ratio for allowance for credit losses excludes end of period balances on purchased receivables portfolio of $28 million and finance receivables held for sale of $2.2 billion.\n6 The current period losses were primarily driven by $136 million of lower of cost or market adjustments related to the held for sale personal lending portfolio, comprised of $114 million in customer default activity and $23 million increase in market discount, consistent with typical seasonal patterns.\nConference Call Information\nSC will host a conference call and webcast to discuss the Q4 2017 results and other general matters at 9 a.m. Eastern Time on Wednesday, January 31, 2018.

Among the factors that could cause the forward-looking statements in this press release and/or our financial performance to differ materially from that suggested by the forward-looking statements are: (a) the inherent limitations in internal control over financial reporting; (b) our ability to remediate any material weaknesses in internal controls over financial reporting completely and in a timely manner; (c) continually changing federal, state, and local laws and regulations could materially adversely affect our business; (d) adverse economic conditions in the United States and worldwide may negatively impact our results; (e) our business could suffer if our access to funding is reduced; (f) significant risks we face implementing our growth strategy, some of which are outside our control; (g) unexpected costs and delays in connection with exiting our personal lending business; (h) our agreement with Fiat Chrysler Automobiles US LLC may not result in currently anticipated levels of growth and is subject to certain performance conditions that could result in termination of the agreement; (i) our business could suffer if we are unsuccessful in developing and maintaining relationships with automobile dealerships; (j) our financial condition, liquidity, and results of operations depend on the credit performance of our loans; (k) loss of our key management or other personnel, or an inability to attract such management and personnel; (l) certain regulations, including but not limited to oversight by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, the European Central Bank, and the Federal Reserve, whose oversight and regulation may limit certain of our activities, including the timing and amount of dividends and other limitations on our business; and (m) future changes in our relationship with SHUSA and Banco Santander, which could adversely affect our operations.
