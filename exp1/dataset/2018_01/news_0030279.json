The last deepwater round in Mexico in December 2016 saw eight of 10 blocks awarded. \n“You have every ingredient you need for an active sale,” said Tim Duncan, president and chief executive officer of Talos Energy, a U.S. company that won contracts in previous Mexican rounds but is not bidding this time around. UNEXPLORED \nLittle drilling or exploration has been done in Mexico’s deep waters because Pemex lacks the specialist technology needed, as well as the funds. The state energy firm focuses on oilfields in shallow water. \nInternational oil firms are familiar with the geology of the region because it is similar to what is under the Gulf’s U.S. waters. The fields on offer are concentrated in three areas, including the prolific Perdido Fold Belt. \nGlobal oil majors have pumped billions of barrels of crude over decades of operation from the U.S. side, and Mexican waters are thought to hold similarly rich reserves of oil and gas. \nThe auction is the eighth group of fields put on the block since an inaugural Mexico tender in July 2015, which fell flat as crude prices were in the midst of a protracted slide. \nMexico plans another shallow water oil and gas auction in late March, but that is not expected to yield the same scale of investment as the deepwater round. ELECTION RISK \nPena Nieto saw opening up production, exploration and retail of oil and gas as the key to boosting lackluster economic growth to five percent a year or above. \nMore than 2,000 gas stations across Mexico that were once Pemex-only have begun pumping fuel under international brand names, and tens of billions of dollars in investment have been pledged to tap extensive oil and gas reserves. \nHowever, that investment will take years to raise output. Growth is stuck at around 2 percent, and the government has failed to reverse a steady decline in crude production. \nAfter peaking at around 3.4 million barrels per day (bpd) in 2004, oil output is now below 1.9 million bpd - a contrast to solid growth in production in recent years in Brazil, Latin America’s top oil producer. \nBill Richardson, a former U.S. energy secretary, said a successful auction would hand Pena Nieto a political victory as well as lift foreign investment. \n“If this auction is done properly, then it could be a good windfall for Mexico’s energy economy,” he told Reuters. \nPena Nieto is barred by law from seeking a second term, and the possibility of a victory by leftist Lopez Obrador in July’s election has freighted the energy opening with risk. \nThe 64-year-old Lopez Obrador has hinted at a softer stance on the overhaul, encouraging the hope that he would at least not renege on any existing contracts. \nIf oil companies believe Mexico may be less open after July, it could even spur bidding for contracts on Jan. 31, said Duncan at Talos Energy.
