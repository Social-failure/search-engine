He began like the Tiger of old, with a birdie on the first hole, and finished the same way, with an eagle and birdie and the last two, for a final score of two under. \nHe addressed in detail questions about his swing and also spoke at length about the thought process that went into the apparently successful spinal fusion he underwent last April after three failed microdiscectomies. \nAs usual, he said little about his personal life, other than to say his two children were well. He did not address last year’s arrest after he was found asleep at the wheel of his car with multiple prescription drugs in his system. \nBut when it came to his health in general and golf in particular, the 42-year-old could hardly contain his enthusiasm at being pain-free after years of searing pain in his back and legs. \n”My quality of life is infinitely better than it was last year at this point,“ he said. ”I have no more pain in my back. \n”It feels good not to have a burning sensation going down my leg into my foot, or collapse when I‘m walking, things of that nature. \n“It’s been so bad for so long, but turning it around and having my back fused, I haven’t felt this good in years, so I‘m excited about it.” \nWoods has played just one tournament since his spinal fusion, the unofficial Hero World Challenge in the Bahamas in December. \nOf all Woods’ victories, perhaps his greatest came here at the 2008 U.S. Open. He won despite having, in his own words, “no ACL” (anterior cruciate ligament) and a “broken leg” (two stress fractures in his lower left leg). \nBut that was 10 years ago, and he has not won a major championship since. He tees off this week with different expectations. \n”My expectations have tempered a little bit because I haven’t played,“ he said. ”I just want to start playing and getting into a rhythm of playing a schedule again. \n“I haven’t done that in such a long time, so I don’t know what to expect. I‘m going to grind, give it everything I possibly have.” (Reporting by Andrew Both)", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-24T23:06:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-24T23:25:02.012+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
