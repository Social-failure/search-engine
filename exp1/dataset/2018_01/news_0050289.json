Investigators believe there may be more victims or witnesses.\nGymnastics Canada, a national governing body for the sport, said that McFarlane had been banned from coaching gymnastics.\nIt vowed to revise policies on background checks and other areas to better protect athletes.\n”Our hearts go out to the victim in this case, and we want her, and the rest of our community to know that we will not rest until this type of behavior no longer finds a home in the sport of gymnastics,” Gymnastics Canada Chair Richard Crépin said in a statement.\nAn independent investigator is expected to soon launch a probe into how USA Gymnastics and the U.S. Olympic Committee failed to stop Nassar.\nReporting by Anna Mehler Paperny in Toronto; Editing by Jim Finkle\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-30T20:18:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-30T20:36:24.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
