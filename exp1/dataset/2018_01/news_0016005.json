They rose as much as 2.5 percent, as the yellow metal hit a four-month high on a weakening U.S. dollar.\nThe top gainer on Australia’s main index was Evolution Mining Ltd, rising as much as 4.7 percent and posting its biggest intraday percentage gain in nearly five months.\nFinancial stocks climbed as much as 0.5 percent, with the ‘Big Four’ banks adding between 0.3 percent and 0.7 percent.\nNew Zealand’s benchmark S&P/NZX 50 index inched up 0.098 percent, or 8.06 points, to 8,250.41, with utilities, materials and industrial stocks outperforming other sectors.\nMetro Performance Glass Ltd jumped as much as 2.1 percent and was the biggest gainer on the index.
