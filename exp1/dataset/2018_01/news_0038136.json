Ansari said he believed their sexual activity was consensual.\nWhile women are not expected to turn out dressed in black en masse for the SAG awards, as they did at the Jan. 7 Golden Globes, many of the movies and TV shows up for honors have strong female points of view.\nFox Searchlight’s ( FOXA.O ) dark comedy “Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri,” about a furious woman seeking vengeance on male law enforcement officers for the rape and murder of her daughter, has a leading four nods, including the top prize of best cast ensemble.\nA24’s mother-daughter comedy “Lady Bird” has three shots at a SAG statuette: best ensemble and for actresses Saiorse Ronan and Laurie Metcalf.\nNetflix’s World War Two racial drama “Mudbound,” directed and written by a woman, and starring Carey Mulligan and Mary J. Blige, is also in the mix.\nThe SAG awards are indicators of likely Oscar success because actors form the largest group of voters in the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences.\nSAG also hands out awards for television, with “Big Little Lies,” female wrestling drama “Glow,” “The Handmaid’s Tale,” “The Crown” and women’s prison series “Orange is the New Black” all competing.\nRelated Coverage Factbox - Key nominations for the 2018 Screen Actors Guild awards Reporting by Jill Serjeant; Editing by Jonathan Oatis\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-21T13:57:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-21T14:11:41.005+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
