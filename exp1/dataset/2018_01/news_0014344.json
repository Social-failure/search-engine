We need it for our tractors, we need it for our schools, we need it for our home-based businesses,” a White House official told reporters ahead of Trump’s speech at the annual convention of the American Farm Bureau Federation. \n“We’re not moving mountains but we’re certainly getting started,” the official said, speaking on condition of anonymity to preview Trump’s actions. \nThe White House described the moves as an incremental step to help spur private development while the administration figures out what it can do to help with funding, something that could become part of Trump’s plan to invest in infrastructure. \n“We know that funding is really the key thing to actually changing rural broadband,” a second White House official said.
