Kennedy, President and CEO, said, “We had a very strong 2017, as we continued to successfully execute on our strategic plan – Expanding Our Reach. Our earnings and returns for 2017 exceeded our expectations. Earnings per share growth was 27 percent and return on average equity was 10.12 percent for 2017.”\nHighlights for the year included:\nWealth Management is integral to the strategy and diversified revenue sources: Effective November 1, 2017, the Bank acquired Quadrant Capital Management (“Quadrant”), a registered investment advisory firm (“RIA”), based in Fairfield, NJ, which contributed approximately $460 million of assets under management (“AUM”) at the time of acquisition. Effective August 1, 2017, the Bank acquired Murphy Capital Management, LLC(“MCM”), an RIA, based in Gladstone, NJ. MCM contributed approximately $850 million of AUM at the time of acquisition. At December 31, 2017, the market value of AUM/AUA at the Private Wealth Management Division of Peapack-Gladstone Bank (the “Bank”) increased $1.8 billion to $5.5 billion from $3.7 billion at December 31, 2016, reflecting growth of 49 percent. Organic growth was $500 million of the $1.8 billion in growth, while acquisitions accounted for $1.3 billion of the growth. Fee income from the Private Wealth Management Division totaled $23.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, an increase of $4.9 million, or 27 percent from $18.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. Wealth management fee income, comprising approximately 16 percent of the Company’s total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2017, contributed significantly to the Company’s diversified revenue sources. In addition to wealth income, also contributing to the Company’s diversified revenue sources was fee income related to loan level, back-to-back swaps ($2.81 million for 2017 compared to $1.64 million for 2016), and gain on sale of SBA loans ($1.56 million for 2017 compared to $623 thousand for 2016). Total balance sheet growth was managed to just under 10% with a focus on Commercial & Industrial lending: Loans at December 31, 2017 totaled $3.71 billion. This reflected net growth of $392 million, or 12 percent, when compared to the $3.31 billion at December 31, 2016. This loan growth was principally funded by “customer” deposit growth (defined as deposits excluding brokered CDs and brokered “overnight” interest-bearing demand deposits). The Company continued to employ loan sales as a balance sheet management strategy, while improving returns. Multifamily and residential mortgage loan sales for 2017 totaled $109 million, with a net weighted average coupon of 3.30 percent, resulting in a gain of $412 thousand. These loan sales helped fund growth in commercial loans. During the second quarter of 2017, the Company hired a team of very experienced bankers to focus on equipment financing. Net outstanding financings from this business totaled $148 million as of December 31, 2017, and were included in total commercial and industrial (“C&I”) loans. Total C&I loans at December 31, 2017 were $958 million. This reflected net growth of $321 million (50 percent) when compared to $637 million in C&I loans at December 31, 2016. The Company continued to manage its balance sheet such that multifamily loans decline as percent of the overall loan portfolio and C&I loans become a larger percentage of the overall loan portfolio. As of December 31, 2017, total C&I loans comprised 26 percent of the total loan portfolio, as compared to 19 percent a year earlier. As of December 31, 2017, total multifamily loans comprised of 37 percent of the total loan portfolio, as compared to 44 percent a year earlier. The Bank’s concentration in multifamily and investor commercial real estate loans declined to 467 percent of risk based capital at December 31, 2017 from 564 percent at December 31, 2016, and from 695 percent at December 31, 2015. Total “customer” deposit balances (defined as deposits excluding brokered CDs and brokered “overnight” interest-bearing demand deposits) totaled $3.45 billion at December 31, 2017. This reflected net growth of $308 million (10 percent) when compared to $3.14 billion of total “customer” deposit balances at December 31, 2016.\nCapital and asset quality continue to be strong. Asset quality metrics continued to be strong at December 31, 2017. Nonperforming assets at December 31, 2017 were $15.6 million, or 0.37 percent of total assets. Total loans past due 30 through 89 days and still accruing were just $246 thousand, or 0.01 percent of total loans at December 31, 2017. The Company’s and Bank’s capital ratios at December 31, 2017, all increased compared to the December 31, 2016 levels. These capital positions were benefitted by net income of $36.50 million and $36.59 million of voluntary share purchases under the Dividend Reinvestment Plan. Further, during 2017 the Company’s and Bank’s regulatory capital positions were also benefitted by $34.1 million of net proceeds from the mid-December 2017 subordinated debt issuance, and the subsequent downstream of a large portion of the proceeds to the Bank as regulatory capital.\nSupplemental Quarterly Details:\nWealth Management Business\nIn the December 2017 quarter, the Bank’s wealth management business generated $7.49 million in fee income compared to $5.79 million for the September 2017 quarter, and $4.61 million for the December 2016 quarter.\nThe December 2017 quarter included a full three months of income related to MCM, which was acquired effective August 1, 2017, and two months of income related to Quadrant, which was acquired effective November 1, 2017. The December 2017 quarter also included increased “recurring type” fee income (tied principally to asset management fees and custody fees), which was due to net inflows from new business, a healthy equity market which resulted in positive market action in client portfolios as well as additions to accounts from existing clients, all partially offset by normal levels of disbursements and outflows.\nJohn P. Babcock, President of the PGB Private Wealth Management Division, said, “Our differentiator continues to be our personalized, pro-active advice led approach. Our new business pipeline continues to be strong and we expect continued growth organically and through potential strategic acquisitions of wealth management firms.”\nLoans\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2017, the Company continued to employ loan sales as a balance sheet management strategy, while improving returns. The $30 million of residential mortgage loan sales generally funded increases in commercial and industrial loans.\nFor the quarter ended December 31, 2017, commercial and industrial loans grew $113 million (13 percent for the quarter, or 53 percent annualized) to $958 million at year end, compared to $846 million at September 30, 2017.\nMr. Kennedy said, “Our private banking business model of addressing the sophisticated needs and expectations of successful business owners and entrepreneurs is being well received. The ability to engage in high level strategic debt, capital and valuation analysis coupled with succession, estate and wealth planning strategies, enables us to provide a unique boutique level of service to business owners and middle market clients.”\nFunding\nIn mid-December 2017, the Company issued $35 million of subordinated debt ($34.1 million net of underwriting fees and expenses) bearing interest at an annual rate of 4.75 percent for the first five years, and thereafter at an adjustable rate until maturity in December 2027 or earlier redemption.\nDuring the December 2017 quarter, customer deposit growth of $47 million, net (principally interest-bearing checking, money market and retail certificates of deposit), $24 million of capital growth, $34 million of net proceeds from the subordinated debt issuance, and $30 million of loan sales, funded loan growth, increased liquidity (investments and interest-bearing cash) of $33 million, and maturities of wholesale borrowings of $12 million and brokered certificates of deposit of $11 million.\nMr. Kennedy noted, “The Company will continue to focus on providing high touch client service, a key element in growing its personal and commercial core deposit base. We expect that our full array of treasury management capabilities, including our new Treasury Management platform and our new escrow management product software, as well as added treasury management sales professionals and private bankers, will help us grow commercial deposits.”\nMr. Kennedy added, “Our overall balance sheet growth will be governed by our continued ability to generate value-added core deposits. We will be intently focused on fully utilizing our enhanced in-house relationship-based loan profitability model to manage the origination of loans with competitive risk-adjusted returns.”\nNet Interest Income / Net Interest Margin\nNet interest income and net interest margin were $28.59 million and 2.78 percent for the fourth quarter of 2017, compared to $29.99 million and 2.95 percent for the third quarter of 2017, and compared to $24.58 million and 2.63 percent for the same quarter last year. Net interest income for the fourth quarter of 2017 benefitted from loan growth as well as $945 thousand of prepayment premiums received on the prepayment of multifamily loans, which reflected a decrease from $1.3 million for the September 2017 quarter and an increase from $464 thousand in the December 2016 quarter. The September 2017 quarter also benefitted from $1.2 million of recognition of deferred fees and prepayment premiums on two C&I credits.\nNet interest margin for the fourth quarter of 2017 decreased when compared to the third quarter of 2017, and increased from the same quarter of 2016. The increase from the same quarter of 2016 was due to the increased prepayment premiums noted above, as well as the effect of the increased market rates on our adjustable rate assets, partially offset by an increase in our cost of deposits. The decrease from the previous quarter was due to the lower prepayment premiums and the September quarter’s recognition of the deferred fees mentioned above. The issuance of $35 million of subordinated debt issued in mid-December 2017 also negatively impacted net interest margin slightly.\nNet interest margin is also affected by the maintenance of liquid assets on the Company’s balance sheet. In addition to approximately $441 million of cash, cash equivalents and investment securities on its balance sheet, the Company also had approximately $1.3 billion of secured funding available from the Federal Home Loan Bank, of which only $38 million was drawn as of December 31, 2017.\nThe Company’s interest rate sensitivity models indicate that the Company’s net interest income and margin would improve slightly in a rising interest rate environment. However, the Company noted, such income and margin may also be impacted by competitive pressures in attracting and/or retaining deposits.\nOther Noninterest Income\nThe fourth quarter of 2017 included $774 thousand of income related to the Company’s SBA lending and sale program, compared to $493 thousand generated in the September 2017 quarter, and $121 thousand in the December 2016 quarter.\nThe fourth quarter of 2017 also included $179 thousand of loan level, back-to-back swap income compared to $888 thousand in the September 2017 quarter and $874 thousand in the December 2016 quarter. This program provides a borrower with a fixed interest rate on a loan, while providing an adjustable rate to the Company, thus helping to manage the Company’s interest rate risk, while contributing to income.\nOperating Expenses\nThe Company’s total operating expenses were $24.25 million for the quarter ended December 31, 2017, compared to $21.96 million for the September 2017 quarter and $18.97 million for the December 2016 quarter.\nCompensation and employee benefits expense for the December 2017 quarter was $15.30 million compared to $14.00 million for the September 2017 quarter, and $11.48 million for the December 2016 quarter. The December 2017 quarter included a full quarter of expense related to the Equipment Finance team (who joined in April 2017) and MCM (which closed in August 2017) and two months of expense related to Quadrant (which closed in November 2017). Additionally, the Company recorded expense of $1.3 million related to the separation of two senior officers. Strategic hiring, normal salary increases and increased bonus/incentive accruals associated with the Company’s growth also contributed to the increase for the December 2017 quarter compared to the 2016 quarter.\nOther expenses for the December 2017 quarter were $5.27 million compared to $4.44 million for the September 2017 quarter and $3.78 million for the December 2016 quarter. The December 2017 quarter included approximately $300 thousand of investment banking fee expenses related to the Quadrant acquisition, a full quarter of other expenses related to the Equipment Finance business and MCM, and two months of other operating expenses related to Quadrant. Further, when compared to the December 2016 quarter, the December 2017 quarter included increased advertising and marketing expenses relating to various target marketing campaigns. The September 2017 quarter included approximately $360 thousand of investment banking fee expenses related to the MCM acquisition.\nIncome Taxes\nThe December 2017 quarter included a $1.60 million tax benefit from the reduction of the Company’s deferred tax liability due to the new tax law. The December 2017 quarter taxes also benefitted from the vesting of restricted stock at market prices above initial grant prices.\nProvision for Loan and Lease Losses / Asset Quality\nFor the quarter ended December 31, 2017, the Company’s provision for loan and lease losses was $1.65 million, compared to $400 thousand for the September 2017 quarter and $1.50 million for the December 2016 quarter. The Company’s provision for loan and lease losses (and its allowance for loan and lease losses) reflect, among other things, the Company’s asset quality metrics and net loan growth.\nAt December 31, 2017, the allowance for loan and lease losses of $36.44 million (269 percent of nonperforming loans and 0.98 percent of total loans), compared to $35.92 million at September 30, 2017 (234 percent of nonperforming loans and 0.98 percent of total loans), and $32.21 million (286 percent of nonperforming loans and 0.97 percent of total loans) at December 31, 2016.\nNonperforming assets at December 31, 2017 (which does not include troubled debt restructured loans that are performing in accordance with their terms) were $15.6 million, or 0.37 percent of total assets, compared to $15.5 million, or 0.37 percent of total assets, at September 30, 2017 and $11.8 million, or 0.30 percent of total assets, at December 31, 2016. Total loans past due 30 through 89 days and still accruing were $246 thousand at December 31, 2017, compared to $589 thousand at September 30, 2017 and $1.4 million at December 31, 2016.\nCapital / Dividends\nThe Company’s and Bank’s capital positions in the December 2017 quarter were benefitted by net income of $10.37 million and $10.51 million of voluntary share purchases under the Dividend Reinvestment Plan, which continues to be a source of capital for the Company. The Company’s and Bank’s regulatory capital positions were also benefitted by the mid-December 2017 subordinated debt issuance, and subsequent downstream of a large portion of the proceeds to the Bank as regulatory capital.\nThe Bank’s regulatory capital ratios are all above the ratios to be considered well capitalized under regulatory guidance.\nOn January 25, 2018, the Company’s Board of Directors declared a regular cash dividend of $0.05 per share payable on February 23, 2018 to shareholders of record on February 8, 2018.\nABOUT THE COMPANY\nPeapack-Gladstone Financial Corporation is a New Jersey bank holding company with total assets of $4.26 billion as of December 31, 2017.

PEAPACK-GLADSTONE FINANCIAL CORPORATION\nNON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES RECONCILIATION\nTangible book value per share and tangible equity as a percentage of tangible assets at period end are non-GAAP financial measures derived from GAAP-based amounts. We calculate tangible equity and tangible assets by excluding the balance of intangible assets from shareholders’ equity and total assets, respectively. We calculate tangible book value per share by dividing tangible equity by period end common shares outstanding, as compared to book value per common share, which we calculate by dividing shareholders’ equity by period end common shares outstanding. We calculate tangible equity as a percentage of tangible assets at period end by dividing tangible equity by tangible assets at period end. We believe that this is consistent with the treatment by bank regulatory agencies, which exclude intangible assets from the calculation of risk-based capital ratios.\nThe efficiency ratio is a non-GAAP measure of expense control relative to recurring revenue. We calculate the efficiency ratio by dividing total noninterest expenses, excluding ORE provision, as determined under GAAP, by net interest income and total noninterest income as determined under GAAP, but excluding net gains/(losses) on loans held for sale at lower of cost or fair value and excluding net gains on securities from this calculation, which we refer to below as recurring revenue. We believe that this provides one reasonable measure of core expenses relative to core revenue.\nWe believe that these non-GAAP financial measures provide information that is important to investors and that is useful in understanding our financial position, results and ratios. Our management internally assesses our performance based, in part, on these measures. However, these non-GAAP financial measures are supplemental and are not a substitute for an analysis based on GAAP measures. As other companies may use different calculations for these measures, this presentation may not be comparable to other similarly titles measures reported by other companies. A reconciliation of the non-GAAP measures of tangible common equity, tangible book value per share and efficiency ratio to the underlying GAAP numbers is set forth below.\nNon-GAAP Financial Reconciliation\n(Dollars in thousands, except share data)\nThree Months Ended Dec 31, Sept 30, June 30, March 31, Dec 31, Tangible Book Value Per Share 2017 2017 2017 2017 2016 Shareholders’ equity $ 403,678 $ 379,936 $ 356,847 $ 340,928 $ 324,210 Less: Intangible assets, net 23,836 15,064 3,095 3,126 3,157 Tangible equity 379,842 364,872 353,752 337,802 321,053 Period end shares outstanding 18,619,634 18,214,759 17,846,404 17,579,274 17,257,995 Tangible book value per share $ 20.40 $ 20.03 $ 19.82 $ 19.22 $ 18.60 Book value per share 21.68 20.86 20.00 19.39 18.79 Tangible Equity to Tangible Assets Total assets $ 4,260,547 $ 4,176,332 $ 4,165,679 $ 3,947,562 $ 3,878,633 Less: Intangible assets, net 23,836 15,064 3,095 3,126 3,157 Tangible assets 4,236,711 4,161,268 4,162,584 3,944,436 3,875,476 Tangible equity to tangible assets 8.97 % 8.77 % 8.50 % 8.56 % 8.28 % Equity to assets 9.47 % 9.10 % 8.57 % 8.64 % 8.36 %\nThree Months Ended Dec 31, Sept 30, June 30, March 31, Dec 31, Efficiency Ratio 2017 2017 2017 2017 2016 Net interest income $ 28,586 $ 29,992 $ 26,972 $ 25,591 $ 24,580 Total other income 10,606 8,831 8,171 7,019 7,672 Less: Gain on loans held for sale\nat lower of cost or fair value 378 34 - - 353 Less: Securities gains, net - - - - - Total recurring revenue 38,814 38,789 35,143 32,610 31,899 Operating expenses 24,251 21,961 20,095 19,304 18,965 Total operating expense 24,251 21,961 20,095 19,304 18,965 Efficiency ratio 62.48 % 56.62 % 57.18 % 59.20 % 59.45 %\nTwelve Months Ended Dec 31, Dec 31, Efficiency Ratio 2017 2016 Net interest income $ 111,141 $ 96,435 Total other income 34,627 28,918 Less: Gain on loans held for sale\nat lower of cost or fair value 412 1,233 Less: Securities gains, net - 119 Total recurring revenue 145,356 124,001 Operating expenses 85,611 75,112 Total operating expense 85,611 75,112 Efficiency ratio 58.90 % 60.57 %\nContact:\nJeffrey J.
