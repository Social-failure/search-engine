I think that it was just little bit difficult to adjust, especially the beginning of the match. \n“With the roof closed, it was way, way cooler than I expected. That was very, very difficult, especially for the final to be in that kind of a situation.” \nThe retractable roofs of the main showcourts at Melbourne Park are usually kept open unless the tournament’s extreme heat policy is invoked when the temperature exceeds 40 degrees Celsius (104 F) and a key humidity threshold has been surpassed. \nTournament organisers cited the ‘wet bulb globe temperature’, its humidity measure, as being above the threshold of 32.5 as their reason for the roof closure. \nThe temperature outside, however, was 37 degrees Celsius (98.6 F) when Cilic and Federer walked out on court.

REUTERS/Edgar Su \nThe roof closure triggered a barrage of criticism from current and former players, with former Wimbledon champion Pat Cash saying it played right into 36-year-old Federer’s hands. \n“It’s an outdoor tournament -- it’s like Wimbledon. Why is the roof closed?” the Australian said during commentary for BBC radio. \n“The way Roger plays, he swings so hard at the ball and takes it so early, any wind or variation of the ball moving will take it away from him. It’s why he’s one of the best players ever indoors.” \nOther players expressed similar disdain.

GS are outdoor events. Yes it’s hot but the court is under shade and an evening match,” tweeted British former U.S. Open finalist Greg Rusedski. \nDuring the first week of the grand slam, players battled through two days of searing 40-degree heat fully exposed to the elements, as organisers declined to invoke the heat policy. \nA number of players criticised the policy, saying it had placed their health at risk. \nFederer, who claimed his sixth Australian Open title and 20th in grand slams, said he was “surprised” organisers had the heat rule in place for the night final. \n“I never heard that before,” he said. \n”Of course, I backed myself in, sort of, indoor conditions. \n“I do think back that usually when I play indoors, it’s good for me. But I didn’t mind the heat, to be honest.” Editing by Amlan Chakraborty and Pritha Sarkar", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-28T11:26:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-28T11:53:14.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
