Hopefully, we might be able to get him registered in time to play in the cup,” Allardyce told a news conference on Thursday. \n“There is a medical and all sorts to go through so that might be very tight. Securing the player is the most important thing obviously because it has been the club’s biggest area of concern.” \nEverton are ninth in the league after recovering from a poor start to the season but have been toothless in attack, scoring just 25 goals in 22 league games.

It’s a glory game and you try and win it. A draw is not good enough.” \nEverton drew 1-1 with Liverpool at Anfield in last month’s league fixture.
