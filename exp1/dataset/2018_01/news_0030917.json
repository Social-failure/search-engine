All she needs now is some wheels. \nPatrick, the first and only woman to win an IndyCar race, has reunited with GoDaddy, the internet domain name company that previously sponsored her until 2015. \n“We’re getting the band back together,” GoDaddy chief marketing officer Barb Rechterman said in a statement. \nPatrick welcomed the news. \n“This is definitely the way I want to finish my racing career - at these two iconic races, backed by my iconic, long-time sponsor,” said the 35-year-old Patrick who won the 2008 Indy Japan 300. \nShe also came third in the 2009 Indianapolis 500 in the open wheel series before transitioning full-time to stock car racing on the NASCAR circuit, where she notched seven top-10 finishes. \nPatrick has been without a drive since parting ways with Stewart-Haas Racing late last year. \n“Sponsorship plays a vital role in our sport, and I have been very fortunate over the course of my career, but this year threw us for a curve,” Patrick said in September. \nHer new arrangement should help her quest to find a car to drive at Daytona on Feb. 18 and Indianapolis on May 27.
