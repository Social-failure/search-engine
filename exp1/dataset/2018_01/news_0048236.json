While it enjoys good growth in its diabetes and obesity business, which accounts for around 80 percent of sales, the biopharmaceuticals division, which makes up nearly 20 percent of revenue led by hemophilia, is slowing.\nIt stands to lose sales particularly because of new competition from Roche’s hemophilia drug Hemlibra.\n“We remain focused on identifying additional assets in the hemophilia and hematology space that we can bolt on to our existing franchise,” Brandgaard said.\n“We believe those assets are available but whether it is going to be in the form of in-licensing of Phase II or Phase III clinical stage assets or whether it is going to be outright M&A, that depends.”\nNovo Nordisk is showing a new eagerness to engage in acquisitions under Chief Executive Lars Fruergaard Jorgensen, who took over a year ago, and who has said the firm needs external innovation to broaden its product line-up.\nIt has the firepower to do deals, with strong cash flows and a cash pile of 19 billion Danish crowns at the end of September 2017, although analysts believe it might have to trim share buybacks in 2018 in the event of a substantial purchase.\nSo far the Danish company has failed to successfully execute a big deal.\nIn addition to losing Ablynx, in March 2017 it also approached Global Blood Therapeutics, a U.S. biotech company focused on serious blood disorders, to discuss a potential takeover, people familiar with the situation said at the time.\nBrandgaard said Novo Nordisk had not made a formal attempt to buy Global Blood Therapeutics and described reports of its interest in the U.S. firm as a market rumor.\nReporting by Ben Hirschler; Editing by Alison Williams\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-01-29T20:53:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-29T15:05:25.003+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
