Its 2017 revenue is expected to grow to 1.2-1.25 billion euros ($1.5-$1.6 billion) from 1.88 billion in 2016.\nReporting by Gilles Guillaume and Dominique Vidalon; Editing by Sudip Kar-Gupta\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-01-26T17:16:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-26T11:49:41.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
