In a response to Elliott, David Granot said he shared the view that proper corporate governance is of prime importance to Bezeq.\nGranot said he intends to take Elliott’s concerns into serious consideration when a slate of board candidates for election is proposed at its next annual meeting.\n“I expect that this slate will contain changes in the composition of our board,” Granot added.
