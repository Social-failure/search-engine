The search vessel, the Seabed Constructor, set off from Durban, South Africa, on Jan. 3.\nReuters reported earlier on Tuesday that the Seabed Constructor had reached the remote spot in the Indian Ocean where Australian scientists believe the plane went down.\nAustralia, Malaysia and China called off their two-year search for the plane a year ago after finding nothing in a 120,000-sq-km underwater search zone.
