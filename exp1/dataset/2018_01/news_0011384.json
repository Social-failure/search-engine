His comments roiled the market and subsequently the justice ministry and other sections of South Korea's government have softened their stance.\nOn Tuesday, Reuters further reported that a senior Chinese central banker said authorities should ban centralized trading of virtual currencies as well as individuals and businesses that provide related services.\n\"The entire market cap of cryptocurrencies saw a sell-off post the comments on crypto from the vice governor of the PBOC,\" Fernando Martinez, VP trader at Hong Kong-based commodities and digital assets trading house Octagon Strategy, told CNBC.\nThat, according to Martinez, was on top of the \"additional negative sentiments from South Korea stating that tighter crypto-controls are still a possibility.\"\nBitcoin was down 11.43 percent over the last day — at $10,308 — at 11:55 a.m. London time on Coinbase\nCoinbase is the leading U.S. marketplace for trading bitcoin, ethereum, litecoin and bitcoin cash.\nLate Tuesday afternoon, bitcoin briefly dropped below $10,000 on Coinbase, after first topping the psychologically key level in late November.
