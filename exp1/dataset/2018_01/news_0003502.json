He has been associated with the New York City Ballet for more than 40 years—first as a dancer, then as an artistic leader. \nMartins has also served as artistic director of the School of American Ballet. He is similarly retiring from his role at the school. \nIn his letter of resignation to the boards of both the company and the school, Martins said he denies that he “engaged in any such misconduct,” but that he wanted to “bring an end to this disruption which has enveloped the Ballet and the School.” ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-02T15:55:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-02T16:00:33.001+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
