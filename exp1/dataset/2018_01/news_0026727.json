I hope they listen and I hope they don’t make any of the girls go back to the ranch. No one should have to go back there after so many of us were abused there,” she said.\nThe complex, opened by celebrated coaches Bela and Martha Karolyi in the mid 1980s, played a vital role in making the U.S. women’s team a dominant force in global competitions.\nLocated in the Sam Houston Forest, the facility includes training gyms, a dance studio, housing for 300 athletes, coaches and administrators and a dining hall.\nIt has been the home of several Olympic and world champions and was the designated Olympic training site for the USA Gymnastics National Team.\n“It has been my intent to terminate this agreement since I began as president and CEO in December,” USA Gymnastics president and chief executive Kerry Perry said.\n“Our most important priority is our athletes, and their training environment must reflect this. We are committed to a culture that empowers and supports our athletes.”\nReporting by Frank Pingue in Toronto, editing by Ed Osmond\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-19T00:14:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-19T00:32:38.024+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
