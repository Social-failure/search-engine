Premiums are considered high-burden if they exceed 9.5 percent of income. \nWhile high-burden out-of-pocket spending dropped 20 percent across all income groups, middle-income households saw a 28 percent jump in high-burden premium spending, the study found. \n\"Our findings suggest that the Affordable Care Act reduced out-of-pocket costs for many Americans,\" said the report's lead author, Dr. Anna Goldman, a primary care doctor at Cambridge Health Alliance and fellow at Harvard Medical School. \n\"But the ACA didn't stem the steady rise in families' premiums. Overall, the law helped ease families' medical cost burden, but there is plenty of room for progress.\" \nThe study, which examined spending data from more than 83,000 adults, looked at changes in health-related expenditures in 2014 and 2015. \nThose were the first years in which health coverage from private individual Obamacare plans was available from government-run marketplaces, and in which health plans were mandated by the ACA to cover preventative services and contraception without imposing out-of-pocket charges on patients. \nThat period also saw the continued expansion of Medicaid benefits to more poor adults in an increasing number of states under the ACA. As of now, all but 18 states have expanded benefits under Obamacare. \n\"The ACA's Medicaid expansion, which generally required enrollees to pay neither premiums nor co-payments, likely accounts for our finding that out-of-pocket spending decreased among the lowest-income group after the law's implementation,\" the report said.
