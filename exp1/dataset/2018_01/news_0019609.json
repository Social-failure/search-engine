Gross domestic product expanded 6.7 percent in 2016.\nThe main reason why China performed well last year was because it refrained from “flooding” the economy with stimulus while pushing ahead with supply-side reforms and cultivating new sources of momentum, Li said.\nThe official 2017 GDP data is due to be published on Jan. 18.\nChina’s foreign exchange reserves continued to rise last year, while the country’s corporate leverage ratio declined at a steady pace, Li also said, according to Xinhua.\nReporting by Ryan Woo; Editing by Shri Navaratnam\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-01-11T09:31:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-11T03:44:59.004+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
