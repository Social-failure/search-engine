Bullish/very bullish sentiment rose from 55 percent in the previous quarter to 76 percent this quarter, suggesting that even with recent market highs, investors still see room at the top for continued growth. Further, investors remain largely positive about upcoming FAANG (Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Netflix, Google) earnings, with investors showing particular confidence in Amazon's results exceeding street expectations.\nThe results of the in-house survey, conducted January 4-9, 2018 by Ally Invest, are based on responses from 385+ independent investors.\nBull - Bear Sentiment\nThe quarterly survey showed 61% of investors have a bullish market outlook (vs. 49% last quarter) and 15% are very bullish (vs. 6% last quarter), with just 3% of investors reporting a bearish or very bearish view (down from 12% the last quarter). Investors point to corporate earnings (71% of respondents) and accelerating growth (44%) as particular market drivers. However, investors continue to keep a close eye on potential market concerns, including somewhat lessened concerns about international unrest (42% this quarter vs. 54% last quarter), with concerns about slowing year-over-year growth and weakening of the U.S. dollar tied at 17% of respondents.\nOptimistic Outlook for FAANG Earnings\nWhen asked \"What is your outlook for each of the 'FAANG' stocks for the fourth quarter?,\" the majority of investors believe again this quarter these companies will either meet or exceed street expectations with bullish sentiment the strongest on Amazon and the weakest on Apple and Netflix. Here is how response for the FAANG stocks compared:\nFacebook (meet street expectations: 31%, exceed street expectations 29%) Amazon (meet street expectations: 19%, exceed street expectations: 41%) Apple (meet street expectations: 35%, exceed street expectations: 27%) Netflix (meet street expectations: 33%, exceed street expectations: 27%) Google (meet street expectations: 28%, exceed street expectations: 38%)\nInvestors Watching a Variety of Trade Triggers for FAANG Stocks\nWhen asked, \"Which trade triggers are you watching most closely for each of the 'FAANG' stocks?,\" investors offered a range of responses, though ongoing annual revenue growth was among the top three triggers cited by all investors surveyed.\nFacebook: The social network's advertising revenue was cited as the top investor response (19%), followed by year-over-year revenue growth (12%) and year-over-year EPS growth and the number of active users/subscribers tied for third (11%). Amazon: Investors likewise pointed to year-over-year revenue growth as the top trade trigger (28%), followed by year-over-year EPS growth (12%) and gross margins (7%). Apple: Apple's enduring reputation for innovative consumer products continues to be its calling card, with investors pointing to new product launch(es) as a top trade trigger (18%), followed by product sales by category (16%) and year-over-year revenue growth (12%). Netflix: The number of active users/subscribers was Netflix's top trade trigger (29%), followed by year-over-year revenue growth (10%) and year-over-year EPS growth (9%).
