The robust strength in MDI Urethanes was somewhat offset by a weaker than expected quarter in its Performance Products division partially due to unplanned outages and weather related issues in the Gulf Coast region, which have since been fully resolved. Performance Products EBITDA is now expected to be down versus the prior year pro forma EBITDA of $61 million, adjusted for the sale of its European surfactants business. For the fourth quarter 2017 Huntsman Corporation expects to report total adjusted EBITDA modestly above the third quarter 2017 adjusted EBITDA of $340 million.\nHuntsman will hold a conference call to discuss its fourth quarter 2017 financial results on Friday, February 23, 2018 at 10:00 a.m. ET.
