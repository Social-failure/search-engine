This increase reflected growth not seen in almost two decades, and drove the average filing rate to more than one per day. Once again, growth was dominated by a record number of federal merger-objection filings, with 197 such filings. In addition, there was a record rate of case resolution, which was driven by increases of more than 40% in dismissals and 30% in settlements. Despite this, the aggregate value of settlements plunged to a level not seen since the early 2000s, stemming from a dearth of large settlements,” said NERA Managing Director Dr. David Tabak .\n“I am especially excited to share this year’s report, as it marks the 25th anniversary edition. My NERA colleagues and I are proud to reflect back on the numerous NERA authors and experts who contributed to our reports’ success and impact over the past two and a half decades. The longevity of this series underscores NERA’s commitment to offering sound advice in the economics of securities, finance, and commerce.”\nHighlighted Trends\nA total of 353 securities class actions were resolved in 2017—a post-PSLRA high. Of those, 148 cases settled, coming close to the 2007 record of 150. The average settlement in 2017 fell to less than $25 million, a drop of roughly two-thirds compared to 2016. Aggregate NERA-defined Investor Losses for filings were $334 billion in 2017, a 50% increase over the five-year average. Aggregate plaintiffs’ attorneys’ fees and expenses were $467 million, a drop of roughly 65% to a level not seen since 2004. In 2017, the number pending cases in the federal system increased to 785, up by 12% from 2016 and 41% from 2011.\nNERA Securities Class Action Trends Report Series\nNERA has been analyzing trends in securities class actions for more than 25 years.
