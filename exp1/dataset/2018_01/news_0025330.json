He said he took seriously concern in the SPD about another “grand coalition” but added: “I‘m actually optimistic that we’ll get a majority for it.”\nMany of the SPD’s grassroots supporters say the coalition blueprint agreed between the SPD and Merkel’s CDU/CSU alliance last week reflects too few of their aims and the party should reinvent itself in opposition.\nOn Saturday, youth activists rallied the SPD in the eastern state of Saxony-Anhalt into rejecting a “grand coalition” and on Monday the SPD’s Berlin branch recommended its delegates vote against pursuing formal coalition talks..\nIn remarks seemingly intended to appease opponents of the blueprint in North Rhine-Westphalia, its conservative state premier Armin Laschet said on Monday it would be further refined.\nBut that concession seems unlikely to win over SPD activists in the state, who say the preliminary agreement makes too many concessions, containing no pledges to raise taxes on top earners or abolish Germany’s dual public-private health insurance system in favour of a single “citizen’s insurance”.\nIf Schulz fails to persuade them, the talks could collapse, deepening the mood of political uncertainty that has gripped Europe’s largest economy and key power-broker since an earlier attempt by Merkel to form a three-way coalition with two smaller parties collapsed in November.\nSchulz defended the draft, telling the RND newspaper network in an extract from an interview to be published on Tuesday: “We pushed through a long list of points which will really improve people’s lives.” While the party had not got everything it wanted, “what we did push through justifies starting coalition negotiations.”\nHis sentiments were echoed by SPD parliamentary leader Andrea Nahles, who told Passauer Neue Presse newspaper the party had scored points on nursing care, pensions, education and labour market policy.\nMartin Schulz, Germany's Social Democratic Party (SPD) leader, and Andrea Nahles of SPD give a statement as they meet with local SPD members in Dortmund, Germany, January 15, 2018. REUTERS/Wolfgang Rattay “We should stop badmouthing the result,” she said.\n“ENDLESS NEGOTIATION”\nIn inconclusive national elections in September, the conservatives lost votes to the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) party.\nBut the SPD performed even worse, notching up its worst result since the foundation of the Federal Republic in 1949. Opponents of the deal within the party say it would suffer even bigger losses in the next national election if it renewed the coalition.\nSlideshow (3 Images) As a sweetener, senior SPD member Wolfgang Tiefensee suggested the party could demand a clause in any final coalition agreement that committed Merkel to calling a vote of confidence two years into the next government’s four-year term.\n“Should everything work fine we will continue,” said Tiefensee, economy minister in the state of Thuringia. “If not, there will be a new election.”\nJackson Janes, president of the American Institute for Contemporary German Studies in Washington, said he expected the SPD party congress to approve the start of coalition talks despite the resistance by the youth wing of the party.\n“There’s too much at stake,” he said. “Nearly everyone ...at the top of the party is supporting this. The heavies are working this fairly strongly.”\nEven if SPD delegates approve formal talks, a fourth term for Merkel is not guaranteed, and Schulz has promised to put the terms of any deal to a vote by the 443,000 SPD members.\nIn trying to sell it, he can point to lower taxes for low-income households that traditionally formed the backbone of the party’s support base.\nBut any softening of conditions is likely to meet opposition from the Christian Social Union (CSU), the arch-conservative Bavarian sister party of Merkel’s Christian Democrats (CDU).\n“I can’t imagine that we will substantially change the agreement reached in exploratory talks,” said CSU leader Horst Seehofer, dismissing the demands of a “worked-up” SPD.\nAdditional reporting by Joern Poltz in Munich, Andrea Shalal and Michelle Martin in Berlin and Reuters Television in Dortmund; editing by John Stonestreet\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-15T12:35:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-15T12:48:32.008+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
