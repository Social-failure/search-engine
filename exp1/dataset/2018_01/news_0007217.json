In northern Shanxi province, greenhouses for vegetables collapsed under the weight of snow, footage on state television showed on Sunday.\n“More than 45,000 acres of fruit trees, tea farms as well as greenhouses for vegetable have been damaged by freezing rains and snow,” the Ministry of Agriculture said, adding that wheat planting could be delayed due to the cold weather.\nThe city of Hefei, the capital of Anhui province, will give residents discounts on vegetables for seven days after prices increased, state radio said on Sunday, citing the city’s pricing regulator.\nState radio said prices of vegetables like cabbages and lettuce more than doubled in the past week in eastern Anhui province due to transport curbs and damage to crops.\nChina warned of a second wave of snow and sleet hitting northern, central and eastern parts on Friday after record snowfall paralysed parts of the country in the most severe weather this winter.\nReporting by Meng Meng and Josephine Mason; Editing by Susan Fenton\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-07T13:57:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-07T14:19:27.024+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
