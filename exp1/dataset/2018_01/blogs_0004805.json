Waves on top of the high water levels will likely damage vulnerable decks, stairs, and docks near the water line. Vulnerable homes and businesses along the water may sustain damage.” \nFlooding was reported in multiple towns and cities along the Massachusetts coast, including Scituate, Plum Island, Quincy, Plymouth, Chatham, and Duxbury. In Boston, the high tide record of 15.1 feet, which was set during the blizzard of 1978, was tied on Thursday at 12:40 p.m. in the afternoon, according to NBC 4 Washington . \nBoston Mayor Martin J. Walsh declared a snow emergency and parking ban, and encouraged residents to stay off the road. Boston schools will be closed on Friday, Jan. 5. SNOW ON THE WAY: A Snow Emergency & Parking Ban will go into effect for #Boston at 7 a.m. Thursday.
