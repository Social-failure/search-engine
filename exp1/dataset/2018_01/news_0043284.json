However, as a result of the previously announced write-down of deferred tax assets, which resulted in an additional tax expense of $42.6 million, or $1.30 per diluted share, Banner reported a net loss in the fourth quarter of 2017 of $13.5 million, or $0.41 per diluted share. This compares to net income of $25.1 million, or $0.76 per diluted share, in the preceding quarter and net income of $22.8 million, or $0.69 per diluted share, in the fourth quarter a year ago. For the year ended December 31, 2017, net income was $60.8 million, or $1.84 per diluted share, compared to $85.4 million, or $2.52 per diluted share, in 2016. There were no acquisition-related costs in 2017, compared to $11.7 million in acquisition-related expenses in 2016.\n“Our fourth quarter results were significantly impacted by the write-down of deferred tax assets following passage of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act on December 22, 2017. Results were also significantly impacted by the sale of our Utah operations which generated a substantial gain on sale of $12.2 million. In addition, securities sales in connection with our balance sheet restructuring designed to postpone the adverse impact of the Durbin Amendment on debit card interchange fees produced a $2.3 million net loss on the sale of securities,” stated Mark J. Grescovich, President and Chief Executive Officer. “Aside from those one-time events, our core operations remain solid, with strong net interest income and other revenues contributing to record pre-tax earnings for the year. We continue to invest in infrastructure to augment our risk management operations to meet the additional regulatory requirements as we plan for growth beyond the $10 billion benchmark. While making those necessary investments we remain focused on delivering revenue growth, sustainable profitability and increasing value to our shareholders while still maintaining our moderate risk profile. Through the hard work of our dedicated employees throughout 2017 we continued to advance these goals.\"\nOn October 6, 2017, Banner Bank completed the sale of its seven branches and related assets and liabilities in Utah to People’s Intermountain Bank, a banking subsidiary of People’s Utah Bancorp (NASDAQ:PUB). Under the terms of the purchase and assumption agreement, the sale included approximately $255 million in loans and $160 million in deposits. In addition, on January 4, 2018, Banner announced that as a result of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, it was required to revalue its deferred tax assets and liabilities to account for the future impact of lower corporate tax rates and other provisions of the legislation. Banner recorded a one-time net tax charge during the fourth quarter of $42.6 million, or $1.30 per share, related to the revaluation of these deferred tax items. This increase in income tax expense was reflected in operating results for the fourth quarter of 2017 and was in addition to the normal provision for income tax related to pre-tax net operating income.\nIn addition, during the fourth quarter Banner implemented a number of strategic balance sheet initiatives designed to keep its assets below $10 billion at December 31, 2017 in order to postpone the adverse impact of the Durbin Amendment to the Dodd-Frank Act regarding limits on, among other things, debit card interchange fees. As previously disclosed, Banner estimates that the Durbin Amendment will have a $12 million annualized negative impact on pre-tax revenues commencing six months after the calendar year end when it exceeds $10 billion in assets. In December of 2017, Banner sold approximately $470 million of investment securities in the available for sale portfolio, using the proceeds to fund loans and to pay down certain wholesale borrowings and maturing brokered deposits. Banner incurred pre-tax net losses of $2.3 million in connection with the sale of these investment securities, which will produce tax benefits based upon the 2017 marginal federal income tax rate of 35%. To the extent that the Company re-leverages its balance sheet in future periods, the net interest income on replacement securities will be subject to the new 21% marginal corporate federal income tax rate. In recent periods Banner has incurred a blended effective federal and state tax rate of 33% to 34%. As a result of the reduced marginal federal tax rate, Banner anticipates that its blended effective federal and state tax rate will be approximately 22% to 23% in 2018.\nAt December 31, 2017, Banner Corporation had $9.76 billion in assets, $7.51 billion in net loans and $8.18 billion in deposits. Banner operates 178 branch offices located in eight of the top 20 largest western Metropolitan Statistical Areas by population.\nFourth Quarter 2017 Highlights\nTotal assets at December 31, 2017 were $9.76 billion, postponing the adverse effects of the Durbin Amendment. Completed sale of Banner Bank's seven Utah branches generating a gain on sale of $12.2 million. Revenues were $128.1 million during the quarter ended December 31, 2017, $120.5 million during the preceding quarter and $116.6 million during the fourth quarter last year. Revenues from core operations* were $119.3 million, compared to $120.8 million in the preceding quarter, and increased 2% compared to $117.5 million in the fourth quarter a year ago. Net interest margin was 4.18% for the current quarter, compared to 4.22% in the preceding quarter and 4.32% in the fourth quarter a year ago. Deposit fees and other service charges were $13.0 million, compared to $13.3 million in the preceding quarter and a 7% increase compared to $12.2 million in the fourth quarter a year ago. Provision for loan losses was $2.0 million, bringing the allowance for loan losses to $89.0 million or 1.17% of total loans. Net loans receivable were $7.51 billion at December 31, 2017, compared to $7.69 billion at September 30, 2017, and increased 2% compared to $7.37 billion a year ago. Core deposits increased 2% compared to December 31, 2016 and represented 88% of total deposits at December 31, 2017. Quarterly dividends to shareholders were $0.25 per share.\nCommon shareholders' tangible equity per share* was $30.78 at December 31, 2017, compared to $31.79 at the preceding quarter end and $31.06 a year ago. The ratio of tangible common shareholders' equity to tangible assets* remained strong at 10.61% at December 31, 2017, compared to 10.39% at the preceding quarter end and 10.83% a year ago. Repurchased 520,166 shares of common stock at an average price of $56.99 per share. Nonperforming assets declined by $4.2 million to $27.5 million or 0.28% of total assets.\n*Revenues from core operations and non-interest income from core operations (both of which exclude fair value adjustments, gains and losses on the sale of securities and gain on the sale of branches), and references to tangible common shareholders' equity per share and the ratio of tangible common equity to tangible assets (both of which exclude goodwill and other intangible assets, net) represent non-GAAP (Generally Accepted Accounting Principles) financial measures. Management has presented these non-GAAP financial measures in this earnings release because it believes that they provide useful and comparative information to assess trends in Banner's core operations reflected in the current quarter's results and facilitate the comparison of our performance with the performance of our peers. Where applicable, comparable earnings information using GAAP financial measures is also presented. See also Non-GAAP Financial Measures reconciliation tables on the last two pages of this press release.\nIncome Statement Review\nBanner’s fourth quarter net interest income, before the provision for loan losses, was $98.3 million, compared to $100.2 million in the preceding quarter and $97.2 million in the fourth quarter a year ago. For the full year 2017, net interest income, before the provision for loan losses, increased 5% to $393.0 million compared to $375.1 million in 2016.\n“Our net interest income decreased compared to the preceding quarter, largely reflecting the sale of the Utah branches and to a lesser extent the balance sheet deleveraging,” said Grescovich. “Our net interest margin also decreased modestly primarily as a result of a reduction in purchased loan discount accretion in the current quarter.” Banner's net interest margin was 4.18% for the fourth quarter of 2017, compared to 4.22% in the preceding quarter and 4.32% in the fourth quarter a year ago. Acquisition accounting adjustments, principally loan discount accretion, added five basis points to the net interest margin in the current quarter compared to ten basis points in the preceding quarter and 19 basis points in the fourth quarter a year ago. For all of 2017, Banner’s net interest margin improved four basis points to 4.24% compared to 4.20% in 2016. Acquisition accounting adjustments added ten basis points to the net interest margin for the year compared to 16 basis points for 2016. The total purchase discount for acquired loans was $21.1 million at December 31, 2017, a decrease from $23.4 million at September 30, 2017 and $32.1 million a year ago, primarily as a result of discount accretion.\nAverage interest-earning asset yields decreased three basis points to 4.40% compared to 4.43% for the preceding quarter and decreased nine basis points compared to 4.49% in the fourth quarter a year ago. Average loan yields decreased six basis points to 4.82% compared to the preceding quarter and decreased 11 basis points from the fourth quarter a year ago. Loan discount accretion added six basis points to loan yields in the fourth quarter, compared to 12 basis points in the preceding quarter and 21 basis points in the fourth quarter a year ago. Deposit costs were 0.15% in the fourth quarter, the same as in the preceding quarter and a two basis point increase compared to the fourth quarter a year ago. The total cost of funds was 0.23% during the fourth quarter, the same as in the preceding quarter and a five basis point increase compared to the fourth quarter a year ago.\n“Our asset quality metrics continue to remain strong, allowing our provision for loan losses to remain modest again this quarter while still maintaining a moderate risk profile,” said Grescovich. Largely as a result of the addition of new loans, the renewal of acquired loans out of the discounted loan portfolio and net charge-offs, Banner recorded a $2.0 million provision for loan losses during the fourth quarter, the same as in both the preceding and year ago quarters.\nDeposit fees and other service charges were $13.0 million in the fourth quarter, a slight decrease compared to $13.3 million in the preceding quarter reflecting the sale of Utah branch deposits at the beginning of the quarter but a increased 7% compared to $12.2 million in the fourth quarter a year ago.\nBanner’s mortgage banking revenues, including gains on one- to four-family and multifamily loan sales and loan servicing fees, increased to $5.0 million in the fourth quarter compared to $4.5 million in the preceding quarter and decreased modestly compared to $5.1 million in the fourth quarter of 2016. Home purchase activity accounted for 71% of fourth quarter one- to four-family mortgage loan originations.\nFourth quarter 2017 results included a $1.0 million net loss for fair value adjustments as a result of changes in the valuation of financial instruments carried at fair value and a $2.3 million net loss on the sale of securities. In the preceding quarter, results included a $493,000 net loss for fair value adjustments that was partially offset by a $270,000 net gain on the sale of securities. In the fourth quarter a year ago, results included a $1.1 million net loss for fair value adjustments that was partially offset by a $311,000 net gain on the sale of securities.\nTotal revenues increased 6% to $128.1 million for the fourth quarter of 2017, compared to $120.5 million in the preceding quarter and increased 10% compared to $116.6 million in the fourth quarter a year ago. For the year ended December 31, 2017, total revenues increased 6% to $486.6 million, compared to $458.5 million for the full year 2016. Reflecting the decline in earning assets as a result of the sale of the Utah branches early in the fourth quarter and balance sheet restructuring later in the quarter, revenues from core operations* (revenues excluding gains and losses on the sale of securities and net change in valuation of financial instruments and in the current quarter the gain on sale of the branches) decreased to $119.3 million in the fourth quarter of 2017, compared to $120.8 million in the preceding quarter, but increased 2% compared to $117.5 million in the fourth quarter of 2016. Despite the sale of the Utah branches, 2017 revenues from core operations* increased 4% to $479.3 million, compared to $460.3 million in 2016.\nTotal non-interest income, which includes the changes in the valuation of financial instruments carried at fair value, gains and losses on the sale of securities, and the gain on sale of the Utah branches, was $29.9 million in the fourth quarter of 2017, compared to $20.3 million in the third quarter of 2017 and $19.5 million in the fourth quarter a year ago. For the year ended December 31, 2017, total non-interest income was $93.5 million compared to $83.5 million in 2016. Non-interest income from core operations,* which excludes gains and losses on sale of securities, net changes in the valuation of financial instruments and the gain on sale of the Utah branches, was $21.0 million in the fourth quarter of 2017, compared to $20.6 million for the third quarter of 2017 and $20.3 million in the fourth quarter a year ago. For all of 2017, non-interest income from core operations* was $86.3 million, compared to $85.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2016.\nBanner’s total non-interest expense was $84.7 million in the fourth quarter of 2017, compared to $82.6 million in the preceding quarter and $79.9 million in the fourth quarter of 2016. The current and preceding quarter's non-interest expenses included increased salary and employee benefits and elevated costs for professional services as compared to the fourth quarter a year ago largely due to enhanced regulatory requirements attributable to compliance and risk management infrastructure build-out. Professional services expense for the current quarter also included an expected seasonal increase for outside audit services. Advertising and marketing expenses were meaningfully higher in the current quarter compared to the preceding quarter but were comparable to the fourth quarter a year ago. Gains on the sale of real estate owned reduced total operating expenses in both the quarter and year ended December 31, 2017. There were no acquisition-related expenses in the current quarter or in the preceding quarter, compared to $788,000 in the fourth quarter a year ago. For the year ended December 31, 2017, non-interest expense was $327.3 million compared to $322.9 million in 2016. Total operating expenses for the year ended December 31, 2016 included $11.7 million of acquisition-related expenses. There were no acquisition-related expenses in 2017.\nFor the fourth quarter of 2017, Banner recorded $55.0 million in state and federal income tax expense, which, in addition to the normal provision for income taxes related to pre-tax income, included a $42.6 million net charge related to the revaluation of its deferred tax assets and liabilities as a result of the Tax Cuts and Jobs act as well as a net credit of $1.7 million for the release of a valuation reserve on an acquisition related net operating loss carryforward deferred tax asset.\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recognized or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income tax expense in the period of enactment.\nBalance Sheet Review\nAs part of its year-end balance sheet restructuring efforts, Banner’s total assets decreased to $9.76 billion at December 31, 2017, compared to $10.44 billion at September 30, 2017. Banner’s total assets were $9.79 billion at December 31, 2016. The total of securities and interest-bearing deposits held at other banks was $1.26 billion at December 31, 2017, compared to $1.68 billion at September 30, 2017 and $1.16 billion at December 31, 2016. The decrease in the securities portfolio at the end of the year reflects Banner's deleveraging strategy to reduce total assets below the $10 billion threshold at the end of 2017 to postpone the adverse impact of the Durbin Amendment. The average effective duration of Banner's securities portfolio was approximately 4.1 years at December 31, 2017, compared to 3.8 years at December 31, 2016.\n“As part of our planned balance sheet restructuring, we reduced our securities and deposit portfolios at the end of the year to keep our asset size below $10 billion,” said Grescovich. “However, net loans increased 2% year over year, with solid production in targeted loan types, including commercial business, construction and land development loans, residential real estate and consumer loans. We continue to see significant potential for growth in our loan origination pipelines due to the robust economic activity in the markets that we serve.”\nAs a result of the sale of our Utah operations, which included the sale of $255 million of loans, net loans receivable decreased to $7.51 billion at December 31, 2017, compared to $7.69 billion at September 30, 2017; however, despite the impact of the sale net loans increased 2% compared to $7.37 billion a year ago. Commercial real estate and multifamily real estate loans decreased slightly to $3.53 billion at December 31, 2017, compared to $3.67 billion at September 30, 2017, and $3.59 billion a year ago. Commercial business loans were $1.28 billion at December 31, 2017, compared to $1.31 billion three months earlier and increased 6% compared to $1.21 billion a year ago. Agricultural business loans declined to $338.4 million at December 31, 2017, compared to $339.9 million three months earlier and $369.2 million a year ago. Total construction, land and land development loans increased 3% to $907.5 million at December 31, 2017, compared to $878.4 million at September 30, 2017, and increased 10% compared to $823.1 million a year earlier. Consumer loans decreased to $688.8 million at December 31, 2017, compared to $701.2 million at September 30, 2017, but increased 6% compared to $650.5 million a year ago largely as a result of a successful second quarter campaign to generate additional home equity lines of credit. One- to four-family loans decreased to $848.3 million compared to $869.6 million at September 30, 2017 but increased 4% compared to $813.1 million a year ago.\nLoans held for sale decreased 43% to $40.7 million at December 31, 2017, compared to $71.9 million at September 30, 2017, and decreased 84% compared to $246.4 million at December 31, 2016. The volume of residential mortgage loans sold was $141.1 million in the current quarter compared to $141.0 million in the preceding quarter and $174.5 million in the fourth quarter a year ago. Banner sold $74.1 million of multifamily loans during the quarter ended December 31, 2017, $86.0 million during the preceding quarter and $16.4 million during the fourth quarter last year. Loans held for sale at December 31, 2017 included $12.9 million of multifamily loans and $27.8 million of one- to four-family loans.\nTotal deposits were $8.18 billion at December 31, 2017, a decrease compared to $8.54 billion at September 30, 2017, also reflecting the Utah branch sale, and a modest increase compared to $8.12 billion a year ago, as strong core deposit growth was partially offset by continuing declines in certificates of deposit. Non-interest-bearing account balances were $3.27 billion at December 31, 2017, compared to $3.38 billion at September 30, 2017 and increased 4% compared to $3.14 billion a year ago. Core deposits (non-interest bearing and interest-bearing transaction and savings accounts) decreased 3% during the current quarter but increased 2% compared to December 31, 2016. Core deposits represented 88% of total deposits December 31, 2017 compared to 87% of total deposits at both September 30, 2017 and a year earlier. Certificates of deposit were $966.9 million at December 31, 2017, compared to $1.10 billion at September 30, 2017 and $1.05 billion a year earlier. Brokered deposits declined to $57.2 million at December 31, 2017, compared to $171.7 million at September 30, 2017 and were $34.1 million a year earlier. The average cost of deposits was 0.15% for the quarter ended December 31, 2017, the same as in the preceding quarter and a two basis point increase compared to the quarter ended December 31, 2016.\nAt December 31, 2017, total common shareholders' equity was $1.27 billion, or $38.89 per share, compared to $1.33 billion at September 30, 2017 and $1.31 billion a year ago. At December 31, 2017, tangible common shareholders' equity*, which excludes goodwill and other intangible assets, was $1.00 billion, or 10.61% of tangible assets*, compared to $1.06 billion, or 10.39% of tangible assets, at September 30, 2017 and $1.03 billion, or 10.83% of tangible assets, a year ago. Banner's tangible book value per share* was $30.78 at December 31, 2017, compared to $31.06 per share a year ago.\nIn addition to the impact of the net loss and dividend payments for the quarter, Banner also reduced its equity capital during the fourth quarter of 2017 through the repurchase of 520,166 shares of its common stock at an average price per share of $56.99 for a total purchase price of $29.6 million that further enhanced its efforts to close the year below $10 billion in total assets. Nonetheless, Banner Corporation and its subsidiary banks continue to maintain capital levels in excess of the requirements to be categorized as “well-capitalized” under the Basel III and Dodd Frank regulatory standards. At December 31, 2017, Banner Corporation's common equity Tier 1 capital ratio was 11.30%, its Tier 1 leverage capital to average assets ratio was 11.33%, and its total capital to risk-weighted assets ratio was 13.80%.\nCredit Quality\nThe allowance for loan losses was $89.0 million at December 31, 2017, or 1.17% of total loans outstanding and 329% of non-performing loans compared to $89.1 million at September 30, 2017, or 1.15% of total loans outstanding and 296% of non-performing loans, and $86.0 million at December 31, 2016, or 1.15% of total loans outstanding and 381% of non-performing loans. Net charge-offs totaled $2.1 million in the fourth quarter compared to $1.5 million in the preceding quarter and $253,000 in the fourth quarter a year ago. Primarily as a result of the addition of new loans and the renewal of acquired loans out of the discounted loan portfolio, as well as the net charge offs, Banner recorded a $2.0 million provision for loan losses in the current quarter which was the same amount as recorded in the prior quarter and in the year ago quarter. Non-performing loans were $27.0 million at December 30, 2017, compared to $30.1 million at September 30, 2017 and $22.6 million a year ago. Real estate owned and other repossessed assets were $467,000 at December 31, 2017, compared to $1.6 million at September 30, 2017 and $11.2 million a year ago.\nIn accordance with acquisition accounting, loans acquired from AmericanWest Bank and Siuslaw Bank in 2015 were recorded at their estimated fair value, which resulted in a net discount to the loans’ contractual amounts, a portion of which reflects a discount for possible credit losses. Credit discounts are included in the determination of fair value, and as a result, no allowance for loan and lease losses is recorded for acquired loans at the acquisition date. Although the discount recorded on the acquired loans is not reflected in the allowance for loan losses or related allowance coverage ratios, we believe it should be considered when comparing the current ratios to similar ratios in periods prior to the acquisitions of AmericanWest Bank and Siuslaw Bank.\nBanner's non-performing assets were $27.5 million, or 0.28% of total assets, at December 31, 2017, compared to $31.7 million, or 0.30% of total assets, at September 30, 2017 and $33.8 million, or 0.35% of total assets, a year ago. In addition to non-performing assets, purchased credit-impaired loans decreased to $21.3 million at December 31, 2017, compared to $23.2 million at September 30, 2017 and $32.3 million a year ago.\nConference Call\nBanner will host a conference call on Thursday, January 25, 2018, at 8:00 a.m. PST, to discuss its fourth quarter and year end results.
