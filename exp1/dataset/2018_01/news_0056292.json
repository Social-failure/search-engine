Shortly afterwards, the plan nose-dived into the Hawkesbury River, north of Sydney.\nNSW police and salvage personnel recover the wreckage of a seaplane that crashed into Jerusalem Bay, north of Sydney, Australia, January 4, 2018. AAP/Mick Tsikas “One of the key lines of enquiry for us is to try and work out exactly what was happening during that time, firstly why the pilot turned and then whether it was an attempt to turn around or a planned turn,” Nat Nagy, executive director of the ATSB, told reporters in Sydney.\nThe ATSB said there was no evidence of a collision or bird strike and there was no sign of any problem with the controls of the plane.\nNagy said the ATSB will announce its findings should it determine the cause of the crash, but warned it may remain unsolved.\n“It is possible that we are not going to find what happened in that cockpit,” said Nagy.\nReporting by Colin Packham in SYDNEY; Editing by Michael Perry\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-31T05:37:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-31T06:11:02.001+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
