Hatch , PhD, CEng, FIMMM, FIET\nChief Executive Officer and Executive Director\nABOUT ALABAMA GRAPHITE CORP.\nAlabama Graphite is a Canadian-based flake graphite exploration and development company as well as an aspiring battery materials production and technology company. Alabama Graphite operates through its wholly owned subsidiary, Alabama Graphite Company, Inc. (a company registered in the state of Alabama). With an advancing flake graphite project in the United States of America, Alabama Graphite intends to become a reliable, long-term U.S. supplier of specialty high-purity graphite products. Alabama Graphite is focused on the exploration and development of its flagship Coosa Graphite Project in Coosa County, Alabama, and its Bama Mine Project in Chilton County, Alabama as well as the research and development of the manufacturing and technological processing of battery materials.\nAlabama Graphite holds a 100% interest in the mineral rights for these two U.S.-based graphite projects, which are both located on private land. The two projects encompass more than 43,000 acres and are located in a geopolitically stable, mining-friendly jurisdiction with significant historical production of crystalline flake graphite in the flake graphite belt of central Alabama, also known as the Alabama Graphite Belt (source: U.S. Bureau of Mines) . A significant portion of the Alabama deposits are characterized by graphite-bearing material that is oxidized and has been weathered into extremely soft rock. Both projects have infrastructure in place, are within close proximity to major highways, rail, power and water, and are approximately three hours (by truck or train) to the Port of Mobile, the Alabama Port Authority’s deep-seawater port and the ninth largest port by tonnage in the United States (source: U.S. Army Corps of Engineers/USACE) . The state of Alabama’s hospitable climate allows for year-round mining operations and the world’s largest marble quarry (which operates 24 hours a day, 365 days a year in Sylacauga, Alabama), is located within a 30-minute drive of the Coosa Graphite Project.\nOn November 30, 2015, Alabama Graphite announced the results of its PEA 2 for t", "external_links": ["http://alabamagraphite.com/", "https://www.globenewswire.com/NewsRoom/AttachmentNg/4c5e4dc1-bcef-4423-b8f1-937307f922db", "http://www.westwaterresources.net/"], "published": "2018-01-08T21:25:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-09T09:40:26.844+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
