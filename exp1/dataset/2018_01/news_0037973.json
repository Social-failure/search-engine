REUTERS/Grigory Dukor The news came hours after the Russian Olympic Committee announced that short-track speed skater Viktor Ahn, biathlete Anton Shipulin and cross-country skier Sergei Ustyugov were not in the pool of Russian athletes eligible to compete at the Pyeongchang Olympics.\nFive members of the Russian men’s national hockey team, Anton Belov, Alexei Bereglazov, Mikhail Naumenkov, Valery Nichushkin and Sergei Plotnikov, were also deemed ineligible for Pyeongchang by the IOC, the Russian hockey federation said in a statement later on Tuesday.\nBelov, a defenceman who played one season with the Edmonton Oilers of the National Hockey League (NHL), served a three-month doping suspension in 2012.\nThe Russian hockey federation said it would seek explanations from the IOC about the players’ exclusion.\nThe Olympic body said on Tuesday that the exclusion of certain athletes from the list of eligible Russians did not mean they had doped.\n“Not being included on the invitation list does not necessarily mean that an athlete has been doped – it should not automatically cast doubt on their integrity,” Valerie Fourneyron, chair of the panel overseeing the invitation process, said in an IOC statement.\nThe IOC banned Russia last month from Pyeongchang over “systematic manipulation” of the anti-doping system at the 2014 Sochi Games, but left the door open to athletes with no history of doping to compete as “Olympic Athletes from Russia”.\nWriting by Polina Ivanova and Gabrielle Tétrault-Farber, additional reporting by Karolos Grohmann in Berlin; Editing by Ed Osmond and Christian Radnedge\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-23T13:25:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-23T13:35:20.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
