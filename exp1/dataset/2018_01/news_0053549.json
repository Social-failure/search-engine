REUTERS/Kevin Lamarque/File Photo \nDuring the hearing before the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee, Democratic Senator Sheldon Whitehouse asked Pruitt if he recalled the interview. Pruitt said he did not. \nRegarding the content of his 2016 remarks, Pruitt said he does not “echo that today at all.” \nPruitt has provoked controversy as Trump’s EPA chief, praised by conservatives and criticized by liberals for rolling back environmental regulations put in place under Democrat Obama and for his role in Trump’s decision to abandon the 2015 Paris global climate change accord. \nHe is one of several Trump appointees who were critical of the president when he was a candidate. For example, Energy Secretary Rick Perry in 2015 said Trump was a “cancer on conservatism” and would ruin the Republican Party. \nAt Tuesday’s hearing, Democrats also pressed Pruitt on his agenda at the EPA of rolling back environmental regulations, and asked him for details on how he would carry out two of his stated priorities - combating lead in drinking water and cleaning up so-called Superfund industrial pollution sites. \nRepublicans at the hearing praised Pruitt for cutting back what they called regulatory red tape that choking rural communities.
