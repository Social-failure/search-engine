Prices peaked at $436.25, matching a level last seen on Dec. 5. \nCBOT March corn futures were up 2-1/4 cents at $3.53 a bushel. \nCBOT March soybeans were down 1 cent at $9.60-3/4 a bushel. \nSoybean losses were kept in check by ongoing concerns that heat in Argentina will limit the size of that country's harvest. \n\"While Argentina did receive good coverage over the past week, temperatures could top 100 degrees (Fahrenheit) (37.8 C) again in some areas by the end of the week before rains return,\" said Bryce Knorr, analyst at Farm Futures. \nShortfall in South American crop production could boost demand for U.S. exports and help alleviate the glut of domestic supplies following the recent bumper harvest. \nUSDA said on Tuesday morning that weekly U.S. soybean export inspections were 1.139 million tonnes, in line with forecasts for 1.1 million to 1.3 million tonnes. \nCorn export inspections were 683,898 tonnes, also in line with trade estimates that ranged from 575,000 to 800,000 tonnes. Export inspections of wheat totalled 274,506 tonnes, below estimates for 300,000 to 600,000 tonnes.
