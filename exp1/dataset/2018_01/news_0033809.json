Then Amadio evened the score by burying a shot from the slot at 6:13, an opportunity created by an errant clearing attempt seconds earlier by New York defenseman Marc Staal.\nTanner Pearson put the Kings ahead at 10:22 with another old-school man-advantage marker, first by being right in front of Lundqvist when Alec Martinez unloaded a shot from the point, then by deflecting the puck past the netminder.\nTrevor Lewis added an empty-net goal with 18 seconds left in the game to cap the scoring.\nMartinez and Drew Doughty each collected a pair of assists for the Kings, who were second in the Pacific Division before their slump but now sit tied for third.\nThe Rangers went into the night with a 7-2-0 record against Pacific Division squads, and they were poised to build on it after the first frame.\nDavid Desharnais opened the scoring at 3:53 when his cross-crease pass went off the skate of Kings defender Derek Forbert and through the legs of a startled Quick. Then Jimmy Vesey was rewarded for his effort to get a stick on the loose puck and banged home a rebound to double the edge at 7:12.\nLundqvist made 26 saves in the loss for the Rangers, who have dropped the first two games of a four-game road swing.\n--Field Level Media\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-01-22T14:47:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-23T18:00:31.004+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
