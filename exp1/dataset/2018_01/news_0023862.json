But he declined to give a timeline. \nAsked about when a joint deposit insurance scheme (EDIS), meant to cover insured savers would be in place, Altmaier said: “We first must reduce risks before there can be risk-sharing. Therefore, from our point of view and from today’s perspective, there cannot be a fixed date.” \nHe added: “In the last two Eurogroup meetings, we agreed to try to come to a common understanding over the next few weeks about what we mean by risk-reduction and what steps are needed for this.” \nCenteno said the banking union was one of many pillars to shield the euro zone from future crisis. He said the currency bloc should not become a transfer union in which richer member states are asked to bankroll poorer peers.
