It was not immediately clear which side the man was on. \nOn Tuesday, Dalit protesters threw stones at buses in various parts of Mumbai, while rail services on a main line across the city were disrupted, said a senior police official who declined to be identified as he is not authorised to speak to the media.

Members of the Dalit community are detained by police during a protest in Mumbai, India January 2, 2018. REUTERS/Danish Siddiqui \nGovernment authorities appealed for calm. \nMaharashtra Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis has ordered a judicial inquiry into the clashes in Pune. \nIndia has about 200 million Dalits, who were previously known as untouchables, and many suffer social deprivation and economic exclusion.
