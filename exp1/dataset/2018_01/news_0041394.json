Alex Pietrangelo’s shot was stopped, but Stastny was on the doorstep and shoved home the rebound past Colorado goalie Jonathan Bernier.\nBrayden Schenn doubled the lead just past the midway point with another man-advantage marker. Schenn grabbed a loose puck after a point shot was blocked, and he ripped a short-side shot inside the post for his 21st goal of the season. Schenn is now riding a four-game point streak in which he has collected four goals and six points.\nSteen rounded out the scoring with just over a minute remaining in regulation. He has amassed four goals and six points in a four-game run.\nPietrangelo also had a two-point outing for the Blues.\nColorado rookie Alexander Kerfoot gave his team some life with his 12th goal of the season at 17:09 of the second period. Hutton stopped a high point shot but couldn’t corral the rebound before Kerfoot got his stick on the puck and banged it home. Rookie Anton Lindholm collected an assist on the goal for his first NHL point, but that was as close as the Avs could get.\nBernier made 31 saves for the Avalanche.\n--Field Level Media\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-01-26T12:07:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-26T21:21:25.012+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
