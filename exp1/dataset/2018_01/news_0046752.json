(Nasdaq: BIIB) today reported full year and fourth quarter 2017 financial results, including:\nFull year total revenues of $12.3 billion, a 7% increase versus the prior year or a 15% increase excluding hemophilia revenues * . Full year multiple sclerosis (MS) revenues grew 4% versus prior year to $9.1 billion, which included $159 million in royalties on our estimate of OCREVUS ® sales. For the fourth quarter of 2017, MS revenues grew 5% versus prior year to $2.3 billion, which included $77 million in royalties on our estimate of OCREVUS sales. U.S. MS revenues in the fourth quarter of 2017 benefited by approximately $40 million from increased inventory in the channel for TECFIDERA ® , AVONEX ® , PLEGRIDY ® , and TYSABRI ® compared to the third quarter of 2017. Full year global TECFIDERA revenues were $4.2 billion, an increase of 6% versus prior year. Full year global TYSABRI revenues were stable at $2.0 billion. Full year revenue growth was driven by the launch of SPINRAZA ® , which contributed $884 million in global revenues. Full year GAAP net income and diluted earnings per share (EPS) attributable to Biogen Inc. of $2.5 billion and $11.92, respectively. GAAP net income and EPS were negatively impacted by $1.2 billion and $5.51, respectively, due to the transition toll tax and re-measurement of our net deferred tax assets related to the U.S. corporate tax reform legislation. GAAP net income and EPS were negatively impacted by $110 million and $0.52, respectively, related to the payment to Neurimmune to reduce the royalty payments on potential commercial sales of aducanumab, Biogen’s investigational treatment for Alzheimer’s disease. GAAP net income and EPS were negatively impacted by $84 million and $0.39, respectively, related to the impairment of ZINBRYTA ® related assets as a result of the Article 20 procedure of ZINBRYTA in the European Union. Full year non-GAAP net income and diluted EPS attributable to Biogen Inc. of $4.6 billion and $21.81, respectively. Non-GAAP net income and EPS were negatively impacted by $61 million and $0.29, respectively, related to the impairment of ZINBRYTA related assets. Full year GAAP and non-GAAP net income and diluted EPS were reduced by $73 million and $0.34, respectively, for R&D charges associated with business development transactions with Alkermes plc and Ionis Pharmaceuticals Inc. (Ionis) in the fourth quarter of 2017.\n* In Q1 2017, Biogen completed the spin-off of its global hemophilia business into a new company, known as Bioverativ.

Ltd. following the initiation of Phase 3 trials for elenbecestat (E2609), a beta secretase cleaving enzyme (BACE) inhibitor in development for Alzheimer’s disease. SG&A expense in the fourth quarter of 2017 increased versus the prior quarter primarily due to timing of spend as well as certain investments across sales and marketing, worldwide medical, and general and administrative expense.\nOther Financial Highlights\nFor 2017 the Company’s effective full year GAAP tax rate was 48%, and the Company’s effective full year non-GAAP tax rate was 25%. For the fourth quarter of 2017 the Company’s effective GAAP tax rate was 112%, and the Company’s effective non-GAAP tax rate was 29%. In the fourth quarter of 2017 Biogen booked a GAAP tax charge of $1.2 billion related to the U.S. corporate tax reform legislation. In the fourth quarter of 2017 Biogen booked a GAAP and non-GAAP tax charge of $42 million and $50 million, respectively, related to the impairment of ZINBRYTA related tax assets. Throughout 2017 Biogen repurchased approximately 4.9 million shares of the Company’s common stock for a total value of $1.4 billion. In the fourth quarter of 2017 Biogen repaid its Senior Notes due March 1, 2018 for $558 million. As of December 31, 2017, Biogen had cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities totaling approximately $6.7 billion, and approximately $5.9 billion in notes payable and other financing arrangements. For 2017 the Company’s full year weighted average diluted shares were 213 million. For the fourth quarter of 2017 the Company’s weighted average diluted shares were 212 million.\n2018 Financial Guidance\nBiogen also announced its full year 2018 financial guidance. This guidance consists of the following components:\nRevenue is expected to be approximately $12.7 billion to $13.0 billion. GAAP and non-GAAP R&D expense is expected to be approximately 16% to 17% of total revenue. This guidance does not include any impact from potential acquisitions or large business development transactions, as both are hard to predict. GAAP and non-GAAP SG&A expense is expected to be approximately 15% to 16% of total revenue. GAAP tax rate is expected to be approximately 23.5% to 24.5%; non-GAAP tax rate is expected to be approximately 22.5% to 23.5%. GAAP diluted EPS is expected to be between $22.20 and $23.20. Non-GAAP diluted EPS is expected to be between $24.20 and $25.20.\nBiogen may incur charges, realize gains, or experience other events in 2018 that could cause actual results to vary from this guidance.\nRecent Events\nIn 2017, Biogen added seven clinical programs to its neuroscience pipeline including BIIB098 (MMF prodrug) for MS, BIIB092 (anti-tau antibody) for both Alzheimer’s disease and progressive supranuclear palsy, BIIB076 (anti-tau antibody) for Alzheimer’s disease, BIIB080 (tau antisense oligonucleotide) for Alzheimer’s disease, BIIB093 (IV glibenclamide) for large hemispheric infarction, and natalizumab for drug-resistant focal epilepsy. In January 2018, Biogen acquired the exclusive worldwide rights to develop and commercialize Karyopharm Therapeutics Inc.’s Phase 1 ready investigational oral compound KPT-350 for the treatment of certain neurological and neurodegenerative conditions, primarily amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). KPT-350 is a novel therapeutic candidate that works by inhibiting XPO1, with the goal of reducing inflammation and neurotoxicity, along with increasing neuroprotective responses. Biogen will pay Karyopharm a one-time upfront payment of $10 million and up to an additional $207 million in milestones, plus tiered royalty payments on potential sales of KPT-350. In January 2018, Biogen dosed the first patient in the Phase 2 SPARK study of BIIB054 (anti-alpha-synuclein antibody) in Parkinson’s disease. In January 2018, Biogen joined Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Pfizer Inc., AbbVie Inc., AstraZeneca PLC, and Alnylam Pharmaceuticals, Inc. in a collaboration to collect genetic information on 500,000 people in the UK Biobank database, a project that could help accelerate new drug discovery and improve approval success rates. Biogen has committed $10 million toward this effort. In January 2018, the European Medicines Agency’s Article 20 Procedure of ZINBRYTA was concluded as the European Commission adopted restrictions to minimize the risk of serious liver injury with ZINBRYTA, including restriction of its use to adult patients with relapsing forms of MS who have had an inadequate response to at least two disease modifying therapies (DMTs) and for whom treatment with any other DMT is contraindicated or otherwise unsuitable. In December 2017, Biogen and Eisai Co., Ltd. announced that an Independent Data Monitoring Committee determined that BAN2401, an anti-amyloid beta protofibril antibody, did not meet the criteria for success based on a Bayesian analysis at 12 months as the primary endpoint in an 856-patient Phase II clinical study (Study 201) for early Alzheimer’s disease. Following the predefined study protocol, the blinded study will continue and a comprehensive final analysis will be conducted at 18 months seeking to demonstrate clinically significant results. The results of the final analysis are expected to be obtained during the second half of 2018. In December 2017, Biogen and Ionis entered into a new collaboration agreement to identify new ASO drug candidates for the treatment of SMA. Biogen will have the option to license therapies arising out of this collaboration and will be responsible for their development and commercialization. In November 2017, Biogen and Alkermes plc entered into a global license and collaboration agreement to develop and commercialize BIIB098, an oral MMF small drug molecule in Phase 3 development for the treatment of relapsing forms of MS. In November 2017, Biogen presented new data from the long-term extension of its ongoing Phase 1b study of aducanumab at the Clinical Trials on Alzheimer’s Disease (CTAD) meeting in Boston, MA. This data includes results from patients in the Phase 1b study who were treated with a gradually increased dose of aducanumab for up to 24 months and those who were treated with a fixed dose of 3, 6, or 10 mg/kg aducanumab for up to 36 months. The results are consistent with previously reported analyses from the Phase 1b study and support the design of the ongoing Phase 3 studies of aducanumab for early Alzheimer’s disease. In November 2017, the end of study results from ENDEAR, the Phase 3 study of SPINRAZA for the treatment of SMA, were published in The New England Journal of Medicine. In October 2017, Biogen and Ionis were awarded the prestigious 2017 Prix Galien USA Award for Best Biotechnology Product for SPINRAZA. The Prix Galien USA Award recognizes extraordinary achievement in scientific innovation that improves the state of human health.\nManagement Updates\nIn December 2017, Jeffrey D.

As we prevailed in the U.S. proceeding in March 2017, we evaluated the recoverability of the U.S. asset acquired from Forward Pharma and recorded an impairment charge to adjust the carrying value of the acquired U.S. asset to fair value. We continue to amortize the remaining net book value of the U.S. and rest of world licenses in our consolidated statements of income utilizing an economic consumption model.\nUpon effectiveness of our settlement and license agreement with Forward Pharma, we agreed to pay Forward Pharma $1.25 billion in cash. TECFIDERA litigation settlement charge for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2016, represents the portion of the $1.25 billion cash payment made in the first quarter of 2017 attributable to our sales of TECFIDERA during the period April 2014 through December 31, 2016.\nB Amortization of acquired intangible assets for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2017, includes a $31.2 million pre-tax impairment charge related to our acquired and in-licensed rights and patents intangible asset due to the European Medicines Agency Article 20 Procedure of ZINBRYTA.\nC Net distribution to noncontrolling interests for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2017, reflects the after-tax $150.0 million upfront payment made to Neurimmune in exchange for a 15% reduction in royalty rates payable on potential commercial sales of aducanumab. This upfront payment is in relation to the amendment of terms of our collaboration agreement with Neurimmune.\nD 2017 corporate strategy and restructuring charges for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2017 are related to our efforts to create a leaner and simpler operating model. We expect to make non-recurring operating and capital expenditures, primarily in 2018, and our goal is to redirect resources of up to $400.0 million annually by 2020 to prioritized research and development and other value creation opportunities.\nRestructuring charges for the twelve months ended December 31, 2016, include $8.0 million of costs incurred in connection with our 2015 corporate restructuring. Restructuring charges for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2016, include charges of $4.4 million and $17.7 million, respectively, incurred in connection with our 2016 restructuring resulting from our decision to spin-off our hemophilia business. Restructuring charges for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2016, also include severance charges of $7.4 million related to employee separation costs as a result of our decision to vacate and cease manufacturing in Cambridge, MA and vacate our warehouse in Somerville, MA.\nE Cambridge manufacturing facility rationalization costs for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2016, reflects $14.0 million and $45.5 million, respectively, of additional depreciation expense included in cost of sales, excluding amortization of acquired intangible assets in our condensed consolidated statements of income. Cambridge manufacturing facility rationalization costs for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2016, also includes charges of $1.4 million and $6.9 million, respectively, for the write-down of excess inventory.\nF On December 22, 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (the 2017 Tax Act) was signed into law and has resulted in significant changes to the U.S. corporate income tax system. The 2017 Tax Act includes a federal corporate rate reduction from 35% to 21%, the elimination or reduction of certain domestic deductions and credits, the transition of U.S. international taxation from a worldwide tax system towards a territorial tax system, limitations on the deductibility of interest expense and executive compensation and base-erosion prevention measures on future non-U.S. earnings of U.S. entities, which has the effect of subjecting certain of our earnings of foreign subsidiaries to U.S. taxation. These changes are effective beginning in 2018.\nThe 2017 Tax Act also includes a one-time mandatory deemed repatriation tax on accumulated foreign subsidiaries' previously untaxed foreign earnings (the Transition Toll Tax).\nChanges in tax rates and tax laws are accounted for in the period of enactment. Therefore, during the year ended December 31, 2017, we recorded a charge totaling $1,173.6 million related to our current estimate of the provisions of the 2017 Tax Act, including a $989.6 million expense under the Transition Toll Tax. The Transition Toll Tax must be paid over an eight-year period, starting in 2018, and will not accrue interest.\nUse of Non-GAAP Financial Measures\nWe supplement our consolidated financial statements presented on a GAAP basis by providing additional measures which may be considered “Non-GAAP” financial measures under applicable SEC rules. We believe that the disclosure of these Non-GAAP financial measures provides additional insight into the ongoing economics of our business and reflects how we manage our business internally, set operational goals and forms the basis of our management incentive programs. These Non-GAAP financial measures are not in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States and should not be viewed in isolation or as a substitute for reported, or GAAP, net income attributable to Biogen Inc. and diluted earnings per share.\nOur “Non-GAAP net income attributable to Biogen Inc.” and “Non-GAAP earnings per share - Diluted” financial measures exclude the following items from \"GAAP net income attributable to Biogen Inc.\" and \"GAAP earnings per share - Diluted\":\n1. Purchase accounting and merger-related adjustments\nWe exclude certain purchase accounting related items associated with the acquisition of businesses, assets and amounts in relation to the consolidation or deconsolidation of variable interest entities for which we are the primary beneficiary. These adjustments include, but are not limited to, charges for in-process research and development, the amortization of certain acquired intangible assets, and charges or credits from the fair value remeasurement of our contingent consideration obligations.\n2. Hemophilia business separation costs\nWe have excluded costs that are directly associated with the set up and spin-off of our hemophilia business into an independent, publicly-traded company on February 1, 2017. These costs represent incremental third party costs attributable solely to hemophilia separation and set up activities.\n3. Restructuring, business transformation and other cost saving initiatives\nWe exclude costs associated with the company’s execution of certain strategies and initiatives to streamline operations, achieve targeted cost reductions, rationalize manufacturing facilities or refocus R&D activities. These costs may include employee separation costs, retention bonuses, facility closing and exit costs, asset impairment charges or additional depreciation when the expected useful life of certain assets have been shortened due to changes in anticipated usage, and other costs or credits that management believes do not have a direct correlation to our on-going or future business operations.\n4. Other items\nWe evaluate other items of income and expense on an individual basis, and consider both the quantitative and qualitative aspects of the item, including (i) its size and nature, (ii) whether or not it relates to our ongoing business operations, and (iii) whether or not we expect it to occur as part of our normal business on a regular basis. We also include an adjustment to reflect the related tax effect of all reconciling items within our reconciliation of our GAAP to Non-GAAP net income attributable to Biogen Inc. and diluted earnings per share.\nTABLE 4 BIOGEN INC.
