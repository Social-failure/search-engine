I am really afraid of this. One accident is enough to precipitate things.”\nHe did not mention Hawaii or North Korea.\nPope Francis has often flagged the danger of nuclear warfare and in November he appeared to harden the Catholic Church’s teaching against nuclear weapons, saying countries should not stockpile them even for the purpose of deterrence.\nAs reporters boarded his plane bound for Chile, Vatican officials handed out a photograph taken in 1945 that shows a young Japanese boy carrying his dead brother on his shoulders following the U.S. nuclear attack on Nagasaki.\n“I was moved when I saw this. The only thing I could think of adding were the words ‘the fruit of war’,” Francis said, referring to a caption put on the back of the image.\n“I wanted to have it reprinted and distributed because an image like this can be more moving than a thousand words. That is why I wanted to share it with you,” he said.\nWriting by Crispian Balmer; editing by Ralph Boulton\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-15T13:57:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-15T14:12:00.084+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
