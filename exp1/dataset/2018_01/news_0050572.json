Cricket - India v South Africa - Third Test match - The Wanderers Stadium, Johannesburg, South Africa - January 26, 2018. South Africaâ€™s Morne Morkel celebrates taking the wicket of Ajinkya Rahane. REUTERS/James Oatway \nThe umpires had suspended play 20 minutes before the close on Friday after deeming the pitch too dangerous to continue as a number of players had been struck by deliveries rising sharply off a good length. \nIt raised the question over whether the test would continue, but after a meeting between the umpires, match referee Andy Pycroft and team representatives, it was decided to play on. \nSouth Africa have an unassailable 2-0 lead in the three-match series, and are seeking a first ever clean-sweep over India.
