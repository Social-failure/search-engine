The benchmark fell 0.2 percent on Monday, slipping below the 6,000 level for the first time this year. \nFinancial stocks led the comeback, with the “Big Four” banks rising in a range of 0.5 percent to 1.5 percent. \nAustralia and New Zealand Banking Group Ltd gained 1.5 percent to settle at its best level since January 11. \nAustralian shares of respiratory device maker ResMed Inc were among the top boosters of the index, gaining 8.4 percent to a record close after it said second-quarter revenue rose 13 percent. \nUpbeat oil prices propped up energy stocks, with Woodside Petroleum Ltd and Origin Energy rallying 1.3 percent and 3.1 percent, respectively. \nShares of Treasury Wine Estates Ltd, the world’s biggest standalone winemaker, rose 4 percent to close at an all-time high. Industry figures showed Australia’s annual wine exports to its No.1 export market China jumped 63 percent by value in 2017. \nFor QBE Insurance Group, Australia’s biggest insurer, it was a rather tough session. Its stock fell as much as 6 percent to its weakest since early October after it flagged a full-year after-tax loss of about $1.2 billion, hurt by impairment charges in its North American operations. \nThe insurer looked in less dire shape at the close as the stock pared most of the losses to be 0.6 percent lower. \nNew Zealand’s benchmark S&P/NZX 50 index fell 0.3 percent or 27.73 points to finish the session at 8,307.63. \nTelecom stock Spark New Zealand Ltd suffered its biggest drop in four months, down 2.5 percent, while Chorus Ltd closed 1.5 percent at a seven-week low. \nFuel supplier Z Energy dropped 2.3 percent to close at its weakest since mid-November after it cut its earnings guidance for fiscal 2018 due to unexpected disruptions of fuel supply in December and a sustained rise in crude oil prices.
