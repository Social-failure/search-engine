The Fed will publish its policy statement on Wednesday following a two-day meeting. Some economists expect it to raise its economic assessment, which would strengthen expectations of the U.S. central bank raising interest rates four times this year. Higher U.S. rates could weigh on demand for emerging market assets, which typically offer higher yields. Traders also avoided risky assets ahead of U.S. President Donald Trump's first State of the Union address later on Tuesday. \"Trade, immigration, and infrastructure are the most highly anticipated areas of focus. Foreign policy will also be closely scrutinized as market participants look to comments on North Korea, Iran, and potentially Russia,\" analysts at Scotiabank wrote in a client note. Currencies from Brazil, Mexico, Chile and Colombia weakened between 0.3 and 0.6 percent. Stocks also fell in the region in the wake of risk-aversion, with MSCI's Latin American index down 1.3 percent. Blue-chips led the decline, with Brazilian lender Ita√∫ Unibanco Holding SA subtracting the most points from the benchmark Bovespa stock index. Shares of wood pulpmaker Fibria Celulose SA, however, rose 2 percent after its operating profit nearly tripled in the third quarter from the year before. Fibria executives on Tuesday denied that the company or its shareholders were discussing a potential tie-up with rival Eldorado Brasil Celulose SA, but underscored their interest in eventual deals in the sector.
