(NYSE: CIT) today reported a fourth quarter net loss to common shareholders of $98 million or $0.74 per diluted common share, compared to a net loss to common shareholders of $1.1 billion or $5.65 per diluted common share for the year-ago quarter. Loss from continuing operations to common shareholders for the fourth quarter was $93 million or $0.70 per diluted common share, compared to a loss to common shareholders of $426 million or $2.11 per diluted common share in the year-ago quarter.\nIncome from continuing operations available to common shareholders excluding noteworthy items for the fourth quarter was $130 million or $0.99 per diluted common share, compared to $125 million or $0.62 per diluted common share in the year-ago quarter, as lower operating expenses, higher other non-interest income and a decline in the provision for credit losses was partially offset by a decline in net finance revenue. The increase in income from continuing operations excluding noteworthy items per diluted common share also reflects a decline in the average number of diluted common shares outstanding due to significant share repurchases in 2017.\nNet income available to common shareholders for the full year was $458 million or $2.80 per diluted common share, compared to a loss to common shareholders of $848 million or $4.20 per diluted common share for the prior year. Income from continuing operations available to common shareholders for the full year was $250 million or $1.52 per diluted common share, compared to a loss to common shareholders of $183 million or $0.90 per diluted common share in the prior year.\nIncome from continuing operations available to common shareholders excluding noteworthy items for the full year was $504 million or $3.07 per diluted common share, compared to $384 million or $1.90 per diluted common share in the prior year, as lower operating expenses, higher other non-interest income and a decline in the provision for credit losses was partially offset by a decline in net finance revenue. The increase in income from continuing operations excluding noteworthy items per diluted common share also reflects a decline in the average number of diluted common shares outstanding due to significant share repurchases in 2017.\n\"We achieved a number of milestones in 2017 and entered this year as a simpler and stronger company that is positioned for growth,\" said Chairwoman and Chief Executive Officer Ellen R. Alemany. \"We addressed non-core assets and legacy issues, reduced operating expenses, strengthened our funding profile, and expanded our business footprint in key markets. We also continued to build the consumer deposit franchise with the direct bank, adding 31,000 customers and 76,000 accounts this year.\"\nAlemany continued, \"Core results in the fourth quarter were strong. We grew commercial loans and leases and posted the highest origination volume in over eight quarters. This was offset by a number of noteworthy items.\"\n\"Looking to 2018, we are positioned to advance our strategic plan, further build on our strengths in the middle market, small business and consumer deposits, and deliver value for shareholders.\"\nReturn on Tangible Common Equity (ROTCE) 3 for continuing operations was 8.4%. ROTCE for continuing operations excluding noteworthy items 3 was 8.5%. Tangible book value per common share at Dec. 31, 2017 was $49.58. The preliminary Common Equity Tier 1 Capital ratio increased to 14.4%, and the preliminary Total Capital ratio increased to 16.1%, at Dec 31, 2017. These capital ratios are calculated under the fully phased-in regulatory capital rules.\nFinancial results for the fourth quarter in continuing operations were impacted by noteworthy items.\nNoteworthy items (after tax) in the fourth quarter of 2017 in continuing operations included:\n$222 million ($1.69 per diluted common share) non-cash goodwill impairment charge in the Commercial Banking segment (no impact on regulatory capital ratios or tangible book value); $20 million ($0.15 per diluted common share) restructuring charge in operating expenses; $12 million ($0.09 per diluted common share) in aggregate net benefits related to U.S. tax reform; $10 million ($0.08 per diluted common share) net deferred income tax benefit from tax items related to NACCO, our European Rail business; $9 million ($0.07 per diluted common share) net expense related to the cumulative effect of changing the accounting policy for Low Income Housing Tax Credits (LIHTC) investments from the equity method to the proportional amortization method, including a $29 million benefit in other non-interest income and a $38 million expense in the provision for income taxes; and $6 million ($0.05 per diluted common share) benefit in net finance revenue from the suspension of the depreciation of assets related to NACCO that are in assets held for sale.\nSelected Financial Highlights\n4Q17 change* from\n2017 change* from\n($ in millions)\n4Q17\n3Q17\n4Q16\n3Q17\n4Q16\n2017\n2016\n2016\nNet finance revenue\n$ 399\n$ 401\n$ 421\n$ (1)\n$ (21)\n$ 1,606\n$ 1,715\n$ (109)\nNon-interest income\n137\n63\n(118)\n74\n255\n364\n151\n214\nTotal net revenue\n537\n464\n303\n73\n234\n1,970\n1,866\n105\nNon-interest expenses\n561\n331\n699\n231\n(138)\n1,664\n1,650\n14\nIncome (loss) from continuing operations before credit provision\n(25)\n133\n(396)\n(158)\n371\n306\n216\n91\nProvision for credit losses\n30\n30\n37\n0\n(6)\n115\n195\n(80)\nIncome (loss) from continuing operations before benefit\n(provision) for income taxes\n(55)\n103\n(432)\n(158)\n377\n192\n21\n171\nProvision (benefit) for income taxes\n28\n(120)\n(7)\n148\n34\n(68)\n204\n(271)\nIncome (loss) from continuing operations\n(83)\n223\n(426)\n(306)\n343\n259\n(183)\n442\n(Loss) income from discontinued operations, net of taxes\n(5)\n(3)\n(717)\n(2)\n712\n209\n(665)\n874\nNet income (loss)\n(88)\n220\n(1,143)\n(308)\n1,055\n468\n(848)\n1,316\nPreferred Dividends\n10\n-\n-\n10\n10\n10\n-\n10\nNet income (loss) available to common shareholders\n$ (98)\n$ 220\n$ (1,143)\n$ (317)\n$ 1,045\n$ 458\n$ (848)\n$ 1,306\nIncome (loss) from continuing operations available to common\nshareholders\n$ (93)\n$ 223\n$ (426)\n$ (315)\n$ 333\n$ 250\n$ (183)\n$ 432\nPer common share\nEarnings (loss) per diluted common share\n$ (0.74)\n$ 1.61\n$ (5.65)\n$ (2.35)\n$ 4.91\n$ 2.80\n$ (4.20)\n$ 7.00\nTangible book value per common share (TBVPS)(1)\n$ 49.58\n$ 48.58\n$ 45.41\n$ 1.00\n$ 4.17\n$ 49.58\n$ 45.41\n$ 4.17\nAverage diluted common shares outstanding (in thousands)\n131,343\n136,126\n202,083\n(4,783)\n(70,740)\n163,950\n201,850\n(37,900)\nCapital adequacy\nCET1 Ratio(3)\n14.4%\n14.0%\n13.8%\n40bps\n60bps\n14.4%\n13.8%\n60bps\nTotal Capital Ratio(3)\n16.1%\n15.7%\n14.6%\n40bps\n150bps\n16.1%\n14.6%\n150bps\nAsset quality\nNet charge-offs as a % of average loans\n0.26%\n0.58%\n0.32%\n(30)bps\n(6)bps\n0.39%\n0.37%\n2bps\nAllowance for loan losses as a % of loans\n1.48%\n1.47%\n1.46%\n1bps\n2bps\n1.48%\n1.46%\n2bps\nKey performance metrics\nNet finance margin(1)\n3.59%\n3.53%\n3.58%\n6bps\n1bps\n3.43%\n3.60%\n(17)bps\nLoans and leases to deposit ratio\n130%\n127%\n150%\n300bps\nNM\n130%\n150%\nNM\nCIT Bank Loans and leases to deposit ratio\n104%\n102%\n98%\n200bps\n578bps\n104%\n98%\n578bps\nReturn on average common equity\n-4.73%\n11.86%\n-41.61%\nNM\nNM\n5.48%\n-7.65%\nNM\nReturn on tangible common equity (continuing operations)(2)\n8.42%\n14.58%\n-4.68%\nNM\nNM\n7.72%\n3.17%\nNM\nReturn on tangible common equity (continuing operations),\nexcluding noteworthy items(2)\n8.47%\n9.20%\n8.37%\n(73)bps\n10bps\n8.24%\n6.71%\n153bps\nReturn on AEA, applicable to common shareholders\n-0.88%\n1.93%\n-9.73%\n(281)bps\n885bps\n3.91%\n-7.12%\nNM\nReturn on AEA, excluding noteworthy items(1)\n1.12%\n1.21%\n1.79%\n(9)bps\n(67)bps\n4.84%\n5.95%\n(112)bps\nNet efficiency ratio(1)\n49.6%\n57.8%\n109.2%\nNM\nNM\n56.4%\n65.5%\n(910)bps\nHeadcount\n3,909\n3,965\n4,078\n(56)\n(169)\n3,909\n4,078\n(169)\n* Certain balances may not sum due to rounding.\n(1) See \"Non-GAAP Measurements\" at the end of this press release and beginning on page 28 for a reconciliation of non-GAAP to GAAP financial information and noteworthy items.\n(2) Excludes noteworthy items and pro forma for capital reduction associated with Commercial Air sale that occurred in 2Q17.

The decrease was driven primarily by an increase in the provision for credit losses and the preferred dividend, partially offset by an increase in other non-interest income and a decline in operating expenses.\nCompared to the year-ago quarter, income from continuing operations available to common shareholders excluding noteworthy items increased by $5 million, as lower operating expenses, higher other non-interest income and a decline in the provision for credit losses was partially offset by a decline in net finance revenue.\nNet Finance Revenue\nNet Finance Revenue*\n4Q17 change from\n($ in millions)\n4Q17\n3Q17\n4Q16\n3Q17\n4Q16\nInterest income\n$ 448\n$ 454\n$ 474\n$ (6)\n-1%\n$ (26)\n-6%\nRental income on operating leases\n253\n252\n252\n0\n0%\n0\n0%\nDepreciation on operating lease equipment\n74\n71\n70\n3\n5%\n5\n6%\nMaintenance and other operating lease expenses\n58\n58\n58\n-\n0%\n0\n1%\nNet rental income on operating leases\n120\n123\n125\n(3)\n-2%\n(4)\n-4%\nInterest expense\n169\n177\n178\n(8)\n-5%\n(10)\n-5%\nNet finance revenue\n$ 399\n$ 401\n$ 421\n$ (1)\n0%\n$ (21)\n-5%\nAverage earning assets\n$ 44,562\n$ 45,454\n$ 46,965\n$ (892)\n-2%\n$ (2,403)\n-5%\nNet finance margin\n3.59%\n3.53%\n3.58%\n6bps\n-\nExcluding Noteworthy Items (1)\nNet finance revenue\n$ 391\n$ 393\n$ 421\n$ (2)\n-1%\n$ (30)\n-7%\nAverage earning assets\n$ 44,562\n$ 45,454\n$ 46,965\n$ (892)\n-2%\n$ (2,403)\n-5%\nNet finance margin\n3.51%\n3.46%\n3.58%\n5bps\n(8)bps\n(1) See \"Non-GAAP Measurements\" at the end of this press release and beginning on page 28 for a reconciliation of non-GAAP to GAAP financial information and noteworthy items.\n* Certain balances may not sum due to rounding.\nNet finance revenue 4 was $399 million compared to $401 million in the prior quarter. Net finance revenue in the current and prior quarters include a $9 million and $8 million benefit, respectively, from the suspension of depreciation expense related to NACCO because its assets are included in assets held for sale. Excluding noteworthy items, net finance revenue4 was $391 million, compared to $393 million in the prior quarter, as lower purchase accounting accretion, lower income from cash balances and higher depreciation on operating leases were mostly offset by higher interest income on loans, including higher interest recoveries, and lower interest expense from the repayment of unsecured debt at the end of the prior quarter.\nNet finance revenue as a percentage of average earning assets (\"net finance margin 4 \") excluding noteworthy items was 3.51%, a 5 bps increase from 3.46% in the prior quarter. The increase in net finance margin reflects a decline in average earning assets (AEA), primarily from a reduction in lower-yielding cash balances, partially offset by the aforementioned drivers of the net decline in net finance revenue.\nCompared to the year-ago quarter, net finance revenue excluding noteworthy items decreased $30 million or 7%, and net finance margin decreased 8 bps. The decrease in net finance revenue primarily reflected lower purchase accounting accretion and lower gross yields in Rail, partially offset by higher earnings on investment securities. The decrease in net finance margin reflected the aforementioned drivers of the decrease in net finance revenue, partially offset by a decline in AEA, primarily from a reduction in lower-yielding cash balances.\nOther Non-interest Income\nOther Non-Interest Income*\n4Q17 change from\n($ in millions)\n4Q17\n3Q17\n4Q16\n3Q17\n4Q16\nFee revenues\n$ 30\n$ 26\n$ 27\n$ 4\n16%\n$ 4\n13%\nFactoring commissions\n27\n27\n26\n(0)\n-1%\n1\n4%\nGains on sales of leasing equipment\n9\n12\n11\n(3)\n-25%\n(1)\n-13%\nGains on investments\n12\n10\n22\n2\n24%\n(10)\n-44%\nGains on loan and portfolio sales\n7\n4\n23\n4\n97%\n(16)\n-69%\n(Loss) gain on OREO\n5\n(4)\n2\n9\nNM\n3\nNM\nNet gains (losses) on derivatives and foreign currency exchange\n7\n1\n52\n6\nNM\n(45)\n-87%\nImpairment on assets\n(7)\n(22)\n-\n14\n67%\n(7)\nNM\nOther revenues\n47\n9\n(279)\n39\nNM\n326\nNM\nTotal other non-interest income\n$ 137\n$ 63\n$ (118)\n$ 74\nNM\n$ 255\nNM\nTotal other non-interest income, excluding noteworthy items (1)\n$ 108\n$ 90\n$ 103\n$ 18\n20%\n$ 4\n4%\n(1) See \"Non-GAAP Measurements\" at the end of this press release and beginning on page 28 for a reconciliation of non-GAAP to GAAP financial information and noteworthy items.\n* Certain balances may not sum due to rounding.\nOther non-interest income in the current quarter included a $29 million benefit in other revenues related to the cumulative effect of an accounting policy change for LIHTC investments, which was more than offset by a related $38 million expense in the provision for income taxes. Total other non-interest income in the prior quarter included noteworthy items totaling $27 million in aggregate charges related to the Financial Freedom Transaction. Excluding noteworthy items, total other non-interest income 5 was $108 million in the current quarter, compared to $90 million in the prior quarter. The increase was primarily driven by an increase in capital markets fees, net gains on asset sales, foreign exchange and derivatives, a full quarter of income related to Bank-Owned Life Insurance (BOLI) and losses related to the LIHTC investments that were reported in other non-interest income in the prior quarter. Factoring commissions remained unchanged as increases in volumes were offset by decreases in pricing.\nIn the year-ago quarter, noteworthy items in other non-interest income included an approximately $245 million net charge related to the termination of a portion of the total return swap and a $22 million gain related to the sale of our Canadian Equipment and Corporate Finance businesses. Other non-interest income in the current quarter, excluding noteworthy items, increased by $4 million from the year-ago quarter, primarily driven by income from BOLI and an increase in capital markets fees, partially offset by a decrease in foreign exchange and derivatives. Factoring commissions increased slightly as growth in factoring volume in Commercial Services was offset by lower pricing.\nOperating Expenses\nOperating Expenses*\n4Q17 change from\n($ in millions)\n4Q17\n3Q17\n4Q16\n3Q17\n4Q16\nCompensation and benefits\n$ 139\n$ 139\n$ 133\n$ (0)\n0%\n$ 5\n4%\nTechnology\n31\n31\n40\n0\n0%\n(9)\n-23%\nProfessional fees\n29\n32\n59\n(3)\n-10%\n(30)\n-51%\nInsurance\n16\n19\n19\n(3)\n-15%\n(3)\n-18%\nNet occupancy expense\n17\n16\n20\n1\n4%\n(3)\n-14%\nAdvertising and marketing\n13\n14\n6\n(1)\n-6%\n7\n103%\nOther expenses\n23\n18\n54\n4\n24%\n(31)\n-58%\nOperating expenses, excluding restructuring costs and intangible\nasset amortization\n266\n268\n331\n(2)\n-1%\n(65)\n-20%\nIntangible asset amortization\n6\n6\n6\n(0)\n-2%\n(0)\n-5%\nRestructuring costs\n32\n3\n4\n29\nNM\n28\nNM\nTotal operating expenses\n$ 304\n$ 277\n$ 341\n$ 27\n10%\n$ (37)\n-11%\nNet efficiency ratio\n49.6%\n57.8%\n109.2%\nNM\nNM\nTotal operating expenses, excluding noteworthy items and\nintangible asset amortization (1)\n$ 266\n$ 268\n$ 304\n$ (2)\n-1%\n$ (38)\n-12%\nNet efficiency ratio, excluding noteworthy items and intangible\nasset amortization (1)\n53.4%\n55.5%\n57.9%\n(220)bps\n(460)bps\n(1) See \"Non-GAAP Measurements\" at the end of this press release and beginning on page 28 for a reconciliation of non-GAAP to GAAP financial information and noteworthy items.\n* Certain balances may not sum due to rounding.\nOperating expenses excluding noteworthy items and intangible asset amortization 6 in the current quarter was $266 million, down slightly from $268 million in the prior quarter, driven primarily by a reversal of a litigation provision and a true-up of FDIC insurance costs.\nOperating expenses in the year-ago quarter included $27 million in charges from legacy OneWest Bank matters. Compared to the year-ago quarter, operating expenses excluding noteworthy items and intangible asset amortization decreased $38 million or 12%, primarily reflecting lower professional fees and technology expenses, partially offset by higher advertising and marketing costs, primarily in Consumer Banking, and higher compensation and benefits expenses.\nThe net efficiency ratio 6 improved to 50% compared to 58% in the prior quarter. The net efficiency ratio excluding noteworthy items 6 was 53%, compared to 56% in the prior quarter, driven by a decrease in operating expenses and an increase in net revenue. Compared to the year-ago quarter, the net efficiency ratio excluding noteworthy items improved from 58%, driven by the decrease in operating expenses.\nGoodwill Impairment\nWe recognized $256 million (pre-tax) in goodwill impairment charges in the current quarter, mostly related to Equipment Finance in our Commercial Banking segment. In the year-ago quarter, we recognized $354 million in goodwill impairment charges, including a $319 million charge related to our Consumer Banking segment and a $35 million charge related to Commercial Services in our Commercial Banking segment.\nIncome Taxes\nThe provision for income taxes in the current quarter of $28 million included an aggregate $26 million benefit from noteworthy items, including the impact of tax items related to NACCO, the change in accounting policy for LIHTC and U.S. tax reform (see page 3) and an additional aggregate $22 million in discrete tax benefits from other tax adjustments, including the reversal of a valuation allowance related to a restructured international legal entity. The benefit for income taxes in the prior quarter of $120 million included a $140 million benefit from a noteworthy item related to the restructuring of an international legal entity. The benefit for income taxes in the year-ago quarter of $7 million included a $54 million tax expense noteworthy item resulting from no longer asserting indefinite reinvestment of earnings in Canada.\nThe effective tax rate in the current quarter was negative 50%. Excluding noteworthy items, the effective tax rate was 28%. Excluding noteworthy items and discrete tax items, the effective tax rate was 39% for the quarter and 34% for the full year 2017.

Compared with the year-ago quarter, average earning assets declined $2.4 billion, or 5%, reflecting a decline in interest-bearing cash and loans in Commercial Finance, along with run-off of legacy portfolios. Total loans and leases increased 2% from the prior quarter and 1% from the year-ago quarter, driven by strong origination volumes in Commercial Banking.\nCash and Investment Securities\nInterest-bearing cash and investment securities (including securities purchased under agreements to resell) were $8.1 billion at Dec. 31, 2017, and consisted of $1.4 billion of interest-bearing cash and $6.6 billion of investment securities. In addition, there was approximately $0.3 billion of non-interest-bearing cash. Investment securities increased $875 million during the quarter.\nOf the interest-bearing cash and investment securities, $6.8 billion was at CIT Bank and $1.0 billion was at the financial holding company, while the remaining $0.3 billion consisted of amounts held at the operating subsidiaries and restricted balances.\nDeposits and Borrowings\nDeposits and Borrowings*\n4Q17 change from\n($ in millions)\n4Q17\n3Q17\n4Q16\n3Q17\n4Q16\nNoninterest-bearing checking\n$ 1,352\n$ 1,360\n$ 1,256\n$ (8)\n-1%\n$ 96\n8%\nInterest-bearing checking\n2,653\n2,658\n3,252\n(5)\n0%\n(599)\n-18%\nMoney market/Sweeps\n5,076\n4,928\n6,593\n148\n3%\n(1,518)\n-23%\nSavings\n5,987\n5,892\n4,303\n95\n2%\n1,684\n39%\nTime deposits\n14,344\n14,584\n16,729\n(240)\n-2%\n(2,385)\n-14%\nOther\n158\n173\n172\n(15)\n-9%\n(14)\n-8%\nTotal deposits\n$ 29,569\n$ 29,595\n$ 32,304\n$ (25)\n0%\n$ (2,735)\n-8%\nUnsecured borrowings\n$ 3,738\n$ 3,748\n$ 10,599\n(11)\n0%\n(6,862)\n-65%\nSecured borrowings\n5,237\n4,783\n4,337\n454\n9%\n900\n21%\nTotal borrowings\n$ 8,974\n$ 8,531\n$ 14,936\n$ 443\n5%\n$ (5,961)\n-40%\n* Certain balances may not sum due to rounding.\nDeposits represented approximately 77% of CIT's funding at Dec. 31, 2017, a slight decrease from Sept. 30, 2017. Unsecured borrowings comprised 10% of the funding mix at Dec. 31, 2017, unchanged from the level at Sept. 30, 2017, while secured borrowings comprised 13% of the funding mix at Dec. 31, 2017 compared to 12% at Sept. 30, 2017, reflecting increased FHLB advances.\nDeposit growth in the online channel was more than offset by declines in higher-cost deposits in the brokered channel and certain deposits in the commercial channel. The loans and leases-to-deposits ratio at CIT Bank was 104% at Dec. 31, 2017 compared to 102% at Sept. 30, 2017. For CIT Group, the loans and leases-to-deposits ratio was 130% at Dec. 31, 2017 compared to 127% at Sept. 30, 2017.\nThe weighted average rate on total outstanding deposits increased to 1.24% in the current quarter from 1.22% in the prior quarter and 1.19% in the year-ago quarter, reflecting modest increases in the average savings account rate offset by a reduction in higher-cost brokered and commercial deposits. The weighted average coupon on our unsecured debt was 4.81% at Dec. 31, 2017, unchanged from Sept. 30, 2017.\nCapital\nCapital*\n4Q17 change from\n($ in millions, except per share data)\n4Q17\n3Q17\n4Q16\n3Q17\n4Q16\nCommon stockholders' equity\n$ 6,995\n$ 7,126\n$ 10,003\n$ (131)\n-2%\n$ (3,008)\n-30%\nTangible common equity\n$ 6,512\n$ 6,382\n$ 9,177\n$ 130\n2%\n$ (2,665)\n-29%\nTotal risk-based capital (1)\n$ 7,231\n$ 7,087\n$ 9,480\n$ 144\n2%\n$ (2,249)\n-24%\nRisk-weighted assets (1)\n$ 44,802\n$ 45,124\n$ 65,068\n$ (321)\n-1%\n$ (20,266)\n-31%\nBook value per share (BVPS)\n$ 53.25\n$ 54.25\n$ 49.50\n$ (1.00)\n-2%\n$ 3.75\n8%\nTangible book value per share (TBVPS)\n$ 49.58\n$ 48.58\n$ 45.41\n$ 1.00\n2%\n$ 4.17\n9%\nCET1 ratio (1)\n14.4%\n14.0%\n13.8%\n40bps\n60bps\nTotal capital ratio (1)\n16.1%\n15.7%\n14.6%\n40bps\n150bps\nTier 1 leverage ratio (1)\n13.8%\n13.4%\n13.9%\n40bps\n(10)bps\n* Certain balances may not sum due to rounding.\n(1)Balances and ratios on fully phased-in basis.\nCommon stockholders' equity decreased from the prior quarter, driven by the net loss in the current quarter; however, tangible common equity increased from the prior quarter as the current quarter loss was driven by the goodwill impairment. Capital actions during the quarter included repurchases of approximately 122,000 common shares at an average share price of $47.23, a quarterly cash dividend of $0.16 per common share and a semi-annual preferred cash dividend of $30.29 per preferred share ($10 million) on outstanding preferred stock.\nTotal common shares outstanding was 131.3 million at Dec. 31, 2017, down from 131.4 million at Sept. 30, 2017 and 202.1 million at Dec. 31, 2016.\nTangible book value per common share increased in the quarter to $49.58 due to earnings in the quarter, excluding the goodwill impairment, and the slightly reduced share count.\nThe preliminary Common Equity Tier 1 Capital ratio increased from the prior quarter to 14.4%. Common Equity Tier 1 Capital increased as earnings excluding the goodwill impairment were partially offset by dividends. Risk-weighted assets (RWA) decreased, primarily reflecting the sale of certain investment securities and a decrease in on- and off-balance sheet factoring balances, partially offset by an increase in loans. The preliminary Total Capital ratio also increased from the prior quarter to 16.1%. The ratios presented are estimated Common Equity Tier 1 and Total Capital ratios under the fully phased-in regulatory capital rules.\nOn Jan. 22, 2018, the Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.16 per common share on outstanding common stock.

The provision in the prior quarter of $30 million included a charge of $15 million related to the transfer of the reverse mortgage portfolio to assets held for sale in Consumer Banking.\nCompared to the year-ago quarter, the provision for credit losses decreased from $37 million primarily due to lower net charge-offs.\nNet Charge-offs\nNet charge-offs were $18 million (0.26% of average loans), compared to $42 million (0.58% of average loans) in the prior quarter and $24 million (0.32% of average loans) in the year-ago quarter. The prior quarter included charge-offs related to the transfer of the reverse mortgage portfolio to assets held for sale. Excluding a $15 million charge-off related to the Financial Freedom Transaction, net charge-offs in the prior quarter was $26 million (0.36% of average loans).\nLoan Loss Allowance\nThe allowance for loan losses was $431 million (1.48% of loans, 1.67% excluding loans subject to loss sharing agreements with the FDIC) at Dec. 31, 2017, compared to $420 million (1.47% of loans, 1.68% excluding loans subject to loss sharing agreements with the FDIC) at Sept. 30, 2017 and $433 million (1.46% of loans, 1.72% excluding loans subject to loss sharing agreements with the FDIC) at Dec. 31, 2016.\nPurchase credit impaired (PCI) loans acquired as part of the OneWest acquisition are carried at a significant discount to the unpaid principal balance. At Dec. 31, 2017, PCI loans with an aggregate unpaid principal balance of $2.9 billion were carried at $2.0 billion, representing a 32% discount. The vast majority of the discount is related to our legacy consumer mortgages (LCM) portfolio in Consumer Banking.\nNon-accrual Loans\nNon-accrual loans of $221 million (0.76% of loans) were down compared to the prior and year-ago quarters and remain at relatively low levels. The declines were primarily due to payoffs in full of loans previously on non-accrual.\nCommercial Banking\nEarnings Summary*\n4Q17 change from\n($ in millions)\n4Q17\n3Q17\n4Q16\n3Q17\n4Q16\nInterest income\n$ 315\n$ 309\n$ 322\n$ 5\n2%\n$ (8)\n-2%\nRental income on operating leases\n253\n252\n252\n0\n0%\n0\n0%\nInterest expense\n139\n131\n127\n7\n6%\n12\n9%\nDepreciation on operating lease equipment\n74\n71\n70\n3\n5%\n5\n6%\nMaintenance and other operating lease expenses\n58\n58\n58\n-\n0%\n0\n1%\nNet finance revenue\n296\n301\n320\n(5)\n-2%\n(24)\n-7%\nOther non-interest income\n73\n71\n92\n2\n3%\n(19)\n-20%\nProvision for credit losses\n29\n11\n31\n18\n158%\n(2)\n-7%\nOperating expenses\n168\n169\n183\n(1)\n0%\n(15)\n-8%\nGoodwill impairment\n256\n-\n35\n256\nNM\n221\nNM\n(Loss) income before income taxes\n$ (83)\n$ 193\n$ 163\n$ (276)\nNM\n$ (246)\nNM\nSelect Average Balances\nAverage loans (1)\n$ 21,420\n$ 20,978\n$ 21,773\n$ 443\n2%\n$ (353)\n-2%\nAverage operating leases (1)\n$ 7,841\n$ 7,798\n$ 7,426\n$ 43\n1%\n$ 415\n6%\nAverage earning assets (2)\n$ 29,507\n$ 29,011\n$ 29,505\n$ 496\n2%\n$ 3\n0%\nKey Metrics\nPre-tax ROAEA\n-1.13%\n2.66%\n2.21%\nNM\nNM\nNet finance margin\n4.01%\n4.16%\n4.34%\n(15)bps\n(33)bps\nNew business volume\n$ 2,902\n$ 2,044\n$ 2,042\n$ 858\n42%\n$ 860\n42%\nNet efficiency ratio\n45.1%\n44.9%\n44.1%\n20bps\n100bps\n(1) Amounts include held for sale.

In addition, the current and prior quarters both included a benefit from the suspension of depreciation expense related to NACCO of $9 million and $8 million, respectively. Excluding noteworthy items, pre-tax earnings of $164 million decreased from the prior quarter of $185 million, primarily driven by an increase in the credit provision and a decrease in net finance revenue. Compared to the year-ago quarter, pre-tax earnings excluding noteworthy items decreased from $198 million as decreases in net finance revenue and other non-interest income were partially offset by a decrease in operating expenses.\nNet Finance Revenue and Margin\nExcluding the noteworthy items in the current and prior quarters from the suspension of depreciation expense related to NACCO, net finance revenue decreased $6 million from the prior quarter. The decrease was primarily driven by higher interest expense, lower purchase accounting accretion in Commercial Finance and Real Estate Finance and lower net rental income in Rail, partially offset by interest recoveries and the impact of asset growth and higher interest rates. Compared to the year-ago quarter, excluding the suspension of depreciation expense related to NACCO in the current quarter, net finance revenue decreased primarily due to higher interest expense, lower purchase accounting accretion and lower net rental income in Rail, partially offset by interest recoveries and the impact of higher interest rates. Rail's net rental decline, excluding the suspension of depreciation expense related to NACCO, from both the prior and year-ago quarters were mainly driven by renewal rates that continue to price lower due to excess capacity in the market.\nNet finance margin decreased compared to the prior quarter from the aforementioned decreases in net finance revenue despite a higher average earning asset level. Compared to the year-ago quarter, net finance margin decreased due to the decrease in net finance revenue as average earning asset levels were essentially unchanged.\nLoans and Leases\nAverage loans and leases, which comprise the vast majority of earning assets, was $29.3 billion, a 2% increase compared to the prior quarter, driven by growth in Business Capital and in Commercial Finance, which had a strong quarter for originations, partially offset by continued elevated prepayments.\nNew lending and leasing volume increased to $2.9 billion from $2.0 billion in the prior quarter, mainly driven by increases in Commercial Finance and Business Capital, although all divisions had increases. Compared to the year-ago quarter, new lending and leasing volume increased, primarily driven by growth in Commercial Finance.\nFactoring volume of $7.7 billion was up 7% from the prior quarter and up 13% compared to the year-ago quarter, driven primarily by increased volume in the technology industry.\nOther Non-interest Income\nOther non-interest income increased $2 million from the prior quarter, as higher capital markets fee income in Commercial Finance was partially offset by lower gains on asset sales in Business Capital and Rail. Compared to the year-ago quarter, other non-interest income decreased $19 million, primarily driven by lower gains on sales as the year-ago quarter included a $22 million gain on an investment related to a loan workout in Commercial Finance.\nOperating Expenses\nOperating expenses was essentially unchanged from the prior quarter. Compared to the year-ago quarter, operating expenses decreased by $15 million, reflecting cost reduction initiatives.\nAsset Quality\nThe provision for credit losses increased from the prior quarter primarily reflecting the establishment of reserves on asset growth in Commercial Finance. Compared to the year-ago quarter, the provision for credit losses increased modestly as lower net charge-offs were more than offset by the establishment of reserves on asset growth in the current quarter.\nNet charge-offs were $18 million (0.32% of average loans), down from $22 million (0.39% of average loans) in the prior quarter and $23 million (0.41% of average loans) in the year-ago quarter.\nThe allowance for loan losses was $402 million (1.74% of loans) at Dec. 31, 2017, compared to $392 million (1.73% of loans) at Sept. 30, 2017 and $408 million (1.81%of loans) at Dec. 31, 2016.\nNon-accrual loans were $191 million (0.82% of loans), compared to $241 million (1.06% of loans) at Sept. 30, 2017, and $251 million (1.11% of loans) at Dec. 31, 2016. The decrease from the prior quarter primarily reflected a decrease in Commercial Finance from loan payoffs. The decrease from the year-ago quarter primarily reflected declines in Commercial Finance and Real Estate Finance, partially offset by an increase in Business Capital.\nCommercial Banking Division Highlights\nCommercial Finance\nA strong quarter of $1.3 billion in originations led to a 2% increase in average loans and leases compared to the prior quarter. Capital markets fee income increased in the quarter.\nRail\nAverage loans and leases of $7.5 billion includes approximately $1.1 billion in assets held for sale related to NACCO. North America rail car utilization improved marginally. Gross yields declined 19 basis points from the prior quarter, as renewal lease rates continued to re-price lower on average across the portfolio.\nReal Estate Finance\nAverage loans and leases, excluding legacy non-SFR assets, increased 1% from the prior quarter. Gross yields declined 14 basis points from the prior quarter, as higher contractual yields were more than offset by lower purchase accounting accretion.\nBusiness Capital\nAll divisions of Business Capital experienced growth in average loans and leases from strong originations in the quarter. Factoring volume in the Commercial Services business increased compared to the prior and year-ago quarters, primarily driven by the technology sector.\nConsumer Banking\nEarnings Summary*\n4Q17 change from\n($ in millions)\n4Q17\n3Q17\n4Q16\n3Q17\n4Q16\nInterest income\n$ 84\n$ 92\n$ 107\n$ (8)\n-9%\n$ (23)\n-21%\nInterest benefit\n(20)\n(16)\n(4)\n(4)\n-23%\n(16)\nNM\nNet finance revenue\n104\n108\n111\n(4)\n-4%\n(7)\n-6%\nOther non-interest income\n13\n(23)\n7\n36\n158%\n6\n89%\nProvision for credit losses\n2\n19\n6\n(17)\n-91%\n(4)\n-69%\nGoodwill impairment\n-\n-\n319\n-\nNM\n(319)\nNM\nOperating expenses\n104\n106\n123\n(3)\n-3%\n(19)\n-16%\nIncome (loss) before income taxes\n$ 12\n$ (40)\n$ (331)\n$ 52\n130%\n$ 342\n104%\nSelect Average Balances\nAverage loans (1)\n$ 6,728\n$ 6,711\n$ 7,107\n$ 17\n0%\n$ (379)\n-5%\nAverage earning assets\n$ 6,886\n$ 6,904\n$ 7,458\n$ (19)\n0%\n$ (572)\n-8%\nKey Metrics\nPre-tax ROAEA\n0.69%\n-2.30%\n-17.73%\n299bps\nNM\nNet finance margin\n6.04%\n6.27%\n5.93%\n(23)bps\n11bps\nNew business volume\n$ 422\n$ 223\n$ 199\n$ 199\n89%\n$ 223\n113%\nNet efficiency ratio\n84.4%\n118.9%\n100.5%\nNM\nNM\n(1) Amounts include held for sale.\n* Certain balances may not sum due to rounding.\nSegment Financial Results\nPre-tax earnings in the Consumer Banking segment excluding noteworthy items was $12 million compared to $2 million in the prior quarter, primarily driven by higher earnings from the reverse mortgage portfolio as higher gains on asset sales was partially offset by lower purchase accounting accretion. Noteworthy items in the prior quarter included $42 million of charges related to the Financial Freedom Transaction. Compared to the year-ago quarter, pre-tax earnings excluding noteworthy items was essentially flat. Noteworthy items in the year-ago quarter included aggregate charges of $347 million from goodwill impairment and charges from legacy OneWest Bank matters.\nNet Finance Revenue and Margin\nNet finance revenue of $104 million decreased from the prior quarter and the year-ago quarter, as higher negative income on the indemnification asset for the covered loans and lower interest income due to suspended purchase accounting accretion from the held for sale reverse mortgage portfolio were partially offset by an increase in the benefit in interest expense received from the other segments for the value of the excess deposits Consumer Banking generates.\nAverage Loans\nAverage loans, including loans held for sale, totaled $6.7 billion and was essentially unchanged from the prior quarter, as run-off of the LCM portfolio was offset by new business volume in the Other Consumer Banking division. Compared to the year-ago quarter, average loans declined 5% due to the run-off in LCM partially offset by growth in Other Consumer Banking. The LCM portfolio made up $4.3 billion of the balance as of Dec. 31, 2017, with a significant portion covered by loss sharing agreements with the FDIC. The benefit of these agreements is recorded within the indemnification asset.\nOther Non-interest Income\nOther non-interest income included $27 million in charges in the prior quarter from impairments on reverse mortgage related assets related to the Financial Freedom Transaction. Excluding noteworthy items, other non-interest income increased by $9 million and $6 million, respectively, compared to the prior and year-ago quarters due to an increase in gains on asset sales from the reverse mortgage portfolio.\nOperating Expenses\nOperating expenses was essentially unchanged compared to the prior quarter. Compared to the year-ago quarter and excluding noteworthy items of $27 million in the year-ago quarter, operating expenses increased primarily driven by higher advertising and marketing expenses.\nAsset Quality\nExcluding a $15 million charge-off related to the Financial Freedom Transaction in the prior quarter, the provision for credit losses was comparable to the prior and year-ago quarters. Non-accrual loans were $20 million (0.34% of loans) at Dec. 31, 2017, compared to $19 million (0.33% of loans) at Sept. 30, 2017, and $17 million (0.25% of loans) at Dec. 31, 2016, essentially all of which are in the LCM portfolio.

Operating expenses in the current quarter benefited from the reversal of a previously-established litigation provision. The prior quarter reflected higher operating costs, partially offset by higher other income, related to winding down our international locations. The year-ago quarter included a $22 million gain related to the sale of our Canadian Equipment and Corporate Finance businesses reflected in other non-interest income.\nAssets held for sale at Dec. 31, 2017 was $63 million, which was all related to our business in China.

In addition, certain costs associated with debt redemptions are maintained at Corporate.\nPre-tax income in the current quarter was $12 million, while losses in the prior and year-ago quarters were $47 million and $288 million, respectively. The current quarter included a $29 million benefit related to the cumulative effect of an accounting policy change for LIHTC investments, which was more than offset by a related $38 million expense in the provision for income taxes, while the prior quarter included $54 million in debt extinguishment costs, and the year-ago quarter included a net charge related to the termination of a portion of the total return swap of approximately $245 million. Excluding noteworthy items, the pre-tax income in the current quarter was $9 million, the pre-tax income in the prior quarter was $9 million, and the pre-tax loss in the year-ago quarter was $40 million. Net finance revenue improved from the prior quarter. Other non-interest income excluding noteworthy items increased $11 million from the prior quarter, primarily driven by a full quarter of income from BOLI and losses related to the LIHTC investments that in the prior quarter were reported in other non-interest income, while other non-interest income excluding noteworthy items increased from the year-ago quarter due to BOLI and realized gains on investment securities. Operating expenses in the current quarter benefitted from lower professional fees and lower FDIC insurance expense. Operating expenses for the year-ago quarter were driven by $17 million in consulting spending related to CCAR project costs and organizational design and $7 million in systems write-offs. Additionally, operating expenses included $32 million in restructuring charges, compared to $3 million in the prior quarter and $4 million in the year-ago quarter.\nDiscontinued Operations:\nDiscontinued operations at the end of the fourth quarter consisted of our Business Air portfolio and Financial Freedom. On Oct. 6, 2017, we announced an agreement to sell Financial Freedom, which is expected to close in the second quarter of 2018 and is subject to certain regulatory and investor approvals and other customary closing conditions.\nThe loss in the current quarter from Discontinued Operations was $5 million.
