Good ball striking, good putting equals low rounds.”\nJan 20, 2018; La Quinta, CA, USA; Andrew Landry lines up a putt on the ninth green during the third round of the CareerBuilder Challenge golf tournament at PGA West TPC Stadium Course. Mandatory Credit: Joe Camporeale-USA TODAY Sports Landry (70) stayed in contention as he remained bogey-free through 54 holes. He and Piercy (67) are both seeking their first tour victory.\nSpanish world number three Rahm struggled with his swing but a 70 at the Stadium Course was enough to remain within striking distance.\nSlideshow (4 Images) ”Things have been a little worse and worse (each round),“ he said. ”First day everything was outstanding. Yesterday my driver was a little shaky but my iron shots were perfect.\n“Today my driver was shaky, my iron shots were shaky and a course like this is really punishing but luckily the holes I found the fairway I was able to convert and make birdies.”\nRahm narrowly avoided major trouble at the water-surrounded par-three 17th when his ball took one bounce into the hazard, where it struck a rock and then ricocheted back toward the green.\nThough still in the hazard, his ball was playable almost up against a rock but affording him a short backswing and while the recovery attempt was not without risk -- another player had attempted a similar shot only to get into further trouble -- Rahm chipped his ball out and two putted for bogey.\nReporting by Andrew Both in Cary, North Carolina; Editing by Greg Stutchbury\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-01-21T08:53:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-21T04:11:24.010+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
