While CIBC is pushing ahead with the listing plan, it could decide not to proceed if it fails to achieve its targeted valuation, three of the sources said. \nCIBC is working with Barclays and UBS to advise it on the potential listing, three of the sources said. \nThe bank declined to comment on Thursday. Sources declined to be identified as the information is not public. \nThe bank said in December it was considering a listing of FirstCaribbean in the United States but had yet to make a decision. \nFirstCaribbean reported net income of $142 million last year and would be worth just over $1.4 billion if it achieved a valuation of 10 times earnings. That compares with its current market value of $2 billion, according to FirstCaribbean’s 2017 annual report, meaning the bank would be selling its 20 percent stake at a discount of $120 million or 30 percent. \nTwo of the sources said CIBC executives first began to consider listing FirstCaribbean in New York after seeing the success of a listing in September 2016 by Bermuda’s largest independent lender, Butterfield Bank ( NTB.N ). \nButterfield, which is also listed on the Bermuda Stock Exchange, raised $287.5 million through its listing, giving it a market value of $1.3 billion, roughly 10.4 times its earnings that year. \nShares in Butterfield have since risen by more than 70 percent and the business is now worth more than $2.2 billion, trading at 22 times earnings. \nInvestors have been attracted to Butterfield by its improving profitability and strong market positions in Bermuda and the Cayman Islands, which have thriving economies built on providing financial services for international business and luxury facilities for tourists. \nFirstCaribbean also operates in the Bahamas and Cayman Islands but its biggest market is Barbados, whose credit profile has been declining due to a mounting debt problem. \nCIBC is taking advantage of bullish U.S. stock markets, which are trading at record highs and a run-up in the share prices of U.S. banks, one source said.
