(TSX: REAL) (“Real Matters” or “the Company”), a leading network management services platform for the mortgage and insurance industries, today announced its financial results for the first quarter ended December 31, 2017.\n“We were very pleased with our performance in the first quarter,” said Real Matters Chief Executive Officer Jason Smith. “We generated consolidated revenues of $73.9 million which represented strong organic growth of 19% on a market adjusted basis. Appraisals and ancillary services delivered market adjusted revenue growth of 28% driven by our year-over-year market share gains, and the title and closing business grew organically with market adjusted revenue growth of 4%. We also recorded Net Revenue (A) margin expansion on a sequential basis.”\n“The first quarter of fiscal 2017 was a peak quarter for rate refinance originations, which declined an estimated 50% since that time, making it a tough comparison. The U.S. mortgage origination market continues to be very healthy, fueled in part by a steadily growing purchase market. Higher interest rates resulting in lower mortgage refinancing transactions have contributed to a more normalized market since the second quarter of fiscal 2017 – and we’ve seen that come across in our results since that time,” added Smith.\n“We are on track with our appraisal market share goals for 2018 - and out to 2021. We signed two new Tier 2 appraisal clients in the first quarter, which have since gone live. We have also progressed our title and closing pipeline within Top 100 lenders, making us confident in our ability to achieve our 2018 objectives for title and closing,” concluded Smith.\nQ1 2018 Financial Highlights\nConsolidated revenues of $73.9 million compared with $78.9 million in Q1 2017 Net Revenue (A) of $22.5 million, compared with $26.0 million in Q1 2017 Net Revenue (A) margins (as a percentage of consolidated revenues) of 30.4% from 33.0% in Q1 2017 Adjusted EBITDA (A) of $2.4 million compared with $5.5 million in Q1 2017 Net loss of $5.4 million or ($0.06) per diluted share, compared with a net loss of $2.3 million\nor ($0.03) per diluted share in Q1 2017 Adjusted Net Income (A) of $1.3 million or $0.01 per diluted share, compared with Adjusted Net Income (A) of $1.9 million or $0.02 per diluted share in Q1 2017\nConsolidated revenues were down 6.4% to $73.9 million due to a $5.5 million decline in title and closing revenues, which was partially offset by an increase in appraisal and ancillary revenues. U.S. revenues were down 7.4% to $66.4 million from the first quarter of 2017 principally as a result of the decline in title and closing which was partially offset by organic growth in appraisal volumes from market share gains with new and existing clients. The decline in the refinance mortgage originations market had a significant impact on the Company’s title and closing revenues in the first quarter of fiscal 2018 due to its high correlation to refinance related volumes. U.S. segment revenues represented 90% of consolidated revenues in Q1 2018. Revenues in Canada increased 4.2% to $7.4 million the first quarter of 2018 due to higher appraisal volumes and foreign exchange net of lower market activity.\nNet Revenue (A) decreased to $22.5 million from $26.0 million in Q1 2017, and Net Revenue (A) margins decreased to 30.4% from 33.0% in Q1 2017 due to changes in revenue mix between appraisal and title and closing, as well as changes in the product mix within each of those services lines.\nAdjusted EBITDA (A) decreased to $2.4 million from $5.5 million in Q1 2017 due to a significant decline in the residential mortgage originations market, specifically for refinance mortgage activity, the mix of business, and higher public company costs.\n(tabular amounts are expressed in thousands of U.S. dollars, unless otherwise stated)\nThree months ended December 31, 2017\nDecember 31, 2016\nConsolidated Statement of Operations Revenues $ 73,870 $ 78,894 Transaction costs 51,385 52,877 Operating expenses 20,378 20,522 Acquisition and IPO (recovery) costs (7) 421 Integration expenses 50 - Amortization 5,316 5,198 Interest expense 156 254 Interest income (106) - Net foreign exchange gain (642) (3,741) (Gain) loss on fair value of warrants (767) 4,505 Re-measurement gain on previously held equity method investment (499) - Net income from equity accounted investees - (105) Loss before income tax expense (1,394) (1,037) Net income tax expense 3,995 1,248 Net loss $ (5,389) $ (2,285) Net Revenue (A) $ 22,485 $ 26,017 Adjusted EBITDA (A) $ 2,391 $ 5,495 Adjusted Net Income (A) $ 1,256 $ 1,896 Note (A) - Net Revenue, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted Net Income are Non-GAAP measures.

However, the Company considers certain non-GAAP financial measures as useful additional information in measuring its financial performance and condition. These measures, which the Company believes are widely used by investors, securities analysts and other interested parties in evaluating our performance, do not have a standardized meaning prescribed by GAAP and therefore may not be comparable to similarly titled measures presented by other publicly traded companies, nor should they be construed as an alternative to financial measures determined in accordance with IFRS. Non-GAAP measures include “Adjusted EBITDA”, “Net Revenue” and “Adjusted Net Income or Loss”. See \"Non-GAAP measures\" in Real Matters’ MD&A for the quarters ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 for a more complete description of these terms.\nAdjusted EBITDA\nThree months ended December 31 2017 2016 Net loss $ (5,389) $ (2,285) Stock-based compensation expense 284 - Acquisition and IPO (recovery) costs (7) 421 Integration expenses 50 - Amortization 5,316 5,198 Interest expense 156 254 Interest income (106) - Net foreign exchange gain (642) (3,741) (Gain) loss on fair value of warrants (767) 4,505 Re-measurement gain on previously held equity method investment (499) - Net income from equity accounted investees - (105) Income tax expense 3,995 1,248 Adjusted EBITDA $ 2,391 $ 5,495 Management typically calculates Adjusted EBITDA as follows:\nThree months ended December 31 2017 2016 Revenues $ 73,870 $ 78,894 Less: Transaction costs 51,385 52,877 Less: Operating expenses 20,378 20,522 Add: Stock-based compensation expense 284 - Adjusted EBITDA $ 2,391 $ 5,495 Net Revenue\nThree months ended December 31 2017 2016 Net loss $ (5,389) $ (2,285) Operating expenses 20,378 20,522 Acquisition and IPO (recovery) costs (7) 421 Integration expenses 50 - Amortization 5,316 5,198 Interest expense 156 254 Interest income (106) - Net foreign exchange gain (642) (3,741) (Gain) loss on fair value of warrants (767) 4,505 Re-measurement gain on previously held equity method investment (499) - Net income from equity accounted investees - (105) Income tax expense 3,995 1,248 Net Revenue $ 22,485 $ 26,017 Management typically calculates Net Revenue as follows:\nThree months ended December 31 2017 2016 Revenues $ 73,870 $ 78,894 Less: Transaction costs 51,385 52,877 Net Revenue $ 22,485 $ 26,017 Adjusted Net Income\nThree months ended December 31 2017 2016 Net loss $ (5,389) $ (2,285) Stock-based compensation expense 284 - Acquisition and IPO (recovery) costs (7) 421 Integration expenses 50 - Amortization of intangibles 4,890 4,814 Net foreign exchange gain (642) (3,741) (Gain) loss on fair value of warrants (767) 4,505 Re-measurement gain on previously held equity method investment (499) - Related tax effects (1,371) (1,818) Impact of the statutory income tax rate change (U.S. tax reform) 4,707 - Adjusted Net Income $ 1,256 $ 1,896 Weighted average number of shares outstanding (thousands), diluted 92,084 82,760 Adjusted Net Income per share, diluted $ 0.01 $ 0.02 Forward-Looking Statements\nThis new release contains forward-looking statements that relate to our current expectations and views of future events including with respect to future market share and future results.
