They all claim that Google paid them less or otherwise discriminated against them because they are women, CNN reports. \nThe lawsuit also defines classes of workers that plaintiffs allege Google discriminated against. They include female engineers, researchers, managers, salespeople and teachers, according to the Guardian . \n“It feels really scary to speak up, but I do it for the women I work with and the women who are still at Google. We deserve to make livable wages,” Lamar told the Guardian . \nFortune reached out to Google for comment, but did not receive an immediate response.
