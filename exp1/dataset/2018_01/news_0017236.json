The Wildcats hit only two of their first 10 3-point attempts and found themselves trailing late in the first half. DiVincenzo and Jalen Brunson made 3-pointers in the final three minutes as Villanova closed out the first half with a 13-4 run and took a 34-27 lead into halftime.\nThe Wildcats maintained the advantage throughout the second half, but couldn’t slam the door on the Red Storm until the final minute.\nDiVincenzo drained a 3-pointer from the corner to push the Villanova lead to 69-58 with four minutes to play.\nSt. John’s mounted one last rally, with Ponds capping a 7-0 run with a pair of free throws to cut the deficit to 69-65 with one minute left. He shot 15 of 28 from the floor but 0 of 6 beyond the 3-point arc.\nPonds was the only St. John’s player to reach double figures in points. Bashir Ahmed and Justin Simon each finished with seven points.\nVillanova made seven consecutive free throws in the final minute, and Bridges dunked to finish off the scrappy Red Storm.\nVillanova has bounced back from its only loss of the season, at Butler on Dec. 30, with three straight wins. The Wildcats continue a stretch of three straight road games at Georgetown on Wednesday.\nIt doesn’t get any easier for the Red Storm, who travel to No. 10 Xavier on Wednesday.\n--Field Level Media\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-01-14T11:42:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-14T20:24:04.025+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
