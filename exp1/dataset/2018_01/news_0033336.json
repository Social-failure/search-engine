The measure had drawn opposition from a coalition of privacy-minded Democrats and libertarian Republicans.\nIn his tweet on Friday, Trump attempted to clarify why he signed the bill despite repeating an unsubstantiated claim that his Democratic predecessor, Barack Obama, ordered intelligence agencies to eavesdrop on Trump's 2016 Republican presidential campaign.\n\"This is NOT the same FISA law that was so wrongly abused during the election,\" Trump wrote. \"I will always do the right thing for our country and put the safety of the American people first!\" (Reporting by Dustin Volz; Editing by Sandra Maler and Jonathan Oatis)", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-19T23:31:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-20T00:25:22.005+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
