She later apologised for the text messages and Bolton said they were ending their romantic relationship.\nBolton lost a vote of confidence from the party’s national executive committee but has insisted that he would not quit.\nUKIP’s deputy leader, Margot Parker, resigned in protest at Bolton’s refusal to go, the BBC reported.\nLed by the Farage, UKIP won nearly four million votes in 2015, 12.6 percent of those cast, on its anti-EU platform, projecting it to the forefront of British politics even though it only managed to win one seat in parliament.\nIts popularity prompted Cameron, who once dismissed the party as being full of “fruitcakes, loonies and closet racists”, to hold the referendum and played a major role in securing a vote to leave the EU.\nBut since then it has been riven by internal strife and it won just 1.8 percent of the total votes cast in a national election last June.\nReporting by Guy Faulconbridge; editing by Michael Holden\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-01-22T16:10:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-22T19:24:53.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
