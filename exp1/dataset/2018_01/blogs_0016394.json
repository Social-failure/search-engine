The monument was built just a few blocks from the headquarters of the foreign ministry.\nThe panel will be composed of representatives from the foreign and public works ministries, the city government of Manila, the capital, and the NHCP.\nReporting by Enrico dela Cruz; Editing by Martin Petty and Clarence Fernandez\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-12T12:54:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-12T13:49:50.011+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
