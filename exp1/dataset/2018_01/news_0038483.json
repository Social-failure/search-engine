You’ve got to pay up. People do appear to be a bit sceptical on the price, but not overtly so,” said Terry Torrison, managing director at Monaco-based McLaren Securities.\nPrime Partners’ fund manager Francois Savary took a more upbeat view of the transaction.\n“In my view, it’s essentially a positive deal. It should strengthen their capacity to grow in the medium term,” said Savary, whose firm owns Sanofi shares.\nReporting by Sudip Kar-Gupta; Editing by Laurence Frost\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-01-22T16:21:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-22T10:49:33.017+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
