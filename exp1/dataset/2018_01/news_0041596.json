Overall, the demographics of the Chinese workforce will become much older. By that time China will hit a kind of speed bump. \n\"The age of the demographics, the size of the population — especially the young population — is critical for innovation. Going forward, China will still enjoy 10 to 20 years of very healthy demographics.\" \nChina began unwinding its One Child Policy in late 2015, extending it instead to allow couples to have two children.
