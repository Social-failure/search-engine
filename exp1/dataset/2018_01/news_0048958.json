The economy grew by 2.2 percent if not adjusted for the lower number of workdays last year.\nThe Ifo economic institute is a bit more optimistic than the government, forecasting an expansion of 2.6 percent in 2018.\nWriting by Michael Nienaber, Editing by Angus MacSwan\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-01-29T23:13:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-30T19:13:20.006+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
