All business sectors are now experiencing Gen V cyber-attacks which are characterized by polymorphic malware that is moving fast and attacks a broad set of targets. These sophisticated attacks on mobile, cloud and enterprise networks utilize sophisticated code and bypass conventional, static detection-based defenses being used by most organizations today. To protect networks and data against these attacks, organizations need to advance to Gen V cyber-security utilizing Check Point Infinity, which combines real-time threat prevention, behavioral analysis, shared intelligence and the most advanced security across networks, cloud and mobile.\nInfinity Total Protection is a game-changing new consumption model with a simple all-inclusive, per-user, per-year subscription. The offering enables enterprises to fully utilize Gen V security across their entire network. Infinity Total Protection is a subscription solution that includes both network security hardware and software, with fully integrated endpoint, zero-day threat prevention, cloud and mobile protections, combined with unified management and 24×7 premium support.\n‘Gen V’ Security Management: The latest Smart-1 Appliances power Gen V security management by delivering management storage capacity of up to 48TB, logging rates of up to 100,000 logs/sec and a performance boost of up to 8x compared to previous models. This enables exceptional security management performance across network, cloud and mobile environments for efficient Gen V cyber protection with holistic, single-console security management and the ability to correlate, store and analyze huge amounts of new and historic data from thousands of network devices.\nHighest Security Effectiveness and Lowest TCO Scores: In NSS Labs’ First-Ever Breach Prevention System Test Check Point SandBlast received a recommended rating while achieving the highest level of security effectiveness and the lowest total cost of ownership. The recommended rating further validates Check Point’s substantial ability to protect organizations by preventing even the most advanced cyber-attacks.\n“Our industry is at an inflection point where cyber-attacks are becoming increasingly more sophisticated and security infrastructure needs to significantly advance to effectively combat these threats. Enterprises need to adopt Gen V cyber protections. This year, we will focus on enabling our customers to make this generational leap in security infrastructure,” concluded Shwed.\nConference Call and Webcast Information\nCheck Point will host a conference call with the investment community on January 31, 2018, at 8:30 AM ET/5:30 AM PT.
