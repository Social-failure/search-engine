A street-lamp is seen on the flooded banks of the Seine River in Paris, France, after days of almost non-stop rain caused flooding in the country, January 24, 2018. REUTERS/Christian Hartmann \nIt did not say whether it was moving artworks from the area. \n“A crisis unit is monitoring the situation in real time,” the Louvre said in a statement. Slideshow (6 Images) \nIt noted that no damage was incurred in 2016, when similar measures were taken for fear of water damage to exhibits. \nForecasters predicted further flooding could lift the river by 6 meters (yards) or more in total. With the water level rising one to two centimeters per hour, the river had hit 5.24 meters at 1 p.m. (1200 GMT/0800 EST) on Wednesday. \nCrunch-time is expected on Friday or Saturday, following more heavy rainfall forecast for Thursday. \nFlooding caused destruction in Paris in 1910, when the Seine rose by 8.65 meters, a level that was topped only once on record, in February 1658.
