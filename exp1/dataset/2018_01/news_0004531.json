Bannon supported Republican Roy Moore, the ex-judge who lost to Democrat Doug Jones in the deep-red state amid accusations of teen sexual abuse decades ago.\nBannon also alienated Mercer with remarks \"that seemed to stoke unnecessary fights,\" the newspaper said. It did not specify what those remarks were.\nThe report followed the Wednesday revelation of Bannon's explosive comments to reporter Michael Wolff. Among other remarks, Bannon called Donald Trump Jr.'s June 2016 meeting with a Russian lawyer \"treasonous.\"\nThe Bannon Quote: s from Wolff's upcoming book \"Fire and Fury\" prompted a remarkable statement from President Donald Trump , in which he declared that his former key advisor had \"lost his mind.\"\nTrump's personal attorney sent a cease and desist letter to Wolff and his publisher, Henry Holt & Co., and demanded an apology for the content of the book.\nMercer, a major GOP donor, is the daughter of hedge fund manager Robert Mercer. The family has funneled millions of dollars into Republican super PACs and Bannon's initiatives.\nCNBC could not immediately reach Mercer for comment.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-04T16:56:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-04T16:56:03.024+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
