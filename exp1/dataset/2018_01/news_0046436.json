They were salt in the wound,” said Kathy Lien, managing director at BK Asset Management in New York. \nBut other factors have been driving the extended decline in the dollar, she said. “I think we are due for a rebound. What we are seeing now is some profit-taking.” FILE PHOTO: The London Stock Exchange Group offices are seen in the City of London, Britain, December 29, 2017.
