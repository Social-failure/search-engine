People always rip me a new one for that. ‘Carl, you’re racist, you can‘t, you’re sexist.’ I‘m like, Jesus Christ, I just don’t like Muslim people because their ideology sucks,” he says in one excerpt, describing Islam as “the ideology of a child molester”.\nIn another he tells Muslims: “Go back to your Muslim shithole and go crap in your hands and bang little boys on Thursday nights.”\nTrump was accused by Democratic Senator Dick Durbin of repeatedly using the word “shithole” when speaking about African countries during a meeting about immigration last week at the White House, causing diplomatic outrage in many African countries.\nTrump has denied he is a racist, telling a reporter on Sunday: “I‘m the least racist person you have ever interviewed.”\nReporting by Rich McKay; Editing by Robin Pomeroy and Kevin Liffey\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-01-19T19:42:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-19T14:12:29.024+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
