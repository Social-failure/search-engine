The kingdom has become a major importer of wheat since abandoning plans in 2008 to become self-sufficient as farming in the desert was draining scarce water supplies.\nHSBC said it had reviewed the business and operating models of the milling companies to incorporate feedback received through the public consultation process and investors’ workshop in June 2017.\nIt also said it had prepared regulations on the privatisation based on the draft sector law issued by the Ministry of Environment, Water and Agriculture, while SAGO had reviewed the business and operating models of the milling companies to ensure they complied with the law.\nThe draft regulations will be published for public consultation once approved by the authorities, HSBC added.
