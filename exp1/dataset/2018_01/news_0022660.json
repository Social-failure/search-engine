A lot of them have found their product market fit; some haven't. While we raced to build these new features, the app became too cluttered. Expect to see us invest in massively simplifying and streamlining Messenger this year,\" Marcus wrote in the post, titled \"Six Trends for 2018.\" \nAt the same time, Marcus sees Messenger and the broader messaging market, which also includes Facebook-owned WhatsApp, becoming more visual. \n\"I predict visual messaging will fully explode in 2018; people will expect a super fast and intuitive camera, video, images, GIFs, and stickers with almost every conversation. Even in the workplace where conversations can be more serious, we see people embracing emojis and video to help drive a point home,\" he wrote. \nMessenger currently has 1.3 billion monthly users. Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg also said last week that the company would be making a \"major change\" to users' news feeds to emphasize more \"relevant content,\" which could result in people spending less time on the platform.
