He died in a hospital in Trujillo state, the public prosecutor’s office said in a statement.\nA relative unknown in Venezuelan politics, Lucena was a member of the 545-strong ‘Constituent Assembly’ created last year by socialist President Nicolas Maduro in a move widely condemned by Western powers and fellow Latin American nations.\nSpeaking during an hours-long televised broadcast, Maduro alleged that Lucena, a father of three young children, had been targeted for political reasons.\nVenezuela's President Nicolas Maduro (2nd L) speaks during a meeting with ministers in Caracas, Venezuela January 11, 2018.
