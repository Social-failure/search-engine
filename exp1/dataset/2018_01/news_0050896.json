So investors are waiting for some clear direction and political stability after the polls,” said Prashan Fernando, CEO at Acuity Stockbrokers. \nThe Colombo stock index ended up 0.35 percent at 6,476.41, its highest close since Jan. 11. The index rose 0.19 percent last week, recording its first weekly gain in three. \nShares in conglomerate John Keells Holdings Plc closed up 1.1 percent, while Janashakthi Insurance Company Plc rose 17.7 percent. Dialog Axiata Plc ended 1.5 percent higher. \nForeign investors bought a net 18.5 million rupees worth of shares on Tuesday, extending the year-to-date net foreign inflow to 4.04 billion rupees worth of equities. \nSri Lanka’s stock, bond and foreign exchange markets are closed on Wednesday for a Buddhist religious holiday. Markets will resume trading on Thursday.
