Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer also said a deal was possible, but accused the White House of making “unreasonable” demands on immigration.\n“Hopefully we could come to some agreement within the next week,” Pelosi told a small group of reporters in her office.\nCongress and the White House have been locked in talks on spending and immigration. If they do not make a deal by Jan. 19, when current government spending authority expires, a partial shutdown of the government could follow.\nSchumer said on the Senate floor that, following an encouraging meeting last week, the White House has issued “a series of unreasonable demands,” including calling for $18 billion to fund construction of a wall along the southwestern border with Mexico.\nU.S. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) speaks to reporters after the weekly party caucus luncheons at the U.S. Capitol in Washington, U.S. January 4, 2018. REUTERS/Jonathan Ernst Republican President Donald Trump also wants to pump up military spending in the fiscal year that began Oct. 1. Democrats want any Pentagon spending increase to go with more money for non-defense programs, some of which have been capped.\nRepublicans have majorities in both chambers of Congress, but Democrats are needed to get spending bills past procedural hurdles in the Senate.\nDemocrats want to protect undocumented people who immigrated illegally into the United States as children, known as “Dreamers.” Trump in September said he was terminating the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program and challenged Congress to come up with legislation to protect around 700,000 “Dreamers” from deportation.\nPelosi said on Monday the budget and DACA issues were linked. “We won’t sign off on DACA until we have a caps deal,” she said.\nBut she added: “I think the opportunity is there. I do think the president sincerely would like to deal with DACA. I think ... a large number of Republicans would vote for a DACA agreement.”\nReporting by Susan Cornwell; Editing by Kevin Drawbaugh and Marguerita Choy\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-09T00:54:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-09T09:40:19.342+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
