This leads us to lower our outlook for '18 ad growth, now forecasting flat to up modestly.\"\nSwinburne added that a deceleration of ad revenue growth \"meaningfully reduces the company's ability to drive any operating leverage.\"\nPandora shares were up more than 7 percent a week into the new year, but shed more than 60 percent in 2017.\nSwinburne also cut his price target to $6 a share from $12. Pandora shares closed at $5.17 a share on Friday.\nâ€”CNBC's Michael Bloom contributed to this report.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-08T14:42:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-08T14:43:23.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
