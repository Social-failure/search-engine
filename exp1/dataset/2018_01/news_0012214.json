Based on the Fund’s December 29, 2017 share price of $19.38 per share, the distribution represents an annualized yield of 9.18% per share. Based on current projections through the payable date, the Fund expects that this distribution will be comprised of net investment income.\nIn addition, the Fund announced estimated monthly distributions of $0.1482 per share for February 2018 and March 2018. The distribution schedule appears below:\nMonth Ex-Date Record Date Payable Date Amount 1 January 01/22/2018 01/23/2018 02/01/2018 $0.1482 February 02/16/2018 02/20/2018 03/01/2018 $0.1482 March 03/20/2018 03/21/2018 04/02/2018 $0.1482 The Fund seeks to pay a distribution at a rate that reflects net investment income actually earned. A portion of each distribution may be treated as paid from sources other than net investment income, including but not limited to short-term capital gain, long-term capital gain or return of capital. The final determination of the source and tax characteristics of these distributions will depend upon the Fund’s investment experience during its fiscal year and will be made after the Fund’s year end. The Fund will send to investors a Form 1099-DIV for the calendar year that will define how to report these distributions for federal income tax purposes.\nThe Fund is a non-diversified, closed-end management investment company that is managed by Barings LLC. The Fund invests primarily in short-duration, global high yield bonds with the objective of seeking as high a level of current income as Barings determines is consistent with capital preservation, with a secondary objective of capital appreciation. The Fund expects to maintain a weighted average portfolio duration, including the effects of leverage, of 3 years or less.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-10T18:46:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-10T20:17:19.012+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
