Its needs have been growing very rapidly as car output has increased and emissions control legislation has got tighter,” he said. “On top of that you’ve had some degree of speculation and stock building.”\nHigher demand from the automotive sector - which uses palladium in catalytic converters, particularly in the gasoline-fuelled cars favoured in China - helped drive palladium prices up more than 50 percent last year, to a record $1,138 an ounce in January.\nPremiums in Hong Kong jumped from the third quarter, traders in the region said, hitting $12-$15 an ounce before easing back to $5-$6 currently. Lease rates for the metal, currently low single to double digit, reached as high as 25 percent.\nDealers in Hong Kong said that, with investment demand for palladium weak in the territory, metal was being bought for industrial use.\n“As the markets realised that people were buying (to meet) demand for gasoline cars, more metal was shipped to Hong Kong,” one trader based there said. “As prices rose people took deliveries and shipped it. The lease rates and interest rates in Hong Kong for palladium went up.”\n“The fact is that there is a shortage of the metal and people hoarded and keep hoarding palladium.”\nMetal moving east to Hong Kong is unlikely to be seen in the market for a long time, the trading source said. “The benefit of Hong Kong is that there is a lot of storage space here and it is out of the market,” he said. “Once it comes here it can be stored at a low cost for a very long period of time, and that’s what people are doing.”\nFund outflows have helped plug a physical deficit seen in palladium over the last decade, helping cut 2016’s near 1.5 million ounce physical deficit in half.\nHowever, those stocks are running low. Global palladium ETF holdings tracked by Reuters have more than halved since the end of 2014, and now account for just over six weeks’ worth of demand. Further depletion could have big price implications.\n“If that source of metal starts to dry up, whether because ETF stocks are getting low or because investors are holding onto the metal tighter, you need to find other routes for it to come into the market, and that typically occurs through higher prices,” ICBC Standard Bank analyst Tom Kendall said.\n“That incentivises scrap flow, maybe causes demand destruction, and over the longer term incentivises producers to get more out of the ground. The issue then is the time lag between prices rising and supply responding - you can have extended periods of quite high prices.”\nHigher prices destroy demand by pricing some buyers out of the market.\nAs palladium-backed ETFs were liquidated last year, net long positioning in Nymex palladium futures rose to a record as investors used the contracts to bet on higher prices. At the same time, Nymex palladium stocks slid to their lowest since 2003.\nWhile this is unlikely to cause a crisis, as few Nymex palladium holders take delivery of physical metal, it does flag up broader tightness.\n“Stocks falling and prices going up say to me you have a physical shortage,” Macquarie analyst Matthew Turner said. “ETF holdings coming down was the most bullish thing I saw all last year.”\nETF holdings and futures long positioning have gone in opposite directions because futures investors tend to have a shorter outlook than ETF buyers, who may have been holding the metal for longer and therefore have been better positioned to take profits, analysts said.\nThe backwardation in the palladium market also creates a positive ‘roll yield’ from investors selling a short-dated contract and buying a longer-dated one.\nReporting by Jan Harvey in London and Nallur Sethuramen in Bengaluru; Editing by Mark Potter\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-22T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-22T03:20:11.019+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
