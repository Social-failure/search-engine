As recently as 2005, there were 1,015 deaths aboard commercial passenger flights worldwide, the Aviation Safety Network said.\nThe United States last recorded a fatal airline passenger jet crash in February 2009, when Colgan Air Flight 3407 crashed short of the runway in Clarence Center, New York, killing 49 onboard and one person on the ground.\nIn 2016, 412 people were killed in the United States in aviation accidents â€” nearly all in general aviation accidents and none on commercial passenger airlines.\nThe last fatal passenger jet airliner accident worldwide took place in November 2016 near Medellin, Colombia and the last commercial passenger aircraft crash to kill more than 100 people occurred in October 2015 in Egypt.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-01T20:41:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-01T20:55:32.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
