Otherwise they will leave the battlefront and move back to Aden to assist President Hadi and the government,” the source said. \nThe two sides have traded accusations over who started the clashes on Sunday. \nSunday’s fighting broke out after the expiry of a deadline set last week by separatists from the STC for Hadi to dismiss the bin Daghr government, accusing it of corruption and mismanagement. The government denies this. \nBin Daghr has described the ultimatum as a coup against the internationally-recognised government, which the STC has accused of attacking civilians who had converged on the city’s Parades Square from across southern Yemen for a rally. \nNo details were given of casualties sustained on Monday but the Yemeni Health Ministry said 12 people had been killed in Sunday’s clashes and 132 wounded. \nFighting had subsided on Sunday evening after bin Daghr called for a truce and ordered government forces back to barracks, but the clashes have effectively divided the city into two zones controlled by the separatists and the government. \nAlthough Hadi remains in exile in Saudi Arabia, his administration and local allies nominally control about four-fifths of Yemen’s territory. \nThe factional fighting in the south compounds the misery of Yemenis whose country has been torn apart by three years of conflict between Hadi’s forces and the Houthis.
