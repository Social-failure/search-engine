It's not something we worry a lot about day by day,\" Ross argued.\nAfter Mnuchin spoke, the dollar index against a basket of major currencies hit its lowest level since December 2014.\nshow chapters Secretary Wilbur Ross: We're all in favor of open borders but it has to be a two-way street 7 Hours Ago | 09:26 Ross also told CNBC \"there's a good chance\" that U.S. efforts to renegotiate NAFTA will be successful.\nHowever, President Donald Trump has also repeatedly said he would pull out of NAFTA if he thought it would lead to a better deal for America.\nRoss has been a key player in the Trump administration's efforts to overhaul the 1994 North American Free Trade Agreement among the U.S., Canada, and Mexico. The 80-year-old billioniare said that remains so, despite an Axios report that Trump has lost confidence Ross' ability to negotiate trade deals. Ross said he still has the support of the president.\nBefore joining the White House, Ross made a fortune in the investment world, running W.L. Ross & Co., and buying stakes in distressed assets.\nTrump is set to depart for Davos Wednesday evening. He's expected to hold meetings with world leaders ahead of his address to the forum on Friday.
