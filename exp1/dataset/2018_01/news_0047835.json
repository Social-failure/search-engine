We condemn the experiments in the strongest terms. Even though Daimler did not have influence on the study’s design, we have launched a comprehensive investigation into the matter,” Daimler said in a statement on Sunday. \nThe New York Times on Friday said the scientific study involving monkeys was conducted in 2014. BMW, Daimler and VW have condemned the emissions experiments involving monkeys. \nThe New York Times said EUGT had commissioned a study to defend the use of diesel after the World Health Organisation said the fuel’s exhaust fumes were carcinogenic.
