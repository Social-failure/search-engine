Lebanon has an unresolved maritime border dispute with Israel over a triangular area of sea of around 860 sq km (330 square miles) that extends along the edge of three of the blocks.\n“Lieberman’s words about Block 9 are a threat to Lebanon and its right to sovereignty over its territorial waters,” Lebanese President Michel Aoun said on his official Twitter account.\nHariri said the country would take up the comments with the “relevant international bodies to affirm its right to act in its territorial waters”.\nIn a statement from his press office, Hariri said Lieberman’s words were “blatant provocation”.\nForeign Minister Gebran Bassil said he had sent a letter to the United Nations two weeks ago affirming Lebanon’s right to defend itself and its economic interests.\nEnergy Minister Cesar Abi Khalil said: “Lebanon will use all available methods to fend off the Israeli aggression that was announced today.”\nIsrael last went to war in Lebanon in 2006, against the Iran-backed Shi‘ite group Hezbollah.\nWith tensions rising anew, Lieberman, a far-rightist in Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s conservative coalition government, said Lebanon would “pay the full price” for any new Hezbollah attacks on Israel.\nRelated Coverage Hezbollah vows to defend Lebanon's 'oil and gas rights' He said that the Lebanese army was indistinguishable from Hezbollah and both were fair game in any future war. But he said Israel sought no war, adding: “We try to conduct ourselves determinedly and responsibly.”\nThe offshore exploration and production contracts are expected to be officially signed on Feb. 9, Abi Khalil said, allowing exploration to begin.\nLebanon is on the Levant Basin in the eastern Mediterranean where a number of big sub-sea gas fields have been discovered since 2009, including the Leviathan and Tamar fields located in Israeli waters near the disputed marine border with Lebanon.\nReporting by Lisa Barrington in Beirut and Dan Williams in Tel Aviv; Editing by Dale Hudson and Adrian Croft\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-31T16:33:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-31T16:48:16.026+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
