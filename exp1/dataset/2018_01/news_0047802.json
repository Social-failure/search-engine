The company has $375 million in debt. \nThe Wall Street Journal first reported the talks on Tuesday and that the company could be sold for around $500 million, citing people close to the negotiations. ( on.wsj.com/2Bop76v ) \nThe Weinstein Company has been looking for a buyer or rescue financing since late last year after accusations of sexual harassment against its former co-chairman, Harvey Weinstein. The company fired him in October following the allegations. \nIn November, Contreras-Sweet assembled a consortium of investors who offered $275 million for company. \nAnother source familiar with the talks told Reuters on Tuesday that the offer had been improved from the earlier one. \nEarlier in January, Killer Content Inc, the movie producer that has partnered with philanthropist Abigail Disney in a consortium vying to acquire the Weinstein Company, said a bankruptcy may be the best way forward for the company. \nLions Gate Entertainment Corp ( LGFa.N ) has also made an offer for some of the companyâ€™s assets, as has Qatar-owned film company Miramax, originally founded by Harvey Weinstein and his brother Bob Weinstein.
