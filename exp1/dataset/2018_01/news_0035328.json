With one exception: the legislative framework should be prepared for a foreign currency amnesty,” Kostin said.\nHe did not spell out what he meant by a foreign currency amnesty. Russian policymakers have discussed scrapping profit tax on funds repatriated from abroad, and waiving any penalties incurred because the money was held outside Russia’s tax jurisdiction.\nKostin said the new foreign currency amnesty mechanism could be set up before the finance ministry taps the Eurobond market.\nVTB, which acted as the organizer of sovereign Eurobonds in the past, will aim to organize the issue this year as well, Kostin said.\nThe finance ministry said late last year it would welcome foreign investors to buy the Eurobond and could consider increasing the amount of bonds on offer from the planned $3 billion if it sees strong demand for the papers.\nReporting by Katya Golubkova and Dmitry Antonov; Editing by Andrey Ostroukh\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-01-22T16:56:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-23T18:00:28.010+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
