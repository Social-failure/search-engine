(TSXV: EPI; NASDAQ: EPIX) (\" ESSA \" or the \" Company \") announced today that, further to its previously announced offering of equity securities, it has closed the second tranche of its brokered equity offering, raising an additional US$4 million from a fund managed by Omega Fund Management, LLC (\" Omega \") as well as the partial exercise by the Canadian agent of its over-allotment option for additional proceeds of approximately US$1 million (collectively, the \" Offering \"). Together with the initial closing on January 9, 2018 of the brokered equity offering and concurrent non-brokered private placement, the Company has raised total gross proceeds of approximately US$26 million.\nPursuant to the Offering, 14,500,000 common shares of the Company (\" Common Shares \") were issued, of which Omega acquired 9,300,000, representing approximately 8% of the issued and outstanding Common Shares, and Omega acquired 10,700,000 pre-funded common share purchase warrants of the Company (\" Warrants \", and together with the Common Shares, the \" Securities \") all at a price of US$0.20 per Security (the \" Offering Price \"). Each Warrant entitles Omega to acquire, for a nominal exercise price, one Common Share until 4:30 p.m. (Toronto time) on the date that is 60 months following its date of issuance. Assuming the exercise in full of the 10,700,000 Warrants and certain common share purchase warrants held by Omega prior to the Offering, Omega would own 22,303,029 Common Shares, representing approximately 17.6% of the issued and outstanding Common Shares, on a partially-diluted basis.\nEffective on the closing of the Offering, Hugo Beekman of Omega Fund Management, LLC, was appointed to the board of directors of the Company pursuant to the terms of a nomination rights agreement between ESSA and Omega. Under the terms of the nomination rights agreement, Omega is entitled to nominate one director to the board of directors of ESSA, who must meet ESSA's general criteria for directors, for so long as Omega holds at least 9.99% of the issued and outstanding Common Shares.\nThe Securities were issued pursuant to the terms and conditions of a second amended and restated agency agreement dated January 5, 2018 between the Company and a Canadian agent as the Company's sole agent for the Offering in Canada, with an exclusive U.S. placement agent being part of the selling group. The selling group was: (a) paid a cash commission equal to 7.0% of the gross proceeds of the Offering; and (b) issued broker warrants (the \" Broker Warrants \") representing 5.0% of the aggregate number of Common Shares and Warrants issued and sold under the Offering.\nThe Company intends to use the net proceeds of the Offering primarily to advance the preclinical and clinical development of the Company's next-generation Aniten compounds. The net proceeds will also be used for the interest and principal payments on the Company's outstanding debt and for working capital and general corporate purposes.\nThe Offering was completed in each of the provinces of British Columbia, Alberta and Ontario by way of a second amended and restated prospectus supplement dated January 5, 2018 to ESSA's base shelf prospectus dated December 22, 2015 (collectively, the \" Prospectus \") and elsewhere on a private placement basis.\nThe securities described herein have not been registered under the United States Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the \" U.S. Securities Act \"), or any state securities laws, and accordingly, may not be offered or sold to, or for the account or benefit of, persons in the United States or \"U.S. persons,\" as such term is defined in Regulation S promulgated under the U.S. Securities Act (\" U.S. Persons \"), except in compliance with the registration requirements of the U.S. Securities Act and applicable state securities requirements or pursuant to exemptions therefrom.
