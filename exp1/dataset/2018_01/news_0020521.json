Fairplane also saw a conflict of interest in appointing the same administrators for Niki and its German parent and debtor Air Berlin.\n“The main proceedings will take place in Austria,” the spokesman said, confirming an initial report by Austrian news agency APA.\nA German regional court earlier this week also said that Niki was under Austrian jurisdiction.
