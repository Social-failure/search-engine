The STOXX Europe 600 Chemicals slipped 0.3 percent. \n“The placement is to be offset by Covestro’s share buy-back,” said Raymond James analyst Patrick Lambert. \nUnder a scheme to gradually shed all Covestro stock, Bayer since last year has sold 6.5 billion euros worth of shares and also fetched 1 billion euros for bonds that it can pay back with Covestro shares. \nSeparately, it has relieved its pension obligations by transferring 8.9 percent in Covestro shares into Bayer’s pension trust. \nThe EU commission has until March 5 to complete its antitrust review of Bayer’s Monsanto deal and, if successful, Bayer is expected to launch the cash call shortly thereafter. \nBernstein analysts said in October they expect the capital increase to be in a range of 6-8 billion euros. $1 = 0.8373 euros Reporting by Ludwig Burger and Maria Sheahan; editing by Jason Neely", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-11T11:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-11T11:38:52.004+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
