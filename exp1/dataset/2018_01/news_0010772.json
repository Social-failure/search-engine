REUTERS/Kirill Kudryavtsev/Pool/File Photo \nMost astronauts “grow” during protracted space missions because their spines extend in the absence of gravity, but the gains are usually limited to a couple of centimeters (inches) maximum and disappear once they are back on the ground. \nThe 41-year-old Kanai, who went to space last month for a nearly six-month mission, posted on Twitter on Monday that he had “a big announcement.” \n“My height’s been measured here in space and somehow, somehow, I’ve grown 9 cm! In only three weeks I’ve really shot up, something I haven’t seen since high school,” he tweeted. \n“This makes me a little worried that I might not be able to fit in the Soyuz seats for our return.” \nBut a bit over a day later - and in the wake of a flurry of news stories - he apologized, saying that he’d measured himself after his captain raised questions about the apparent growth and he had stretched only 2 cm from his Earth-bound height. \n“This mis-measurement appears to have become a big deal, so I must apologize for this terrible fake news,” he tweeted, without explaining how the original miscalculation had occurred. \n“It appears I can fit on the Soyuz, so I‘m relieved.” Reporting by Elaine Lies; Editing by Michael Perry", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-10T05:18:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-10T05:40:58.004+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
