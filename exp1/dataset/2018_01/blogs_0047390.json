American Airlines declined 6 percent, while Delta Air Lines fell 5.2 percent and Southwest Airlines dropped 4.7 percent. \nUnited said it expects to increase annual capacity by 4 percent to 6 percent through 2020. This move could squeeze United's profit margins because it could lead other airlines down a similar path, forcing a drop in fares . \n\"We definitely understand management's decision to focus on improving their domestic network as the company admittedly shrunk too much post the Continental merger, but that was almost a decade ago and investors are likely to be somewhat frustrated by the company's aggressive growth rate,\" Cowen analyst Helane Becker said in a note Wednesday. \n\"The stock is unlikely to reflect the company's potential in the near-term as we anticipate competitive actions and investor concerns regarding overcapacity,\" Becker said. \nUnited also said it expected full-year earnings per share to range $6.50 to $8.50. Analysts polled by StreetAccount expected guidance of $6.99 per share. \nâ€”CNBC's Leslie Josephs contributed to this report.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-24T15:07:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-24T15:32:45.016+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
