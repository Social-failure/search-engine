This regime will be created by the Nuclear Safeguards Bill, which is currently in Parliament and recently passed its Commons Committee stage,” a spokeswoman said. \nExperts have said that if Britain leaves Euratom, there is a risk of new-build projects being delayed or put on hold while new stand-alone nuclear cooperation treaties are negotiated with countries in the EU and outside it. \nNuclear plants supply around 20 percent of Britain’s electricity and the government hopes a new fleet of plants, starting with EDF’s ( EDF.PA ) Hinkley Point C, will be built to help replace ageing coal and nuclear plants set to close in the 2020s. \n“Failure to replace (Euratom‘s) provisions by the point of withdrawal could result in the UK being unable to import nuclear materials, bringing the UK’s civil nuclear industry to a halt,” the report said.
