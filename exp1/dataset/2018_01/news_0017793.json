They have pleaded not guilty. \nIn Connecticut, prosecutors said Pearlman and sales representatives reporting to him induced medical practitioners to prescribe Subsys by paying them fees to participate in hundreds of speaker programs. \nThose programs ostensibly were meant to educate healthcare professionals about Subsys, yet they tended to be gatherings at restaurants of friends and co-workers who could not prescribe the product, prosecutors said. \nPearlman has pleaded not guilty to conspiring to violate the Anti-Kickback Statute. His trial is set for Feb. 7, though both sides recently requested to delay it by at least four months. \nInsys has said it is in settlement talks with the U.S. Justice Department and has estimated the minimum amount it may have to pay is $150 million. \n“We are committed to work with them very closely to put the investigations behind us and open a new chapter for the company,” Insys Chief Executive Saeed Motahari said at the J.P. Morgan Healthcare Conference in San Francisco on Thursday.
