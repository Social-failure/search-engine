(NYSE:RIG) announced today that the voluntary exchange offer (the “Offer”) by Transocean Ltd. and Transocean Inc. (collectively, \"Transocean\") to acquire all shares in Songa Offshore SE (\"Songa Offshore\"), expired on January 23, 2018 at 16:30 (CET), with a total of 175,720,167 Songa Offshore shares representing approximately 91.5% of the total shares in Songa Offshore on a fully diluted basis having accepted the Offer. The acceptance level is based on preliminary numbers and may be increased upon a final tabulation of shares tendered and accepted before the expiration of the Offer period.\nAccordingly, the condition for a minimum acceptance of at least 90% of the shares on a fully diluted basis has been met. The Offer is now unconditional.\nIn accordance with the terms and conditions of the Offer, transfer of the Songa Offshore shares tendered in the Offer and the delivery by Transocean of the Consideration Shares, Exchangeable Bonds and payment of cash consideration, as applicable, to Songa Offshore shareholders as settlement of the Offer, will be made as soon as reasonably possible (within 15 U.S. business days from January 23, 2018), and is expected to occur on or about January 30, 2018. It is expected that the Consideration Shares and Exchangeable Bonds to be issued in the Offer will be listed and begin trading on the New York Stock Exchange on or about the settlement date.\nUpon settlement of the Offer, Transocean will hold more than 90% of the shares in Songa Offshore and, therefore, Transocean intends to promptly initiate a compulsory acquisition of the remaining outstanding shares of Songa Offshore in accordance with the procedures set out in the combined prospectus and offer document and applicable laws. Transocean will propose that Songa Offshore is delisted from Oslo Stock Exchange as soon as practicable.\n***\nSteinhausen, January 23, 2018\nTransocean Ltd.\nTransocean Inc.\nA bout Transocean\nTransocean is a leading international provider of offshore contract drilling services for oil and gas wells.
