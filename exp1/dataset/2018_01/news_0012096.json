(formerly Arthur D. Little Consulting Group) in Los Angeles, responsible for the M&A and Joint Venture consulting firm's client acquisition, marketing activities, and relationship and engagement management.\nHe began his career in 1985 at Bloomingdales in Executive Development before moving to garment manufacturing.
