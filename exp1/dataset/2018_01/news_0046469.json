The central bank raised rates for the first time in more than a decade in November as it saw signs that wages would rise more quickly after falling behind inflation. \nCarney told the BBC that Brexit had cost Britain’s economy tens of billions of pounds in lower economic growth and companies had scaled back on their investment as they waited for more clarity on what Brexit means for them. \n“Investment in advanced economies is growing at double-digit rates, and it is low single digits here,” he said. \nCarney said he would not provide updated forecasts for Britain’s economy ahead of the BoE’s quarterly inflation report which is due to be published on Feb. 8.
