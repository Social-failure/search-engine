If anything, we remain of the view that the currency is trading in overbought territory,” said Credit Agricole currency strategists Manuel Oliveri.\nSterling traded flat at $1.3907 on Monday, close to Friday’s peak of $1.3945, its highest since the results of Britain’s vote to leave the European Union in June 2016.\nAlthough it is still down more than 7 percent since the day of the ballot, thee pound is now trading higher against the dollar than during a dip four months before the EU referendum, when the currency briefly touched as low as $1.3836.\nVersus the euro, however, which has strengthened across the board in recent months, sterling is still trading far lower than its pre-referendum levels and is down almost 14 percent since the day of the vote.\nThe pound was trading up 0.1 percent on the day at 88.08 pence per euro on Monday.\n“Euro strength has pulled the pound higher lately, pushing sterling/dollar to post-referendum highs,” wrote UBS Wealth Management strategists in a note to clients.\n“We expect this trend to continue, as the UK economy remains relatively solid. A strong U.S. dollar rebound remains unlikely, given the U.S.’s large trade and budget deficits, but rising U.S. interest rates should deliver some support to the dollar,” they added.\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron said on Saturday Britain would be able to have a bespoke deal with the European Union after Brexit, one of Prime Minister Theresa May’s objectives, though London’s financial centre could not enjoy the same level of access to the EU under May’s current Brexit plan.
