Soccer Football - Premier League - Tottenham Hotspur vs Everton - Wembley Stadium, London, Britain - January 13, 2018 Everton manager Sam Allardyce Action Images via Reuters/Matthew Childs \nGoals by midfielders Son Heung-min and Christian Eriksen on either side of a Harry Kane double handed ninth-placed Everton their third league defeat in a row. \nAllardyce suggested after the match that lessons had not been learnt from Everton’s 2-1 FA Cup defeat by Liverpool last week, a game that was settled by Virgil van Dijk’s late header. \n“Maybe I have to take the responsibility for playing too many attack-minded players... I should have gone back to being a bit more boring,” Allardyce said. \n”I reverted back to our Liverpool performance and thought if the team can play like that... surely you can come to Tottenham and deliver the same performance and maybe get a result. \n“It was a shock second-half performance. I saw some good signs of the players last week against Liverpool and I saw some of the worst signs in the second half today which is massively worrying... Obviously it’s something I have to address now.” \nEverton take on relegation-threatened West Bromwich Albion in the league next weekend. The Baggies secured their first top-flight win in 21 games with a 2-0 result against Brighton and Hove Albion on Saturday. \n“West Brom becomes a massive game next week so we don’t get dragged back into that relegation zone. After having a wonderful start we’re back in the danger zone. It’s our responsibility to get results and stay away from that,” Allardyce said.
