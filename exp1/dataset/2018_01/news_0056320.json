Pyotr Chekmarev, head of the agriculture ministry’s crop farming department, said the pitches could be targeted by locusts during the summer months.\n“One way or another, we have learnt how to deal with locusts, but how do we not fall into a global scandal with locusts this year?” he said at an agricultural event in Moscow.\n“The whole world is coming here. Football fields are green. Locusts love it where there is lots of green. How would they not come to the place where football is being played?”\nChekmarev said around a million hectares of land in southern Russia was infested with locusts, including around the World Cup host city of Volgograd.\nReporting by Olga Popova; Writing by Jack Stubbs; Editing by Andrew Osborn\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-31T17:29:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-31T17:49:45.041+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
