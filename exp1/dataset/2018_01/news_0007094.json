The king also ordered that government salaries be paid before electricity bills are issued each month.\nOn Jan.1, the government introduced a 5 percent value-added tax on goods and services, raised the price of electricity and reduced subsidies on gasoline, nearly doubling the price at the pump .\nA Twitter hashtag this week garnered thousands of tweets complaining that salaries are not enough to cover the cost of living. A similar hashtag a few years ago prompted the government to reverse a freeze on bonuses and government perks. Saudis opposed to the freeze had pointed to other energy-rich Gulf countries, like the United Arab Emirates and Qatar, where government salaries are much higher.\nThe government recently instituted a new welfare system reaching approximately 3 million families and 10.6 million beneficiariesâ€” or roughly half the Saudi population. Half of those families received the maximum payment of 938 riyals ($250). The minimum payment is 300 riyals ($80). The government expects to pay approximately 32 billion riyals ($8.5 billion) on the Citizen's Account payments in 2018.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-06T13:27:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-06T13:32:02.006+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
