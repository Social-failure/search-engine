Conservative groups and politicians have urged parliament to revise the national criminal code to criminalise same-sex relations.\nReporting and writing by Kanupriya Kapoor; Editing by Clarence Fernandez\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-30T12:36:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-30T12:53:16.002+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
