The shooting guard capped a 14-of-30 performance with a 13-footer with 89 seconds left and then made the game-winning 3-point play.\nAfter DeRozan scored his final points, Brooklyn guard Spencer Dinwiddie missed a layup in the final seconds.\nJonas Valanciunas added 21 points and 13 rebounds for the Raptors (28-10) who won for the 11th time in 13 games and beat the Nets for the 10th straight time. Point guard Kyle Lowry added 18 points and 11 assists for his 13th double-double but also was helped back to the locker room after taking a hard fall with about a minute left in overtime.\nDinwiddie scored 21 of his career-high 31 points after the third quarter for the Nets (15-25), who shot 39 percent and committed 16 turnovers. Dinwiddie also scored 10 points in the final 4:40 of regulation as the Nets overcame a 10-point deficit.\nAllen Crabbe added 20 points and hit four 3-pointers while Rondae Hollis-Jefferson posted a double-double with 14 points and a season-best 17 rebounds. Rookie Jarrett Allen added 14 points for Brooklyn, which played without DeMarre Carroll (right knee).\nValanciunas’ basket with 4:40 remaining gave the Raptors a 10-point lead, but Dinwiddie hit a 3-pointer with 40.3 seconds left to make it 107-105, and the Nets tied the game on Crabbe’s drive with nine seconds to play.\nThe game reached overtime when DeRozan missed a 23-footer at the buzzer.\nThe Nets took a 111-107 lead in the opening minute of the extra period on a dunk by Dinwiddie and a layup by Hollis-Jefferson before DeRozan scored the final five points for Toronto.\n--Field Level Media\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-01-09T11:54:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-09T17:11:01.002+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
