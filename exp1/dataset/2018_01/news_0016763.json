It also includes 220 convenience stores across South Africa and Botswana.\nGlencore stepped in after local shareholders, who hold the remaining 25 percent, exercised pre-emption rights following delays to the Sinopec deal.\n“Sinopec was thrown into a confusion after local shareholders exercised preemptive rights ... but then the company was advised by the government to proceed with regulatory procedures,” said a Beijing-based source with direct knowledge of the matter.\nA final decision from the Competition Tribunal was expected in March or April, the source said.\nSinopec has given additional commitments to the government, including investments over five years post acquisition to upgrade the Cape Town refinery into a world-class plant.\nThe Chinese firm also pledged to develop the fuel marketing business by introducing small and black-owned business as fuel retailers.\n“The South African competition committee was convinced that Sinopec has the solid industry expertise equipped with state-of-art refining technology, as well as financial power,” said the source.\nSinopec said it will also establish a development fund targetted at small and black-owned businesses thus increasing the level of local procurement of goods and services.\nGlencore’s bid was aimed at securing the trader its first refining asset since it ventured into downstream investments.\nThe remaining 25 percent stake will stay with a consortium of Black Economic Empowerment shareholders and an employee trust.\nWinning the deal would mark a second major refinery investment for Sinopec as the state oil major looks to expand overseas amid a saturated domestic market. Sinopec owns a stake in the Yanbu refinery in Saudi Arabia controlled by Saudi Aramco.
