I believe this is going to open the door to an inverted yield curve, wherein the longer-dated Treasuries carry a lower yield than those that are shorter-dated; this development is classically taken as a troubling signal for the broader market. \nIndeed, we have already seen a stunning flattening in the yield curve as measured by the spread between the 10-year and 2-year Treasury yields. Furthermore, the 10-year yield has failed to take its high from the first quarter of 2017, and the 30-year has remained even more contained in its moves. \nUltimately, these long periods of muted moves will lead to a mean reversion. As a futures trader, I watch the Treasury futures, which trade in prices (which move inversely to yields). At this point, I anticipate volatility will pick up in the coming months and that the 30-year Treasury prices will rally at a faster clip than the shorter-end — the 2- and 5-year Treasury yields. \nThink about it this way: As prices in the 30-year rise, the yields in the 30-year will sink. As the Federal Reserve tightens monetary policy, the shorter-dated bond yields will go through their own periods of containment. Theoretically, this should encourage the 30-year Treasury yield to fall beneath that of the 2- and 5-year. \nSo, how should investors position themselves if we are expecting this kind of price action across the bond market? \nInvestors ought to sell three 5-year Treasury futures contracts for every one 30-year Treasury futures contract bought.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-09T13:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-09T13:56:13.008+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
