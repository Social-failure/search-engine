For now, we’re far from reaching a deal,” Valdivia said in an interview.\nGlencore did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\nA 105-member union at Teck Resources Ltd’s ( TECKb.TO ) Quebrada Blanca mine walked off the job for a week last month.\nIn late November, workers at BHP’s ( BHP.AX ) Escondida mine, the world’s largest, also put down their tools for 24-hours following layoffs there.\nChile’s National Mining Society (Sonami) has said more than 30 pending negotiations over expiring workers’ contracts in 2018 could curb output if strikes continue to hit the sector.\nLomas Bayas produced 67,000 tonnes of copper between January and October of 2017.\nReporting by Antonio De la Jara, writing by Dave Sherwood; Editing by Andrew Hay\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-01-04T21:52:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-04T21:15:35.011+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
