It’s very, very tough. And yet they send their product to us - no taxes, very little taxes. It’s very unfair. \n“They’re not the only one, by the way. I could name many countries and places that do. But the European Union has been very, very unfair to the United States. And I think it will turn out to be very much to their detriment.” \n(This version of the story has been refiled to fix typo in paragraph four) Reporting By Andrew MacAskill; Editing by Jon Boyle", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-28T22:04:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-28T22:13:23.003+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
