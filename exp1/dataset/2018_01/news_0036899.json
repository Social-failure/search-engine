He says these students do so out of a “fundamental commitment to racial equality.”\nThen there’s Bret Weinstein, who resigned from Evergreen State College in June, and identifies himself as a progressive. He thinks social justice activists, who are blocking conservative speakers, are influenced by the postmodernist world view.\nWe also visit with University of California at Berkeley student organizer Gaelan Ash, who explains why he thinks people like Steve Bannon should be banned from speaking on college campuses.\nWrite to Jason Bellini at jason.bellini@wsj.com\nCorrection\nThe first name of Gaelan Ash was incorrectly given as Gilean in an earlier version of this article.
