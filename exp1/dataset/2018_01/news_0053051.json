By creating an illusion of demand, spoofers can influence prices to benefit their market positions. \nSpoofing is a criminal offence under a provision implemented as part of the 2010 Dodd-Frank financial reform.

REUTERS/Kai Pfaffenbach \nThe settlement is the most high-profile brought so far by the CFTC’s head of enforcement James McDonald who was appointed to the role in March 2017. \nMcDonald, who was previously a prosecutor in the Southern District of New York, said in September he plans to encourage companies and staff to report their own wrongdoing and cooperate with investigators, a strategy he hopes will make it easier to prosecute more individuals. \nIn August, a U.S. appeals court upheld the conviction of former New Jersey-based high-speed trader Michael Coscia who was the first individual was the first person to be criminally prosecuted for the manipulative trading practice. \nA spokeswoman for the CBOE, one of the U.S.’s major futures exchanges, declined to comment. A spokeswoman for the CME Group, the other major futures bourse, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
