Eastern Ghouta is the last major rebel position close to the capital.\nThe health directorate for opposition-held areas in the Damascus region said patient symptoms “suggest they have been exposed to chlorine gas inhalation”.\nIt said patients said the smell around the attack site resembled chlorine.\nThe Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, quoting local medical and other sources, said “gasses” released during a dawn rocket attack on Douma city caused “cases of suffocation”.\nThe Observatory said a gas was also used during a rocket attack last week on the enclave.\nA witness in the area said people had fled the area of the attack and were receiving treatment for breathing problems at medical centres.\nIn the past two years, a joint U.N. and the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) inquiry has found the Syrian government used the nerve agent sarin and has also several times used chlorine as a weapon.\nIt has also said Islamic State has used sulfur mustard.\nReporting by Lisa Barrington; Editing by Toby Chopra\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-22T12:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-22T12:21:05.006+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
