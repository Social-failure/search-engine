The S&P 500 .SPX lost 30.64 points, or 1.07 percent, to 2,822.89 and the Nasdaq Composite .IXIC dropped 72.40 points, or 0.97 percent, to 7,394.10. \nThe pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index .FTEU3 closed down 0.83 percent and MSCI's gauge of stock performance in 47 countries around the globe .MIWD PUS shed 0.95 percent. \nBenchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury notes US10YT=RR fell 4/32 in price to yield 2.7142 percent. \nGermany’s 10-year bond DE10YT=RR fell to 0.68 percent, down about 1 basis point on the day. After going positive for the first time since late 2015 on Monday, five-year German bond DE5YT=RR yields slipped back into negative territory. \nThe dollar reversed Monday’s gains. After six straight weekly declines, the dollar index was on track to fall about 3.4 percent for the month, which would be its biggest monthly fall since March 2016. \nThe dollar index .DXY fell 0.15 percent, with the euro EUR= up 0.16 percent to $1.2401. The Japanese yen strengthened 0.17 percent versus the greenback at 108.79 per dollar JPY= . \nBrent crude futures LCOc1 settled down 44 cents to $69.02 a barrel, while West Texas Intermediate futures CLc1 slid $1.06 to settle at $64.50. \nExpectations for U.S. crude inventories to rise   11 weeks may also be keeping oil under pressure, according to a preliminary poll by Reuters on Monday. [EIA/S]USOILC=ECI \n“The global trend seems to be indicating more oil is coming into the market despite best efforts by the Saudis and Russians to curtail output,” said John Kilduff, partner at Again Capital LLC in New York. \nGold slipped back to a one-week low. \nU.S. gold futures GCcv1 for February delivery settled down $4.90 at $1,335.40 per ounce.
