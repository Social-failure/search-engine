But most of all it is sustainable because it saves resources,” Tchibo said.\nTchibo, owned by the German billionaire Herz family, said charges would depend on the item of clothing. Renting a children’s jacket, for instance, might cost 4 euros ($4.84) a month and a t-shirt 2 euros, it said.\n$1 = 0.8256 euros Reporting by Maria Sheahan; Editing by Edmund Blair\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-01-12T17:29:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-13T14:39:41.047+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
