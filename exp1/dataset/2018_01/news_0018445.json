Europe’s accelerated review is similar, cutting the timeframe to 150 days from 210. \nKymriah belongs to a new class of treatments called CAR-T therapies where disease-fighting T cells are removed from a patient and genetically modified to better recognize and attack cancer. They are then re-infused into the same patient where they can circulate for years to seek out and fight the disease. \nNovartis expects Kymriah will eventually top $1 billion in annual sales as it expands the patient pool eligible for the therapy, which for young patients with ALL costs $475,000 per treatment. \nThere is growing competition in the CAR-T space, with Gilead’s similar Yescarta approved for aggressive refractory adult lymphoma last October. \n“The Priority Review designation and accelerated assessment signal that the FDA and EMA have recognized the potential of Kymriah to provide a much-needed therapeutic option for these patients,” said Samit Hirawat, who heads up Novartis Oncology Global Drug Development. \n“We are now focused on working with these regulatory agencies to bring this potentially transformative therapy to more patients.” Reporting by John Miller, editing by John Revill and Adrian Croft", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-17T08:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-17T08:42:41.002+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
