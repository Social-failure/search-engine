The route is widely used to transport Uzbek workers to and from Russia where they often take work on building sites. \nOnly five people managed to escape the burning vehicle, the interior ministry’s emergencies department said in a statement.

It said senior government officials would investigate the matter. \nA photograph posted online from the site showed the bus completely burnt out. Video footage also posted on the Web showed it positioned diagonally across a two-lane freeway in the middle of a snow-covered steppe, in flames and emitting heavy black smoke.
