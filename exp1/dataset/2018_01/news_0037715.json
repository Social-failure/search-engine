Two weeks ago hundreds of people were trapped overnight in a train in northern Japan due to heavy snow. \nNHK national broadcaster issued detailed recommendations for coping with the weather, including wearing boots with heavy treads, heading home early and not walking with hands in coat pockets in case of slips and falls. \n“All the government offices are staying in close contact, gathering information and responding based on various scenarios,” Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga told a news conference. “We call on all citizens to keep informed about the latest conditions and beware of transport delays.” Reporting by Kaori Kaneko and Elaine Lies, writing by Elaine Lies,", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-22T06:02:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-22T06:13:07.009+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
