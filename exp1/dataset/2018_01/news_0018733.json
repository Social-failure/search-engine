Escher said Koch, who embalmed and dismembered bodies, pulled teeth from some of the corpses to extract the gold in crowns or fillings.\n“She showed me her collection of gold teeth one day,” said Escher, who helped manage a former cremation-marketing business owned by Hess.\nKoch said “she had sold a different batch a year prior, and they took the whole family to Disneyland in California on the gold that they cashed in,” Escher said.\nReached by phone at Sunset Mesa, Koch said she did not wish to talk with a Reuters reporter. “I’m not interested. Thank you,” she said before ending the call.\nThe news agency had also sent written questions to Hess and her attorney about Koch’s alleged handling of gold teeth. Neither addressed the issue about the teeth.\nNo federal law prohibits the buying and selling of human body parts to be used in research and education.\nIn Colorado and most other states, it also is legal for funeral homes to sell items recovered from dead bodies, such as gold dental work. And it is not against the law to operate a so-called body broker firm from the same facility that houses a funeral home and crematory.\nBut the business arrangement is highly unusual. Reuters could find no other operation active in the United States that houses a funeral home, crematory and body broker in the same facility and under the same ownership.\nSuch multipurpose operations raise ethical concerns, several funeral industry veterans said. A funeral director who also works as a body broker could have a financial incentive to sell a body for its valuable parts rather than provide an inexpensive burial, for instance.\n“The conflict of interest of having a side business in body parts just leads to problems,” said Steve Palmer, a funeral director in Cottonwood, Arizona, and former member of the policy board at the National Funeral Directors Association. “There are no ethics there when you do that. You are not looking at the full disposition (of a body). You are looking at how to make money.”\nHess runs Sunset Mesa, a funeral home, and Donor Services, a body broker operation from the same building in Montrose. Some former staff members of Sunset Mesa said they never heard Hess disclose to donors that the bodies would be sold for profit.\n“The fact that now the business is also making money from the sale of body parts – if that is not being told to the family, it is unethical and probably illegal, if only as deception,” said Robert Fells, general counsel of the International Cemetery, Cremation and Funeral Association, an industry trade group. Fells called running such a multifaceted operation “a new frontier.”\nThrough the attorney, Hess declined to comment for this story and didn’t address questions about the FBI probe, her business practices, and the allegations by former employees. The attorney, Carol Viner, asked Reuters to “refrain from contacting” Hess employees “for any reason.”\nThe focus and extent of the federal probe into the Hess operation is unclear, and the FBI also declined to comment.\nSeparate from the FBI inquiry, Reuters has learned that Colorado state funeral regulators are investigating Hess’s funeral home, Sunset Mesa. The state’s Department of Regulatory Agencies said it has nine open complaints about Sunset Mesa – “higher than average” for funeral homes in the state, said spokesman Lee Rasizer. He would not discuss the nature of those complaints or any action it may be taking.\nReuters began examining the Hess companies more than a year ago as part of the news agency’s exploration of the human body trade, a virtually unregulated industry that largely operates in the shadows.\n“ADD TO CART” Before referring questions to a lawyer, Hess spoke extensively with Reuters about her body broker company. In an interview in 2016, she described Donor Services as a small, family business. She took orders for body parts via Hotmail, email records show. She said she and her mother, Koch, handled about 10 cadavers a month in the back room. Her father, Alan Koch, ran the crematory, Hess said.\nHess made donating a body online easy. On her cremation marketing website, a donor could simply select from a drop-down menu, fill out a few forms, click “Add to Cart,” and enter a credit card number. Her funeral home site listed her credentials, including a PhD in mortuary science.\nAfter a reporter asked questions about the website and her background, Hess removed the “Add to Cart” donation pages from her cremation website and cut the mention of the mortuary science degree from her online biography. No such degree exists in the United States for morticians, veteran funeral directors say. Her revised online biography cited her high school degree and “a love of veterinary medicine.”\nWhen Reuters visited her facility in 2016, Hess said Donor Services represented just 15 percent or so of her total business. But it provided an important public service, she said.\n“It’s for the good of the world, and I like to help people,” Hess said.\nBody brokers like Donor Services are also known as non-transplant tissue banks. They are distinct from the organ and tissue transplant industry, which the U.S. government closely regulates. Suppliers of transplant tissue must obtain federal recognition and operate as charities. It is illegal to buy or sell organs such as hearts, kidneys and tendons for transplant.\nBut no federal law governs the sale of cadavers or body parts for use in research or education. Few state laws provide any oversight. That means almost anyone, regardless of expertise, can dissect and sell human remains.\nReuters identified 34 body brokers that have been active across the United States during the past five years. Twenty-five of the brokers were for-profit corporations. The other nine were structured as nonprofits, including Donor Services – the only broker Reuters could find that still doubles as a funeral home.\nColorado does not regulate body brokers. It is also the only state that doesn’t license funeral directors. Funeral homes are required to register with the state, but spokesman Rasizer said the regulatory affairs department is not authorized to inspect mortuaries. It only investigates a funeral home if a complaint is filed, he said.\nAt Sunset Mesa, Hess charged $1,995 for a simple burial and $695 for a basic cremation, according to price lists reviewed by Reuters. Extra charges are assessed if a body is embalmed or a funeral director is involved.\nKari Escher, former manager at Sunset Funeral Directors, poses for a portrait in Montrose, Colorado, U.S., December 17, 2017.
