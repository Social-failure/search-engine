The northwestern province is the largest region still held by rebels driven out of other strongholds in Syria, and is home to more than 2 million people, many in need of aid.\n“Carrying out increased attacks in Idlib will cause new migration waves and victimization there. This is very dangerous and wrong,” Yildirim told reporters after Friday prayers.\nTurkey has been deploying forces inside northern Idlib and setting up bases there after agreeing with Iran and Russia to establish a “de-escalation zone” in Idlib and nearby areas.\n“It is very wrong for the Assad regime to launch an offensive, without differentiating civilians, in order to gain land ... while the initiative by Turkey, Russia and Iran on a lasting peace in Syria has made progress,” Yildirim said.\n“We are discussing this issue with Russia and Iran, we are making our warnings regarding the potentially horrible ramifications of Assad’s attacks,” he said, warning that the fighting was hindering efforts to reach a political solution.\nRussia aims to convene a Syria peace congress later this month, though it is not yet clear who will attend.\nOn Thursday, rebels launched a counter attack against government forces and their allies in Idlib province.\nReporting by Dominic Evans and Tuvan Gumrukcu; Editing by David Dolan\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-12T13:57:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-12T14:18:56.030+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
