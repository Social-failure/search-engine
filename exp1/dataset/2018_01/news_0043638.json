Amster was succeeded as CEO by the company’s general counsel Martin Roberts.\nRPX has now hired an investment bank to run a sale process for the company, which has attracted interest from private equity firms, the sources said this week. There is no certainty that RPX will agree to any deal, the sources added.\nThe sources asked not to be identified because the deliberations are confidential. RPX did not respond to a request for comment.\nRPX shares rose as much as 11 percent on the news and ended trading at up 3.0 percent at $13.93 on Wednesday, giving the company a market capitalization of $650 million.\nBased in San Francisco, RPX is one of the largest buyers of patents, having spent more than $3.5 billion to buy more than 18,500 patent assets to date.\nCompanies concerned about the cost of patent litigation pay subscription fees to join RPX’s network, which then shields them from lawsuits on these patents. RPX also provide patent litigation insurance, as well as market intelligence on patents.\nThe company been looking for ways to boost its relatively flat earnings. RPX reported total revenue of $85.7 million for the third quarter of 2017, compared to $88.5 million in the third quarter of 2016. Adjusted net income was $10.9 million versus $12.7 million a year ago.\n(This version of the story was refiled to add the dropped word ‘down’ in paragraph two)\nReporting by Liana B.
