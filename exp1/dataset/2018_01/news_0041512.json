JPMorgan and Goldman Sachs rose more than 1 percent.\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 63.55 points, or 0.24 percent, to 26,274.36, the S&P 500 gained 3.17 points, or 0.11 percent, to 2,842.3 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 24.34 points, or 0.33 percent, to 7,435.95.\nEarnings season continues to come in strong, with S&P 500 growth expected at 12.4 percent, according to Thomson Reuters data through Wednesday morning. Of the 88 companies in the index that have posted results, 78.4 percent have topped expectations versus the 72 percent beat rate for the past four quarters.\nAmong those posting results, General Electric fell 2.34 percent after the company revealed a regulatory investigation of a multibillion-dollar insurance charge.\nThe company in its earnings report forecast further weakening of its troubled power business and reported a $10 billion loss and a 5-percent fall in revenue.\nAbbott Laboratories jumped 4.37 percent after quarterly profit and 2018 adjusted earnings forecast beat estimates.\nSemiconductor stocks were off 2.07 percent and pulled the Nasdaq lower as Texas Instruments slumped 8.03 percent after it posted the slowest revenue growth in four quarters on softer demand for its chips used in communications equipment.\nDeclining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by a 1.21-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.68-to-1 ratio favored decliners.\nThe S&P 500 posted 141 new 52-week highs and one new low; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 183 new highs and 12 new lows.
