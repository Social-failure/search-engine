Compared to a year earlier, the loan book grew more than 6 percent, driven by roughly 20 percent growth in credit to individuals.\nLoan-loss provisions totaled 2.6 billion reais in the quarter, down 0.9 percent from a year earlier. Santander Brasil’s 90-day loan delinquency ratio rose 0.3 percentage point to 3.2 percent in the quarter due to a single, undisclosed corporate client.\n$1 = 3.18 reais Reporting by Carolina Mandl; Editing by David Gregorio and Sandra Maler\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-31T00:44:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-31T01:10:25.007+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
