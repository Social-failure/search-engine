We have a technology called Einstein.\"\nBenioff said that after he has worked around his room of executives he then quizzes his AI assistant. \"I ask Einstein, 'I heard what everybody said but what do you actually think?'\"\nThe Salesforce boss said he has been using the technology for a year now, and recently Einstein questioned the reports of one European employee.\n\"And Einstein said, 'Well, I don't think this executive is going to make their number, I'm so sorry.'\"\nBenioff said the executive was visibly upset by the claim but after Einstein had processed all the data, the AI machine was able to identify the problems in real time.\n\"And I could say, 'Well, you've got this problem, and this person hasn't got that in place, and you didn't do this over here.'\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-25T11:49:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-25T12:38:29.007+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
