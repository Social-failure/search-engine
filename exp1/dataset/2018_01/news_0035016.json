Bacardi is now buying full control with plans to distribute the Mexican-made liquor more widely and cash in on demand for high-end tequila, they added. \nThe two privately held companies are expected to announce the transaction as soon as Monday, the people said. \nOver the last decade, global liquor makers have tried to adjust their portfolios to keep up with changing consumer tastes, especially as overall volumes fall and drinkers shift away from beer, vodka and rum. As part of that effort, producers have tried to change tequila from an inexpensive party drink to a more refined spirit comparable to a single-malt Scotch.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-22T23:52:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-22T23:56:24.004+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
