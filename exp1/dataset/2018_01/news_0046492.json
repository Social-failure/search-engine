The effectiveness of the city’s drainage systems came under fire after an Aug. 5 storm dumped up to 6 inches (15 cm) of rain, causing street flooding and underpasses to fill up.\nFILE PHOTO: Revellers throw beads from a French Quarter balcony on Mardi Gras Day in New Orleans, Louisiana, U.S., March 4, 2014. REUTERS/Jonathan Bachman/File Photo The clean-up effort between late September and late January cleared about 15,000 of the city’s estimated 68,000 storm drains, the newspaper reported. The Mardi Gras beads were found along the St. Charles Avenue parade route.\nMardi Gras is celebrated on Shrove Tuesday, the day before Ash Wednesday, which is the beginning of Lent, a period of reflection and abstinence on the Catholic calendar.\nBy tradition, Mardi Gras, which is French for “Fat Tuesday,” is a day that calls for excessive partying in preparation for the somber season of sacrifice to follow.\nMardi Gras falls on Feb. 13 this year.\nPartygoers are known to wear and toss beads - known as “throws” in New Orleans - from the streets and balconies in the French Quarter, Bourbon Street and other areas where partiers jostle through crowds.\nAt the news conference, Galloway asked residents to help clear catch basins and said the department was considering preventative methods, such as temporarily installing “gutter buddies” to keep the carnival beads from rolling down the drain.\nReporting by Gina Cherelus in New York; editing by Colleen Jenkins and G Crosse\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-26T21:24:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-26T21:37:26.011+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
