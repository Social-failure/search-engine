They can appeal.\nThe Giza misdemeanor court also fined the owner of the building, a Christian man, 360,000 Egyptian pounds ($20,500) for turning his residency into a church without a license.\nDozens of Muslims from the village of Kafr al-Waslin attacked the church after Friday prayers on Dec. 22, smashing windows and breaking everything inside.\nThe Archdiocese of Atfih had applied to legalize the church, which housed worshippers for 15 years after a church building law was passed in 2016.\nChristians in Egypt have long complained of discrimination in the majority-Muslim country and have increasingly come under attack in recent years.\nEgyptian authorities are also battling a stubborn Islamist insurgency, mostly concentrated in the remote Sinai Peninsula, which has claimed several attacks on Egyptâ€™s large Christian minority.\nReporting by Haitham Ahmed; Writing by Arwa Gaballa; Editing by Janet Lawrence\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-31T15:33:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-31T15:48:34.017+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
