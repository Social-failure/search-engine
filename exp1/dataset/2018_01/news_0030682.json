The government will focus its efforts on prosecuting people who participated in “identifiable acts” of violence, according to the filing. \nProsecutors have contended that the protesters were part of the group that became violent during the Inauguration Day protests. Those protests were far smaller than the Women’s March the following day, in which hundreds of thousands of people poured into several major U.S. cities, including Washington. Reporting by Sarah N.
