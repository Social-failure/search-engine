Between 5-10 percent of patients with breast cancer have a BRCA mutation.\nReporting by Toni Clarke in Washington; Editing by Nick Zieminski\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-01-12T22:57:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-13T14:52:36.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
