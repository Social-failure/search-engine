There’s still a gap, inventories are still high. The inventory level will decrease gradually and we will see how things will go,” he told reporters.\nLuaibi also said that his ministry plans to conclude three contracts with international gas companies by mid-2018 to utilize gas from Basra, Maysan and Nassiriyah southern provinces.\nHe said that by 2021, the country plans to “reach zero gas flaring”.\nIraq is forced to flare some of the gas produced alongside crude oil as it lacks the facilities needed to capture and process it into usable fuel.\nThe country has just one gas processing company, the Basrah Gas Company, a joint venture between Iraq’s state-run South Gas Co., Shell and Mitsubishi.\nOPEC’s second-largest crude producer after Saudi Arabia, Iraq is seeking to increase its oil and gas income, which account for nearly all its public budget.\nWriting by Rania El Gamal; Editing by Alexander Smith\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-01-13T19:40:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-13T14:32:18.021+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
