Never easy to feel that way on the court,” he said.\nTennis - Australian Open - Margaret Court Arena, Melbourne, Australia, January 18, 2018.

I think the last 12 days was more than what I could have dreamed coming here.\n“Even today my knee was feeling way better than two days ago. If I look the big picture, I know it’s really positive.”\nSandgren, who needed career-saving hip surgery in 2013 and has spent his career on the Challenger and Futures tours, claimed his first grand slam singles win against Frenchman Jeremy Chardy in the first round.\nNow, with world number 94 Maximilian Marterer of Germany next to play, he has a great chance to reach the fourth round and is already guaranteed his biggest pay check of A$142,500 ($114,000) for reaching the third round.\nInevitably, the on-court interviewer could not resist calling his win a “good day for Tennys”.\n”I was really happy to get my first grand slam win here, and now I’ve got my second. I’ll go for the third one and give my best,“ he said. ”I was definitely aptly named.\n“It was my great-grandfather’s name. I had to be at least half decent at the sport. I think I’ve done that.”\n($1 = 1.2509 Australian dollars)\nReporting by Martyn Herman; Editing by Pritha Sarkar\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-01-18T19:20:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-19T12:35:56.010+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
