Their first goal should have been disallowed. They will have to explain this one as well.

It’s gone wrong for the umpteenth time... The images speak for themselves.” \nGattuso commented: “I thought he scored with his head but, looking at it again, I have seen that it was an irregular goal. But I don’t think it does us justice to talk about just one episode.” \nFootball’s law-making body IFAB is expected to decide in March whether to authorise the use of VAR on a permanent basis. Global soccer body FIFA has said on various occasions that it wants to use the system at the World Cup in Russia this year.
