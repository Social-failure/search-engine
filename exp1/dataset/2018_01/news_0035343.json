The three men are on trial alongside Percoco and have pleaded not guilty. \nCuomo, a Democrat who is up for reelection this year, has not been charged with wrongdoing. \nBoone said Kelly bribed Percoco by giving his wife, Lisa, a mostly no-show job that paid $90,000 per year for three years to win favorable treatment from state officials for two power plant projects. \nHe said Aiello and Gerardi paid bribes through shell companies to get favorable treatment for development of a parking lot. \nBoone said the trial would feature testimony from another former Cuomo aide, Todd Howe, who has pleaded guilty and is cooperating with prosecutors. \nBohrer told jurors that Howe would lie in an effort to secure a lighter sentence for himself. \nLawyers for Kelly, Aiello and Gerardi also said their clients’ dealings with Percoco were legitimate, and that Howe was not credible. \nAiello and Gerardi are expected to face a second trial on separate charges that they took part in a bid-rigging scheme involving a billion-dollar development project in Buffalo, New York. \nThe convictions of Silver and Skelos were overturned by a federal appeals court, and both cases are expected to go to trial a second time.
