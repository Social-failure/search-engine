Staff affected in the banking division were told last week, and staff affected in trading are expected to be told this week. Some could move to new roles elsewhere in the bank.\nCharlie Berman, chairman of EMEA debt capital markets, was one of the more high-profile names put at risk, people with knowledge of the situation said.\nLongstanding UK corporate debt originator Jeremy Froud, one of the few Barclays bankers to have joined the firm when it was called BZW over 20 years ago, could also be let go, while Simon Ollerenshaw, who has worked at Barclays for 10 years, could move from DCM to another area.\nPeople have told IFR the cuts are, so far, heavier in Europe with the more profitable US business less affected.\nThere is no shift in strategy, which has seen Tim Throsby, who took the helm of Barclays International (which includes the corporate and investment bank) at the start of last year, try to squeeze costs, improve capital efficiency, but also make selective hires in areas where he sees potential to increase revenues and improve returns.\nPeople previously told IFR there were be cuts in other areas of Barclays as part of the squeeze, and areas such as investor relations could be affected.\nBarclays last week appointed Kathryn McLeland as group treasurer as well as head of investor relations as part of an internal reorganisation to streamline functions under finance director functions, people close to the matter said.\nDan Hodge, who has run treasury for the past four years, is now considering another role within the bank, the people said.\nMcLeland has run investor relations for five years after spending 11 years in Barclays’ investment bank, within its team that deals with financial institutions.\nRETURNS PUSH Treasurers deal with financing and liquidity, and have taken on greater importance as tougher capital, liquidity and reporting regulations have been introduced in recent years.\nBarclays and other UK banks are also in the process of a complex restructuring that requires “ring-fencing” their UK retail banking operations.\nBarclays has been trying to cut costs for several years in an effort to get returns back above its cost of equity. That is being helped by greater automation of back-office functions, and Barclays said in October it planned to step up investment in its trading platforms.\nThe bank axed 20,000 staff from the start of 2014 to the end of 2016, leaving it with 119,300 at the end of 2016. That included a net reduction of 10,000 staff in 2016 alone. It is due to release full-year results, including headcount changes for 2017, on February 22.
