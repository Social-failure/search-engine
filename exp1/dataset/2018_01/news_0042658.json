Jonathon Simmons had six points and Elfrid Payton five in the pull-away.\nThe Kings creeped within 82-77 by the third quarter’s end, then went ahead 94-93 with 5:15 to go after back-to-back 3-pointers by Temple.\nSacramento took the lead for good, 99-97, on another Temple 3-pointer with 2:42 remaining. He added an 18-footer with 1:31 to go and two free throws with 23 seconds left to ice the win.\nThe Magic did not score from the 3:58 mark until Payton made a meaningless layup at the final horn.\nWillie Cauley-Stein had 21 points and nine rebounds, Buddy Hield added 13 points, and Skal Labissiere contributed 10 points and nine rebounds for the Kings, who had begun a six-game trip with losses to the Memphis Grizzlies and the Charlotte Hornets.\nPayton had a game-high seven assists to complement 21 points, and Aaron Gordon pulled down a game-high 12 rebounds to go with 16 points for the Magic, which is now tied with Sacramento for the fewest wins in the NBA with 14.\nFournier scored nine of his 22 points in a 16-4 first-quarter run that allowed the Magic to overcome an early seven-point deficit.\n--Field Level Media\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-01-24T10:50:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-24T15:47:33.001+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
