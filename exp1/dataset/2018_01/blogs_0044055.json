There will be a handful or two handfuls in the mid to more distant future,” Helmrich said, comparing the proliferation of industrial software platforms with the smartphone industry, which has ended up being dominated by Apple and Samsung.\nMindSphere gathers data from devices, then uses it to help customers design products faster and optimize processes. Last month Siemens said it is partnering with Amazon Web Services (AWS), the most popular cloud provider.\nSiemens already has more than 800,000 intelligent sensors in buildings and machines, including trains and healthcare equipment, putting it in a strong position, Helmrich said.\n“It is a solid basis for the start of the business and makes us optimistic about scale effects,” he said, adding that being first to gather a critical mass of software developers and users is crucial to winning customers, much as Apple’s large developer community made its app store the most attractive.\nSiemens on Wednesday launched a user organization with 18 partners including German robotics firm Kuka and factory developer Eisenmann to help them develop the platform and set out rules for data use.\n(This version of the story corrects the title of Siemens executive in first paragraph)\nReporting by Emma Thomasson; editing by Alexander Smith\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-24T19:03:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-24T19:31:46.023+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
