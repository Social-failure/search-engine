She is the first foreign woman to be sentenced to death in Iraq for joining the militant group. \nShe can appeal the sentence, said Abdul-Sattar al-Birqdar, spokesman for Iraq’s Supreme Judicial Council in Baghdad. \n“She confessed that she travelled with her two daughters from Germany to Syria and then joined Daesh in Iraq,” Birqdar said, referring to Islamic State by an Arabic acronym. \nThe woman was convicted of participating in attacks on Iraqi security forces and offering the militant group logistical support, said Birqdar. \nA German foreign ministry spokeswoman declined to comment. \nThousands of foreigners have been fighting for Islamic State in Iraq and Syria. \nA Russian Islamic State fighter was sentenced to death in Iraq last year for joining the hardline group. \nIraq declared victory last month over Islamic State, which had seized control of nearly a third of the country in 2014. However, IS continues to carry out bombings and other attacks in the country.
