Lahar from Mayon can carry huge boulder and it can bury communities, wash away people and everything in its path, but also because of impact.”\nResidents wade thorugh a river with lahar flow from Mount Mayon volcano in Daraga, Albay province, south of Manila, Philippines January 27, 2018. REUTERS/Romeo Ranoco She said boulders as huge as cars and houses could roll down Mayon’s slopes swiftly in minutes.\nHeavy rains poured in central Philippines, flooding shelter areas and raising risks of lahar flows.\nSlideshow (8 Images) In Salvacion village, many farmers were sneaking inside the danger zone to plant and look after farm animals saying they need to earn a living.\n“I don’t think the volcano will erupt,” Istong Jayvee told Reuters. “It already let out fire. It will quiet down soon.”\nFarm worker Edna Medina said they are ready anytime to flee when the volcano erupts.\n”When the volcano does erupt, we’ll get out of here using our motorcycle then head straight for the main road out,” she added.\nVolcanologists have raised Mayon’s alert to level 4, one notch below the highest level.\nReporting by Ronn Bautista Writing by Manuel Mogato Editing by Jeremy Gaunt.\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-27T14:05:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-27T14:25:50.025+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
