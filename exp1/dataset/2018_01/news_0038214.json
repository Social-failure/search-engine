Lawyers representing the car owners did not immediately respond to a request for comment. \nA U.S. District Court judge in 2015 gave the final approval of the class settlement, but the companies appealed, saying the agreement was not fair and adequate and that the attorney fees were unreasonable in proportion to the payout the class members would receive. \nThe majority of the appeals court judges on Tuesday agreed with those arguments, finding that the lower court had failed to define a relevant class by also including owners of used cars who were not exposed to misleading advertising. \nBut the circuit judges added that the lower court, on reconsideration, could decide to certify a class again, but must first determine what value is created by a settlement. \nLawyers representing the car owners had been awarded roughly $9 million in attorneys fees and costs.
