(Nasdaq Global Select Market: INDB), parent of Rockland Trust Company, today announced 2017 fourth quarter net income of $22.1 million, or $0.80 per diluted share, compared to $23.9 million, or $0.87 per diluted share, reported in the prior quarter. Net income for the full year was $87.2 million, or $3.19 on a diluted earnings per share basis, as compared to $76.6 million, or $2.90 per diluted share in the prior year. During the fourth quarter of 2017 the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (\"the Tax Act\") was signed into law, requiring the Company to revalue its deferred tax assets and liabilities and reassess the value of its low-income housing project investments (\"LIHTC investments\"). As such, the Company recorded in the fourth quarter additional tax expense of $1.9 million and $466,000 related to the write-down of its net deferred tax assets and LIHTC investments, respectively, both of which were considered to be noncore. There were no adjustments to net income during the third quarter which the Company considers to be noncore. Excluding these items, operating net income for the fourth quarter was $24.4 million, or $0.89 per diluted share, and represented an increase in operating net income of $573,000, or 2.4%, and an increase in operating diluted earnings per share of $0.02, or 2.3%, as compared to the third quarter in 2017. In addition, on an operating basis, full year net income was $91.7 million, or $3.35 on a diluted earnings per share basis, an increase of $11.3 million, or 14.1% in operating net income and an increase in operating diluted earnings per share of $0.31, or 10.2% as compared to the prior year.\n“Rockland Trust set a new earnings per share record in 2017,” said Christopher Oddleifson, the Chief Executive Officer of Independent Bank Corp. and Rockland Trust. “Due to the strong relationships my colleagues establish with our customers, as reflected by J.D. Power’s recognition in 2017 of Rockland Trust as having the highest ranking for customer satisfaction with retail banking in New England, we enjoyed organic loan and deposit growth and delivered a strong return on equity to our shareholders. Rockland Trust augmented its organic growth with the mid-2017 acquisition of The Edgartown National Bank, which expanded our territory to include Martha’s Vineyard. Rockland Trust’s consistently strong performance has us well-positioned for continued growth and expansion in 2018.”\nBALANCE SHEET\nTotal assets of $8.1 billion at December 31, 2017 increased by $29.1 million, or 0.4%, from the prior quarter and by $372.7 million, or 4.8%, as compared to the year ago period, inclusive of the 2017 second quarter Island Bancorp, Inc. (\"Island Bancorp\") acquisition.\nTotal loans rose in the fourth quarter by $65.7 million, or 1.0%, from the prior quarter. The overall growth in the fourth quarter was driven by solid volumes in all commercial loan categories, including strong growth in commercial and industrial (increased by $30.0 million, or 13.9% on an annualized basis) and moderate growth within commercial real estate (increased by $29.4 million or 3.8% on an annualized basis). Exclusive of the Island Bancorp acquisition, total loans increased by $200.4 million, or 3.3%, when compared to the year ago period.\nDeposit balances in the fourth quarter increased by $46.3 million, or 0.7% from the prior quarter. The Company continued to experience strong growth in money market accounts and interest checking accounts along with higher time deposit levels driven by increased customer demand arising from the increase in short term rates. Exclusive of the Island Bancorp acquisition, total deposits increased by $157.4 million, or 2.5%, when compared to the year ago period. The Company's core deposits as a percentage of total deposits remained over 90% at December 31, 2017. The total cost of deposits increased by two basis points in the fourth quarter to 0.22%.\nThe securities portfolio also increased by $37.3 million, or 4.1% compared to the prior quarter due to purchases of $74.9 million, partially offset by paydowns on existing securities, and is up approximately $95.0 million from the year ago period, none of which is attributable to the Island Bancorp acquisition.\nThe Company's total borrowings of $323.7 million decreased $17.0 million during the fourth quarter, mainly due to a decline in customer repurchase agreements. The total cost of borrowings was lowered to 1.58% for the fourth quarter, versus 1.63% in the linked quarter, as the Company realized the full benefit of an interest-rate hedge entered into during the third quarter of 2017.\nStockholders' equity at December 31, 2017 rose to $943.8 million, representing an increase of 1.4% from September 30, 2017, due primarily to strong earnings retention. Stockholders' equity increased by 9.2% when compared to the year ago period, driven primarily by the Island Bancorp acquisition. Book value per share increased $0.44, or 1.3%, during the fourth quarter compared to the prior quarter, and the Company's ratio of common equity to assets of 11.68% increased by 12 basis points from the prior quarter and by 46 basis points from the same period a year ago. The Company's tangible book value per share rose by $0.48, or 1.9%, to $25.60 in the fourth quarter compared to the third quarter of 2017, and is now 9.2% higher than the year ago period. The Company's ratio of tangible common equity to tangible assets of 8.96% at December 31, 2017 represents increases of 14 basis points from the prior quarter and 49 basis points from the same period a year ago.\nNET INTEREST INCOME\nNet interest income for the fourth quarter increased 1.1% to $67.8 million compared to $67.1 million in the prior quarter, mainly attributable to higher levels of interest-earning assets. The Company’s net interest margin remained relatively consistent with the prior quarter at 3.64%, reflecting the slight rise in deposit costs. The benefit of the December Federal Reserve rate increase will not be realized until 2018 due to the timing of asset repricing. The net interest margin for the full year rose by 20 basis points to 3.60%.\nNONINTEREST INCOME\nNoninterest income of $21.9 million increased $1.1 million, or 5.5%, in the fourth quarter compared to the prior quarter. Significant changes in noninterest income in the fourth quarter compared to the prior quarter included the following:\nInvestment management income increased by $259,000, or 4.3%, reflecting a higher level of assets under administration, which grew 6.4% to $3.5 billion as of December 31, 2017, due to strong new business generation as well as market appreciation. The increase in cash surrender value of life insurance policies of $108,000, or 10.6%, was due to the annual dividend income received in the fourth quarter. Loan level derivative income increased by $325,000, or 41.5%, as a result of increased customer demand in the quarter. Other noninterest income increased by $482,000, or 17.7%, primaril", "external_links": ["http://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.rocklandtrust.com&esheet=51744926&newsitemid=20180118006380&lan=en-US&anchor=www.rocklandtrust.com&index=1&md5=8ecc797faf4cb5b5b078d7cffca2db04", "http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180118006380/en/", "http://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.rocklandtrust.com&esheet=51744926&newsitemid=20180118006380&lan=en-US&anchor=www.rocklandtrust.com&index=2&md5=2fe59bbe4f5b7fb9dd9b655c35db0756"], "published": "2018-01-19T00:10:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-19T00:31:14.008+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
