Investors are flocking to the relatively low-cost investments. \nBut when asked about a recent proposal by a competitor to build a “leveraged” ETF that would rise - or fall - twice as fast as the price of bitcoin on a given day, Fink was dismissive. \n“Those are not the kinds of products we would introduce at BlackRock,” Fink told Reuters. \n“Our actions will speak louder than our words.” \nThe comments come as a host of BlackRock’s smaller rivals in the ETF space position themselves for they hope is a gold rush to capitalize after bitcoin’s 1,500 percent surge last year. \nAmong the proposals, Direxion Asset Management LLC is hoping to list a leveraged bitcoin ETF on Intercontinental Exchange Inc’s ( ICE.N ) NYSE Arca exchange that is intended to double the price moves of the digital asset on a given day, according to filings last week. \nThe U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission has been reluctant to let bitcoin funds come to market, with the regulatory agency asking tough questions about the stability of the market for the digital asset and pushing some issuers to withdraw their proposed funds. \nFor his part, Fink has told Reuters that bitcoin is a “speculative” investment that thrives because of its anonymous nature and he puzzled over “why it has so much fascination for the press.” \nIn 2014, Fink shocked some in the ETF business when he said that leveraged ETFs’ structural problems had the potential to “blow up the whole industry one day.” \nLeveraged ETFs are designed to deliver 1.5 or more times a given market index on a day, but they can vary significantly over longer periods. Brokerage firms have been penalized for selling leveraged ETFs to investors for whom they were not suitable. \nBlackRock and Vanguard Group dominate ETF inflows. Last year, BlackRock’s iShares ETFs attracted $245 billion in cash, while Vanguard pulled in $147 billion, according to the companies. \nReporting by Trevor Hunnicutt; Editing by Jennifer Ablan and Jeffrey Benkoe\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-12T21:54:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-12T22:09:39.082+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
