Tight planning rules and a shortage of skilled workers remain a key constraint. \nSteve Wood, NHBC’s chief executive, said he expected housing starts to rise further in 2018. \n“If the economy is sound, the housing market is sound,” he said. “I know there is a bit of an argument about whether we are going to lag behind global growth. But if we are still going to get growth, we will get growth in housing as well.” \nEconomists polled by Reuters on average expect economic growth of 1.4 percent in 2018 - weak by international standards but still better than some of the gloomier forecasts made after Britain voted to leave the European Union in June 2016. \nWood said construction workers - many of whom moved to Britain from eastern Europe - were becoming harder to find, but there was no sign of housing investment drying up ahead of Britain’s scheduled departure from the EU in March 2019. \nHousing starts rose by nearly 20 percent in Wales and parts of central England, and crept up by 1 percent in London - the first rise in the British capital since 2014.
