Trent was credited with a team-high 10 rebounds.\nTJ Gibbs racked up 22 points for Notre Dame (13-9, 3-6), which had its losing streak extend to six games. John Mooney scored 12 of his 14 points in the first half, but the sophomore forward fouled out with 9:05 to play, leaving him one point shy of his career high.\nDuke recovered just two days after a two-point loss to No. 2 Virginia. The Blue Devils haven’t lost consecutive games this season.\nRex Pflueger hit a 3-point basket on the Fighting Irish’s first possession of the second half after going 0-for-3 from long range in the first half.\nDuke scored the next eight points.\nAllen’s steal and dunk followed by a 3-point basket on the next possession boosted Duke to a 68-54 lead with less than 11 minutes to play before an 18-0 run sealed it.\nDuke led 42-34 at halftime despite seven turnovers and six assists.\nNotre Dame avoided a few earlier knockout blows, particularly after Duke built a 19-9 lead less than eight minutes into the game.\nThe Fighting Irish shot 30.6 percent from the field in the first half, but Mooney’s four 3-point baskets proved crucial.\nThe Fighting Irish, who’ve been without standout forward Bonzie Colson for most of the month, played their second game in a row without point guard Matt Farrell. He has been out with a lingering ankle injury, missing five games total with the bone bruise.\nDuke reserve center Marques Bolden played for the first time in nearly a month as he has been out with an injured right knee.\nSince joining the ACC, Notre Dame is 5-4 against Duke, which also won the most recent previous meeting by capturing last March’s ACC Tournament championship game.\n--Field Level Media\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-01-30T10:19:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-30T19:11:41.021+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
