Our performance is underscored by strong organic loan and deposit growth, plus expanding revenue well over the rate of expense growth. Our core EPS 2 grew 22% year over year from $2.54 to $3.10. Net income grew 25% from $259.8 million to $325.5 million.\nFor the past three years, we have posted organic annual growth of $1.5 billion to $3.0 billion in total assets. Total loans grew $1.89 billion to $15.09 billion for the year, up $572 million for the quarter. Total deposits grew $2.42 billion to $16.97 billion for the year, up $68 million for the quarter. Our hands-on approach led to strong metrics for asset quality – nonperforming assets to total assets for the year was 0.36% compared to 0.51% in 2016 and net loan losses for the year were 0.01% of total loans.\nWith the benefits of tax reform ahead, coupled with the energy and drive that our bankers bring to clients in our markets, we are well positioned to continue our strong operating performance.\"\nLINKED-QUARTER BASIS FULL YEAR FINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS:\n▪\nNet income and earnings per share of $89.3 million and $0.85 compared to $82.8 million and $0.79, respectively\n▪\nNet income of $325.5 million and earnings per share of $3.10, compared to $259.8 million and $2.50, respectively\n▪\nNet operating revenue of $223.3 million constituting growth of $11.6 million compared to an increase in operating non-interest expenses of $6.4 million 1\n▪\nNet operating revenue of $827.7 million, constituting year-over-year growth of 18.4%, or $128.6 million, compared to an increase in operating non-interest expenses of 13.3%, or $42.3 million 1\n▪\nOperating pre-provision net revenue of $127.8 million up $5.2 million from $122.7 million 1\n▪\nOperating pre-provision net revenue of $466.6 million up $86.2 million from $380.4 million 1\n▪\nIncome tax expense includes the effect of the Tax Cut and Jobs Act and related actions, which in aggregate resulted in essentially no change in income performance\n▪\nIncome tax expense increased $24.9 million due to an increase in pre-tax income, while the effective tax rate was stable at 28%\nFINANCIAL POSITION RESULTS:\n▪\nTotal loans of $15.09 billion, up $572 million\n▪\nIncrease in total loans of $1.89 billion\n▪\nTotal deposits of $16.97 billion, up $68 million\n▪\nIncrease in total deposits of $2.42 billion\n▪\nStockholders' equity of $2.23 billion, up $84 million\n▪\nIncrease in stockholders' equity of $338 million\nLOANS AND ASSET QUALITY:\n▪\nNonperforming assets (nonaccrual loans and repossessed assets) to total assets of 0.36% compared to 0.42%\n▪\nNonperforming assets to total assets of 0.36%, compared to 0.51%\n▪\nAnnualized net loan charge-offs to average loans outstanding of 0.04%, compared to 0.01%\n▪\nNet loan charge-offs to average loans outstanding of 0.01%, compared to 0.02%\nKEY PERFORMANCE METRICS:\n▪\nNet interest margin of 4.73%, compared to 4.65%\n▪\nNet interest margin of 4.65%, compared to 4.58%\n▪\nReturn on average assets and return on tangible common equity 1 of 1.79% and 18.80%, compared to 1.71% and 18.18%, respectively\n▪\nReturn on average assets and return on tangible common equity 1 of 1.72% and 18.32%, compared to 1.61% and 17.71%, respectively\n▪\nTangible common equity ratio of 9.6%, compared to 9.4% 1\n▪\nTangible common equity ratio of 9.6%, compared to 9.4% 1\n▪\nTangible book value per share, net of tax, of $18.31, an increase from $17.53 1\n▪\nTangible book value per share, net of tax, of $18.31 an increase of 20.7% from $15.17 1\n▪\nOperating efficiency ratio of 40.7%, compared to 40.0% 1\n▪\nOperating efficiency ratio of 41.5%, compared to 43.4% 1\n1 See reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures.\n2 Non-GAAP Financial Measure, excludes acquisition / restructure expense, net of tax.\nIncome Statement\nNet interest income was $211.0 million in the fourth quarter 2017, an increase of $9.4 million from $201.6 million in the third quarter 2017, and an increase of $35.8 million or 20.4%, compared to the fourth quarter 2016. Net interest income in the fourth quarter 2017 includes $7.1 million of total accretion income from acquired loans, compared to $7.5 million in the third quarter 2017, and $7.0 million in the fourth quarter 2016. For 2017, net interest income was $784.7 million an increase of $127.5 million or 19.4%, from $657.2 million in 2016.\nThe Company’s net interest margin in the fourth quarter 2017 was 4.73%, an increase from 4.65% the third quarter 2017, and an increase from 4.57% in the fourth quarter 2016. The increase in net interest margin from the third quarter 2017 primarily relates to an increase in yield on most interest-earning asset categories. The increase in net interest margin from the fourth quarter 2016 primarily relates to the rise in short-term interest rates during the year. For 2017, net interest margin was 4.65%, compared to 4.58% in 2016. The increase in net interest margin from the prior year relates primarily to an increase in loan yield resulting from additional income from the Hotel Franchise Finance acquisition, partially offset by higher costs of deposits and qualifying debt.\nOperating non-interest income was $12.3 million for the fourth quarter 2017, compared to $10.1 million for the third quarter 2017, and $10.4 million for the fourth quarter 2016. 1 Operating non-interest income for the fourth quarter 2017 was elevated as a result of warrant income of $1.4 million and net gains on SBA loan sales of $1.2 million. For 2017, operating non-interest income was $43.0 million an increase of $1.2 million or 2.8%, compared to $41.8 million in 2016. 1\nNet operating revenue was $223.3 million for the fourth quarter 2017, an increase of $11.6 million, compared to $211.7 million for the third quarter 2017, and an increase of $37.6 million or 20.2%, compared to $185.7 million for the fourth quarter 2016. 1 For 2017, net operating revenue was $827.7 million an increase of $128.6 million, or 18.4%, compared to $699.1 million in 2016. 1\nOperating non-interest expense was $95.4 million for the fourth quarter 2017, compared to $89.0 million for the third quarter 2017, and $82.7 million for the fourth quarter 2016. 1 The Company’s operating efficiency ratio 1 on a tax equivalent basis was 40.7% for the fourth quarter 2017, compared to 40.0% for the third quarter 2017, and 42.4% for the fourth quarter 2016. For 2017, operating non-interest expense was $361.0 million, an increase of $42.3 million or 13.3%, compared to $318.7 million in 2016. 1 This increase was primarily driven by an increase in salaries and benefits, including incentive compensation, to accommodate growth and performance.\nIncome tax expense was $35.0 million for the fourth quarter 2017, compared to $34.9 million for the third quarter 2017, and $26.4 million for the fourth quarter 2016. Income tax expense for the fourth quarter 2017 is comparable to the prior quarter due to remeasurement of the Company's deferred tax assets and liabilities as a result of the Tax Cut and Jobs Act and related actions. This adjustment to the deferred tax asset is management's best estimate based upon the information available as of this earnings release and is subject to change as final tax related calculations are completed in conjunction with the filing of our Form 10-K and the one-year remeasurement period granted by the SEC.\nNet income was $89.3 million for the fourth quarter 2017, an increase of $6.5 million from $82.8 million for the third quarter 2017, and an increase of $19.5 million or 28.0%, from $69.8 million for the fourth quarter 2016. Earnings per share was $0.85 for the fourth quarter 2017, compared to $0.79 for the third quarter 2017, and $0.67 for the fourth quarter 2016. For 2017, net income was $325.5 million an increase of $65.7 million or 25.3%, compared to $259.8 million in 2016. Earnings per share for 2017 was $3.10 an increase of 23.9%, compared to $2.50 in 2016.\nThe Company views its operating pre-provision net revenue (\"PPNR\") as a key metric for assessing the Company’s earnings power, which it defines as net operating revenue less operating non-interest expense. For the fourth quarter 2017, the Company’s operating PPNR was $127.8 million, up from $122.7 million in the third quarter 2017, and up 24.1% from $103.1 million in the fourth quarter 2016. 1 The non-operating items 1 for the fourth quarter 2017 consisted primarily of net gains on sales of investment securities of $1.4 million. For 2017, operating PPNR was $466.6 million an increase of $86.2 million or 22.7%, from $380.4 million in 2016. 1\nThe Company had 1,725 full-time equivalent employees and 47 offices at December 31, 2017, compared to 1,673 employees and 47 offices at September 30, 2017, and 1,514 employees and 48 offices at December 31, 2016.\nBalance Sheet\nGross loans totaled $15.09 billion at December 31, 2017, an increase of $572 million from $14.52 billion at September 30, 2017, and an increase of $1.89 billion from $13.21 billion at December 31, 2016. The year-over-year increase is due to organic loan growth. At December 31, 2017, the allowance for credit losses to gross loans held for investment was 0.93%, compared to 0.94% at September 30, 2017, and 0.95% at December 31, 2016. At December 31, 2017, the allowance for credit losses to total organic loans was 1.03%, compared to 1.06% at September 30, 2017, and 1.11% at December 31, 2016. The Company defines its organic loans as those loans that have not been acquired in a transaction accounted for as a business combination.\nConsistent with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (\"GAAP\"), the allowance for credit losses is not carried over in an acquisition because acquired loans are recorded at fair value, which discounts the loans based on expected future cash flows. Credit discounts on acquired loans are included as a reduction to gross loans. These discounts totaled $27.0 million at December 31, 2017, compared to $32.7 million at September 30, 2017, and $47.3 million at December 31, 2016.\nDeposits totaled $16.97 billion at December 31, 2017, an increase of $68 million from $16.90 billion at September 30, 2017, and an increase of $2.42 billion from $14.55 billion at December 31, 2016. The increase from both the prior quarter and from December 31, 2016 is the result of organic deposit growth. Non-interest bearing deposits were $7.43 billion at December 31, 2017, compared to $7.61 billion at September 30, 2017, and $5.63 billion at December 31, 2016. Non-interest bearing deposits comprised 43.8% of total deposits at December 31, 2017, compared to 45.0% at September 30, 2017, and 38.7% at December 31, 2016. The proportion of savings and money market balances to total deposits was 37.3%, compared to 37.3% at September 30, 2017, and 42.1% at December 31, 2016. Certificates of deposit as a percentage of total deposits were 9.6% at December 31, 2017, compared to 9.4% at September 30, 2017, and 10.0% at December 31, 2016. The Company’s ratio of loans to deposits was 88.9% at December 31, 2017, compared to 85.9% at September 30, 2017, and 90.8% at December 31, 2016.\nBorrowings totaled $390 million at December 31, 2017, an increase from zero at September 30, 2017, and an increase of $310 million from $80 million at December 31, 2016. The increase in borrowings from both the prior quarter and the prior year is due to an increase in FHLB overnight advances.\nQualifying debt totaled $377 million at December 31, 2017, compared to $373 million at September 30, 2017, and $368 million at December 31, 2016.\nStockholders’ equity at December 31, 2017 was $2.23 billion, compared to $2.15 billion at September 30, 2017, and $1.89 billion at December 31, 2016.\nAt December 31, 2017, tangible common equity, net of tax, was 9.6% of tangible assets 1 and total capital was 13.2% of risk-weighted assets. The Company’s tangible book value per share 1 was $18.31 at December 31, 2017, up 20.7% from December 31, 2016.\nTotal assets increased 2.0% to $20.33 billion at December 31, 2017, from $19.92 billion at September 30, 2017, and increased 18.2% from $17.20 billion at December 31, 2016. The increase in total assets from the prior year relates primarily to organic loan growth and an increase in investment securities resulting from utilized cash from increased deposits.\nAsset Quality\nThe provision for credit losses was $5.0 million for the fourth quarter 2017, consistent with $5.0 million for the third quarter 2017, and compared to $1.0 million for the fourth quarter 2016. Net loan charge-offs (recoveries) in the fourth quarter 2017 were $1.4 million or 0.04% of average loans (annualized), compared to $0.4 million, or 0.01%, in the third quarter 2017, and $(0.8) million, or (0.03)%, in the fourth quarter 2016.\nNonaccrual loans decreased $11.1 million to $43.9 million during the quarter and increased $3.7 million during the year. Loans past due 90 days and still accruing interest totaled $43 thousand at December 31, 2017, compared to $44 thousand at September 30, 2017, and $1.1 million at December 31, 2016. Loans past due 30-89 days and still accruing interest totaled $10.1 million at quarter end, an increase from $5.2 million at September 30, 2017, and an increase from $6.3 million at December 31, 2016.\nRepossessed assets totaled $28.5 million at December 31, 2017, a decrease of $0.5 million from $29.0 million at September 30, 2017, and a decrease of $19.3 million from $47.8 million at December 31, 2016. Adversely graded loans and non-performing assets totaled $355.2 million at December 31, 2017, a decrease of $51.0 million from $406.2 million at September 30, 2017, and a decrease of $12.3 million from $342.9 million at December 31, 2016.\nAs the Company’s asset quality improved and its capital increased, the ratio of classified assets to Tier I capital plus the allowance for credit losses, a common regulatory measure of asset quality, was 10.3% at December 31, 2017, compared to 10.8% at September 30, 2017, and 11.8% at December 31, 2016. 1\n1 See reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures.\nSegment Highlights\nThe Company's reportable segments are aggregated primarily based on geographic location, services offered, and markets served.

The reclassifications have no effect on net income or stockholders’ equity as previously reported.\nUse of Non-GAAP Financial Information\nThis press release contains both financial measures based on GAAP and non-GAAP based financial measures, which are used where management believes them to be helpful in understanding the Company’s results of operations or financial position. Where non-GAAP financial measures are used, the comparable GAAP financial measure, as well as the reconciliation to the comparable GAAP financial measure, can be found in this press release. These disclosures should not be viewed as a substitute for operating results determined in accordance with GAAP, nor are they necessarily comparable to non-GAAP performance measures that may be presented by other companies.\nEarly Adoption of Accounting Standards\nDuring the fourth quarter 2017, the Company elected to early adopt Accounting Standards Update (\"ASU\") 2017-12, Targeted Improvements to Accounting for Hedging Activities. The amendments in this ASU simplify the application of hedge accounting by changing how companies assess effectiveness of hedging instruments. The guidance also amends the presentation and disclosure requirements for hedging activities. Under the new accounting guidance, a qualitative hedge effectiveness assessment can be performed after the initial quantitative assessment. In addition, the timing of the completion of the initial quantitative hedge effectiveness assessment may be pushed out to the first quarterly reporting date subsequent to entering into the hedge.\nUpon adoption of the new accounting guidance, the Company recorded a cumulative basis adjustment of $0.5 million for its fair value hedges as an adjustment to retained earnings as of January 1, 2017 and, the effects of hedging ineffectiveness previously recognized in each of the quarters of 2017 was reversed, which totaled less than $0.1 million for the year.\nCautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\nThis release contains forward-looking statements that relate to expectations, beliefs, projections, future plans and strategies, anticipated events or trends and similar expressions concerning matters that are not historical facts.

Footnotes (1) We believe these non-GAAP measurements provide a useful indication of the cash generating capacity of the Company. (2) We believe this non-GAAP measurement is a key indicator of the earnings power of the Company. (3) We believe this non-GAAP ratio provides an important metric with which to analyze and evaluate financial condition and capital strength. (4) We believe this non-GAAP measurement improves the comparability to other institutions that have not engaged in acquisitions that resulted in recorded goodwill and other intangibles. (5) We believe this non-GAAP ratio provides a useful metric to measure the operating efficiency of the Company. (6) Under the current guidelines of the Federal Reserve and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, common equity Tier 1 capital consists of common stock, retained earnings, and minority interests in certain subsidiaries, less most other intangible assets. (7) Common equity Tier 1 is often expressed as a percentage of risk-weighted assets. Under the risk-based capital framework, a bank's balance sheet assets and credit equivalent amounts of off-balance sheet items are assigned to one of the risk categories defined under new capital guidelines. The aggregated dollar amount in each category is then multiplied by the risk weighting assigned to that category. The resulting weighted values from each category are added together and this sum is the risk-weighted assets total that, as adjusted, comprises the denominator (risk-weighted assets) of the common equity Tier 1 ratio. Common equity Tier 1 is divided by the risk-weighted assets to determine the common equity Tier 1 ratio. We believe this non-GAAP ratio provides an important metric with which to analyze and evaluate financial condition and capital strength. (8) We believe this non-GAAP ratio provides an important regulatory metric to analyze asset quality. (9) Current quarter is preliminary until Call Report is filed.\nView source version on businesswire.com: http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180125006364/en/\nWestern Alliance Bancorporation\nDale Gibbons, 602-952-5476\nSource: Western Alliance Bancorporation", "external_links": ["https://services.choruscall.com/links/wal180126.html", "http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180125006364/en/", "http://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.westernalliancebancorporation.com&esheet=51748733&newsitemid=20180125006364&lan=en-US&anchor=www.westernalliancebancorporation.com&index=2&md5=1df349f55332261790f8d4d524781852", "http://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=https%3A%2F%2Fservices.choruscall.com%2Flinks%2Fwal180126.html&esheet=51748733&newsitemid=20180125006364&lan=en-US&anchor=https%3A%2F%2Fservices.choruscall.com%2Flinks%2Fwal180126.html&index=1&md5=cc67422ac9219f27a4b1df50d6be575f"], "published": "2018-01-26T01:04:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-26T01:27:33.009+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
