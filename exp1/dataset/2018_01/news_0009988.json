That decision was extended last autumn after a large survey of public opinion, in which 60,000 people took part, found 99 percent opposed fracking.\nHowever expert opinion consulted as part of the government’s report also found that the regulatory framework was “largely in place” to control the potential environmental impacts.\nIneos said that, having attracted investment for fracking, the ban would mean the Scottish government had to compensate the companies concerned.\n“If Scotland wants to continue to be considered as a serious place to do business, then it cannot simply remove the policy support that attracted that investment in the first place without proper procedures being followed and without the offer of appropriate financial compensation,” Pickering said.\nScottish government energy minister Paul Wheelhouse, said:\n“We have taken a careful and considered approach to arriving at our preferred policy on unconventional oil and gas in Scotland.”\nEditing by Stephen Addison\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-09T15:29:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-09T15:42:07.020+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
