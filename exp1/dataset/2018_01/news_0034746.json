The report also said that Deutsche Bank reported its suspicions to German financial watchdog BaFin. \n“It is wrong to assert that Deutsche Bank supplied the German financial supervisory authority BaFin with a report stating that the real estate investor Jared Kushner or companies or persons associated with him may have channeled suspect funds via Deutsche Bank when executing their transactions,” Deutsche Bank said. \n“We are taking legal action regarding this reporting,” the bank said.
