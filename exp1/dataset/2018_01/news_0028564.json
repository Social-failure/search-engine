It was annoying him, so the decision was made, from himself as well, because he’s old and wise enough, to get that tidied up. \n“At his age he knows when it’s right or wrong, so he and the surgeon decided it was best to do it... With good management we felt Jon would be okay, but unfortunately he has missed a lot of time and continues to do so.” \nForward Chris Wood and defender Stephen Ward are also out with knee injuries for the visit of United but midfielder Scott Arfield could return to the team after missing two games with a hamstring problem. \nBurnley, who are seventh in the table with 34 points after nine wins, seven draws and seven defeats, are without a victory in six league games.
