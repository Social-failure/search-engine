[L8N1P54VX]\nThe Cuban foreign ministry did not break down details of the new deal, for the 2019-2021 period, and whether it would include crude.\nHowever official news agency Prensa Latina wrote that “the commitment is one of the most significant between the two countries in recent times”.\nIt came as Cuba agreed to send more doctors to Algeria, Prensa Latina wrote, during the visit of Algerian Health Minister Mokhtar Hasbellaoui.\nThe cash-strapped Caribbean nation exchanges medical and other professional services for oil and oil products. The expansion of services provision to Algeria could suggest the energy deal entails increased shipments.\nThe drop in Venezuelan oil imports has weighed heavily on Cuba’s economy over the last few years, prompting it to ration fuel and electricity.\nReporting by Sarah Marsh; Editing by Alistair Bell\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-01-31T09:35:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-31T04:29:02.004+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
