The Myanmar military launched a crackdown after Rohingya militants attacked security posts in Maungdaw on Aug. 25, leading to the exodus.\nEditing by Raju Gopalakrishnan and Michael Perry\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-31T09:58:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-31T10:18:32.017+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
