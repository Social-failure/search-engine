Elovitch has denied any wrongdoing.\nElliott called for the immediate resignation of all Bezeq directors implicated in the ISA’s investigation and those affiliated with Eurocom.\n“Such directors should be replaced with independent and professional directors elected from a slate of candidates proposed by an independent special committee of the board,” the letter said.\nBezeq shares were up 4.5 percent in midday Tel Aviv trade.\nEurocom Chairman Elovitch is under pressure to sell Eurocom, which is laden with nearly 1 billion shekels ($293 million) in debt.\nOn Monday Eurocom petitioned a Tel Aviv court to allow a debt settlement that would bring it a new controlling shareholder - a group led by U.S.-Israeli businessman Naty Saidoff.\nElliott, in its letter, said that in the event of a change in ownership of Bezeq, the directors nominated by the new controlling shareholder should be chosen according to their relevant experience in businesses at this scale, “and their clean, established record”.\nKey Bezeq shareholders should be consulted on the identity of new directors and their appointment should be confirmed by a shareholder meeting, it said.\nElliott noted that independent shareholders own 73.7 percent of Bezeq.\n“We ... believe there is significant value to be unlocked if the right steps are taken to improve the company’s corporate governance,” the letter said.\nElliott Advisors is an affiliate of New York-based Elliott Management Corp.\n($1 = 3.4078 shekels)\nEditing by Steven Scheer and Susan Fenton\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-16T13:14:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-16T13:28:44.001+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
