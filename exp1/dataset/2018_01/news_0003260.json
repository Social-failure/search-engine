REUTERS/Andrew Kelly The numbers drawn on Tuesday were 1, 42, 64, 47, 70 and the Mega Ball was 22.\nBut lottery players will have another chance to strike it rich on Wednesday when Powerball holds its next drawing for an estimated $440 million prize, with a cash value of $278 million. That amount marks the ninth largest jackpot in the game’s history, according to figures on the Powerball website.\nThe odds of a single ticket hitting all six numbers in the Powerball are 292 million to one, according to the Multi-State Lottery Association.\nNo one has hit the Powerball jackpot since Oct. 25, when a player in Louisiana won $191 million jackpot, the game said.\nFILE PHOTO - Lottery balls wait to be dropped prior to the lottery drawing for the Mega Millions jackpot, estimated at $636 million, in Atlanta, Georgia December 17, 2013.

The odds of hitting the Mega Millions jackpot are 303 million to one, the game said.\nThe cash value figures of both games are the estimated total if a winner selects one lump-sum payment, rather than the other option of taking annual payments.\nBoth estimated totals are before any taxes are assessed.\nThe Mega Millions lottery is offered in 44 U.S. states, the Washington, D.C. and the U.S. Virgin Islands. Powerball tickets are sold in 44 states, and Washington, D.C., Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands.\nThe largest Powerball jackpot was $1.6 billion payout split among winners in California, Florida and Tennessee in January 2016.
