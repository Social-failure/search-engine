Earlier police reports that said Smith had died in the attack were incorrect, he said.\nBroadwater did not dispute, but could not confirm, local media reports about the relationship between Smith and his alleged victims.\n“We understand what the family and friends are saying, they probably know more than we do,” Broadwater said. “I‘m sure it will be confirmed.”\nCline, 25, had recently broken off a romantic relationship with Smith, the shooter, and begun dating William Scott Porterfield, 27, Porterfield’s widow, Jenna Porterfield, told the Post-Gazette.\nPorterfield could not be reached for immediate comment.\nThe other victims included Chelsie Cline’s brother, Seth, and his friend, Courtney Snyder, police said.\nReporting by Jonathan Allen in New York; Editing by Bernadette Baum\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-29T19:53:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-29T20:17:14.012+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
