The super blue moon is seen between British and Chinese flags raised at Tiananmen square in Beijing as British Prime Minister Theresa May visit China's capital, January 31, 2018. REUTERS/Damir Sagolj \nThe entire passage will take more than three hours, during which the moon will turn a coppery red as sunlight going   bounces off its surface. \n(For a graphic - Once in a   click tmsnrt.rs/2EoZDc2 ) Slideshow (2 Images) \nSkywatchers across western North America set their alarms to wake before dawn on Wednesday, with hundreds expected to view the phenomenon from a Los Angeles mountaintop.. \nThe rare eclipse was also visible in Australia, Japan and Southeast Asia. \nThe “lunar trifecta”, as it is described by NASA, last took place in the Western hemisphere on March 31, 1866, when the second dome of the United States Capitol had just been completed and H.G. Wells, author of “The Time Machine”, was born.
