They will host Missouri on Saturday.\nAaron Epps led the Tigers with 13 points and 11 rebounds, Skylar Mays and Randy Onwuasor scored 12 points each, and Duop Reath had 11 as LSU shot 52.7 percent (29 of 55) from the floor.\nJaylen Barford had 17 points as the only double-figure scorer for the Razorbacks, who shot 33.3 percent (19 of 57).\nLSU led by 20 at halftime and scored the first four points of the second half before Arkansas made a push.\nBarford scored 10 points during a 22-10 run that got the Razorbacks within 55-43 midway through the second half.\nEpps made a 3-pointer and Brandon Rachal hit three layups as the Tigers increased the advantage to 66-43 with seven minutes remaining.\nArkansas took its only lead of the game at 1-0 before Epps scored the next five points.\nAfter a Razorbacks basket, Reath scored seven points as the Tigers extended the lead to 19-5. Arkansas went more than four minutes without scoring.\nTrey Thompson’s tip-in ended the drought, but Mays scored seven points during a 16-5 run that gave LSU a 36-14 cushion.\nBarford gave the Razorbacks a slight lift when he made a 3-pointer and two free throws and they got within 41-21 at halftime.\nArkansas shot just 18.2 percent (6 of 33) and made just 1 of 11 3-pointers in its lowest-scoring first half of the season.
