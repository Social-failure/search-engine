Neither firm could be reached for comment.\nFund managers thought the proposals had a chance at winning approval given the launch last month of futures contracts based on bitcoin on both the CME and the CBOE exchanges.\nRegulators have been scrambling to figure out how to deal with this relatively new asset, and no single one has control.\nThe SEC has dominion over funds, while the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) governs futures contracts. The CFTC has been under pressure to address concerns it did not fully assess the potential risks that bitcoin poses to the financial system.\nBitcoin is a virtual asset that can be used to move money around the world quickly and with relative anonymity, without the need for a central authority, such as a bank or government. Trading has been expensive, difficult and fraught with wild price swings.\nThe SEC's decisions also face close scrutiny given its power to clear the way for products that could be among the more volatile traded in U.S. equity markets.\nThe SEC and the CFTC could not immediately be reached for comment.\nOne of the ETFs being proposed would be designed to rise or fall in price twice as fast as the price of bitcoin on a given day. Over the last two years alone, bitcoin has gained or lost more than 10 percent on a single day 26 different times, according to data from the Bitstamp exchange.\nBitcoin's price was little changed at about $15,000 Monday evening on the Bitstamp exchange.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-09T03:40:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-09T10:14:22.148+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
