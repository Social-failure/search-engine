The gap with its U.S peer widened to around 212 bps on the day, its highest since April 2017.\nIn Europe, indicators have pointed towards a strong economic performance in 2018, which in turn puts pressure on the ECB to withdraw extraordinary stimulus - due to run until September at least - sooner rather than later.\nThough inflation is still well below the ECB’s target, some suggest this could soon change soon and investors are keeping an eye on a German wage dispute, with the country’s biggest union demanding an inflation-busting 6 percent pay hike this year.\nA sharp rise in oil prices could also push inflation higher worldwide. U.S. crude prices on Wednesday touched their highest since December 2014.\nMeanwhile, other analysts pointed to a spike in supply as another cause for rising yields.\n“Italy and Portugal announced syndications overnight and many financials are hitting the screens as well, so many international investors are shifting their portfolios to make room for this supply,” DZ Bank analyst Pascal Segesser said.\nItaly generated over 26 billion euros of demand for a 20-year bond sale, while Portugal received over 17 billion euros of orders for a 10-year bond syndication.\nGermany sold just over 4 billion euros of 10-year bonds in an auction, short of its 5 billion euro target.\nThe yield rises are prompting bond investors to ask whether this is the start of a sustained bear market.\n“We have had some strong growth numbers at the start of the year and there’s some questions on whether the central banks will finally change their stance,” DZ Bank’s Segesser said.
