It’s been on the cards for some time,” said Ken Odeluga, market analyst at City Index. \n“With a good ... return so far this month in the bag, it makes a lot of sense to take some money off the table,” Odeluga added. \nOn the day, financials took more than 26 points off the index, while materials and energy together sliced off around 32 points. \nShares in miner Anglo American ( AAL.L ) fell 2.3 percent, while peers Antofagasta ( ANTO.L ), Glencore ( GLEN.L ) and BHP Billiton ( BLT.L ) were down between 1.7 percent to 1.9 percent. \nAmong banks, RBS ( RBS.L ) and Barclays ( BARC.L ) were both down 2.7 percent. \nMore defensive stocks were the biggest risers, with consumer goods group Reckitt Benckiser ( RB.L ) up 1.4 percent as a weaker pound helped big, international stocks gain ground. \nOutside the blue chips, earnings and deal-making were in focus. Shares in UBM ( UBM.L ) rose 4.3 percent after Informa ( INF.L ) sealed its takeover of the conference organiser. Informa’s shares rose 0.8 percent. \nShares in Domino’s Pizza ( DOM.L ) touched their highest level since March 2017 after its fourth quarter sales beat estimates. The pizza delivery firm said its annual pre-tax profit would be slightly ahead of market expectations. \n“(Domino‘s) update today shows good progress in Q4,” analysts at Stifel said in a note. \n“This demonstrates that Domino’s has regained its growth momentum following difficult trading conditions at the beginning of the year,” Stifel analysts added. \nIts shares ended up 1.4 percent, off earlier highs.
