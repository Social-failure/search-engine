A weaker dollar makes dollar-denominated commodities less expensive for holders of other currencies.\nMolten copper flows into rotating molds during the production of copper cathode sheets in the copper smelting shop at the Uralelectromed OJSC Copper Refinery, operated by Ural Mining and Metallurgical Co. in Verkhnyaya Pyshma, Russia.

Analysts said the safe-haven metal was benefiting from continued uncertainty over the U.S.’s long-term budget.\nAmong base metals, zinc was down 0.29% at $3,406.50 a metric ton, aluminum was down 0.51% at $2,237.75 a metric ton, tin was down 0.22% at $20,700 a metric ton, nickel was down 0.08% at $12,735 a metric ton, and lead fell 0.10% to $2,608 a metric ton.\nWrite to Christopher Alessi at christopher.alessi@wsj.com and Ira Iosebashvili at ira.iosebashvili@wsj.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-23T20:24:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-23T22:58:00.008+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
