Al Yamamah Steel climbed 3.1 percent in heavy trade; its board proposed a second-half cash dividend of 0.50 riyal, down from 1.0 riyal in the first half, but also approved the start of two projects to produce equipment for solar and wind energy generation. Investment in the projects is expected to total 260 million riyals ($69.3 million).\nQatar’s index slipped 0.2 percent as Medcare Group , which had doubled since mid-November, pulled back 2.2 percent.
