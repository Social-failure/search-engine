[O/R]\nUnlike in previous years, political events also boosted prices.\nFILE PHOTO: Italian oil major Eni's CEO Claudio Descalzi gestures during a news conference to present an agreement on research in alternative fuels and carbon-cutting technologies in Rome, Italy, November 21, 2017. REUTERS/Remo Casilli These include a collapse in oil supplies in Venezuela, disruptions in Libya and concerns over exports from Iran, OPEC’s third largest producer, should the United States revive sanctions on the country.\n“Prices haven’t been so sensitive to geopolitical events because we had a big inventory cushion,” Desclazi said.\n“Today we no longer have an inventory cushion or a large spare capacity. We have a system which is very price sensitive and runs with no spare capacity.”\n”In this context, any geopolitical event can create a price spike.\nDescalzi said he expected oil demand to expand in 2018 by around 1.3 to 1.5 million barrels per day (bpd).\n“By the end of the year inventories may go down again by 150 to 200 million barrels and fall below the multi-year averages, and it won’t be easy to push U.S. output higher at the same levels in 2019. ” Descalzi said.\nReporting by Dmitry Zhdannikov, writing by Ron Bousso.
