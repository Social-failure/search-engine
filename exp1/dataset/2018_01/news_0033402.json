In other instances, phones did not work at all.\nIn a subsequent statement, Swisscom said an analysis of the issues had determined there were “errors in the supplier software”. It did not name the supplier, which it said had confirmed the error.\nSwisscom said potential financial claims from customers would be governed by their contracts and handled individually.
