Jake Guentzel added a third-period goal for Pittsburgh, which boosted its home-ice winning streak to four games.\nDerek Ryan scored for Carolina, beginning a stretch of three goals in a 2:05 span of the second period. The Penguins posted the other two goals.\nPittsburgh rookie goaltender Casey DeSmith made 34 saves, stopping at least 11 shots in each period.\nHurricanes goaltender Cam Ward was credited with 30 saves. The Penguins managed only seven third-period shots.\nSidney Crosby’s assist on Simon’s goal gave him 1,079 career points, tying him with Jaromir Jagr for second on the Penguins franchise all-time list.\nNine different Pittsburgh players were credited with one point in the game. That included right winger Phil Kessel, who notched his team-leading 34th assist.\nDea was playing in his fourth career game. It was his third game this season.\nCarolina lost for the fourth time in five games.\nThis game was vastly different from Carolina’s 4-0 victory in the same building Jan. 4. The Hurricanes had won both previous meetings this season following Pittsburgh’s seven-game winning streak in the series.\nThese Metropolitan division teams have been jockeying for position away from the top of the standings for several weeks.\nRyan opened the scoring 7:14 into the second period, a much-needed boost for the Hurricanes after their miserable outing two nights earlier in a home loss to Vegas. It was Ryan’s first goal in January.\n--Field Level Media\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-01-24T11:10:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-24T15:54:59.005+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
