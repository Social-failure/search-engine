They agree that there is not sufficient reason to increase prices now,” Garza said.\nInflation in Mexico is near a 16-year high just below 7 percent, and the forecast tortilla price hike, as well as estimates of rising gasoline costs, triggered outrage on social media and threats of protests earlier this week.\nThe price of the tortilla increased about seven percent in the first 11 months of 2017 to around 14.01 pesos ($0.7307) per kilo, according to official figures.\nReporting by Noe Torres and Ana Isabel Martinez; editing by Diane Craft\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-01-06T09:29:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-06T11:39:08.013+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
