Most of the migrants are from West African countries, though some East Africans enter Libya through Sudan.\nArifi said a total of 5,686 migrants had been deported from eastern Libya last year, up from 2,912 in 2016.\nMigrants sit at a detention centre run by the Interior Ministry of Libya's eastern-based government, in Benghazi, Libya January 11, 2018. REUTERS/Esam Omran Al-Fetori One of the Eritrean migrants, speaking at a detention center in Benghazi, said he had arrived in Libya in March last year from Sudan, after paying $4,000 for the journey.\nHe was taken across the Sahara desert to the western Libyan smuggling hub of Sabratha, and waited there with other migrants for about four months before being told the sea route had been closed.\nSlideshow (3 Images) Armed groups began preventing boat departures in Sabratha in July, and a major smuggling group was pushed out of the city in September.\nThe Eritrean said he had then crossed back through the town of Bani Walid to Ajdabiya in the east, close to Zueitina. Smugglers had demanded another $2,000 for the trip to Europe, but he was unable to pay and fled mistreatment at their hands.\n”I wanted to go to Italy to work but unfortunately it wasn’t possible,“ he said. ”We suffer from severe poverty in our country and there’s a dictatorial system.\n“Now because we were treated badly by smugglers we are suffering from illnesses and skin diseases. We don’t want to return to our country, we want to go to Europe.”\nWriting by Aidan Lewis; editing by Andrew Roche\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-01-12T05:45:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-12T04:51:52.006+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
