But even still, a 4 to 5 percent pullback would certainly shake the market,\" Stockton said Tuesday on CNBC's \" Trading Nation .\"\nShe would look to two reliably so-called safe havens in the market if a pullback were to hit stocks.\n\"If you're looking for relative performance during a pullback in the S&P 500, you can typically find it in the more defensive sectors of the market, and those tend to also be the interest rate-sensitive sectors that have underperformed recently with the backup in Treasury yields,\" Stockton said.\nThis would include real estate investment trusts, consumer staples, telecom and utilities. She would look to utilities and the utilities-tracking XLU ETF specifically, because the sector's underperformance has been quite pronounced, to the point of an oversold condition.\nAnother safety play Stockton recommends is the gold miners.\n\"Gold from a long-term perspective has been sort of sleepy, but recently has picked up momentum,\" she said, pointing to a chart of the VanEck Vectors gold miners ETF, the GDX .\n\n\"If we did see a breakout in gold prices with more defensive positioning, it does tend to be looked at as a safe haven at times,\" Stockton said.\nThe XLU was modestly higher Wednesday, while the GDX was barely positive.\nVote Vote to see results Total Votes: Not a Scientific Survey.
