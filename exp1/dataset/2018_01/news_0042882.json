(“East West” or the “Company”) (Nasdaq: EWBC), parent company of East West Bank, the financial bridge between the United States and Greater China, today reported its financial results for the fourth quarter and full year of 2017. For the fourth quarter of 2017, net income was $84.9 million or $0.58 per diluted share. For the full year 2017, net income was $505.6 million or $3.47 per diluted share.\n“Our full year 2017 record earnings increased by 17% year-over-year, reflecting strong revenue growth augmented by contained expenses and credit costs. In 2017, total loans grew $3.5 billion or 14% year-over-year to a record $29.1 billion from $25.5 billion as of December 31, 2016,” stated Dominic Ng, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of East West. “Total deposits grew $2.3 billion or 8% year-over-year to a record $32.2 billion as of December 31, 2017 from $29.9 billion at the end of the previous year.”\n“During the year, East West’s net interest margin expanded by 18 basis points, reflecting our loan growth, attractive deposit mix, and the benefits of higher interest rates on our asset sensitive balance sheet,” continued Ng. “This has been a key component of our profitability; in 2017, we earned a return on average assets of 1.41% and a return on average equity of 13.7%. I would like to thank our 3,000 associates for their dedication and diligence in delivering another year of strong earnings for our shareholders.”\n“At East West, we focus on creating sustainable, expandable and profitable customer relationships. Our consistent financial results year after year reflect the value of this customer focus and our business model as the financial bridge between the East and the West. We are committed to investing in technology and human capital to drive our business forward, continuously strengthening our infrastructure to ensure prudent risk management and operational excellence,” concluded Ng.\nHIGHLIGHTS OF RESULTS\nFull Year and Fourth Quarter Earnings – Full year 2017 net income of $505.6 million grew by 17% year-over-year from $431.7 million; full year 2017 diluted earnings per share (“EPS”) of $3.47 grew by 17% from $2.97 in the previous year. Fourth quarter 2017 net income of $84.9 million and diluted EPS of $0.58 were reduced by $41.7 million 1 , or $0.29 1 per share, due to the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. This reduction in earnings was primarily attributable to the remeasurement of the net deferred tax asset as a result of the reduced corporate tax rate. Fourth quarter 2017 adjusted 1 net income of $126.6 million and adjusted 1 diluted EPS of $0.87 increased by 14% year-over-year, and decreased by 3% linked quarter.

Excluding discount accretion income, fourth quarter 2017 adjusted 2 net interest income of $312.7 million increased by $14.1 million or 5% sequentially, due to loan growth and the expansion of loan yields.

Record Loans – Total loans of $29.1 billion as of December 31, 2017 were up $528.4 million or 2%, from $28.5 billion as of September 30, 2017. Total loans grew by $3.5 billion or 14% year-over-year.

Noninterest-bearing demand deposits of $10.9 billion made up 34% of deposits as of December 31, 2017. Pending Sale of Desert Community Bank Branches – In November 2017, East West Bank announced the sale of its eight Desert Community Bank (“DCB”) branches and related assets and liabilities. As of December 31, 2017, branch assets held-for-sale (“HFS”) were $91.3 million, of which loans HFS were $78.1 million and deposits HFS were $605.1 million.

Asset Qualit y Metrics – The allowance for loan losses was $287.1 million, or 0.99% of loans held-for-investment (“HFI”), as of December 31, 2017, compared to $285.9 million, or 1.00% of loans HFI, as of September 30, 2017.

(2) Annualized. MANAGEMENT OUTLOOK FOR 2018\nOur current outlook for the expected full year 2018 results, compared to our full year 2017 results, is as follows:\nEnd of Period Loans: increase at a percentage rate of approximately 10%. Net Interest Margin (excluding the impact of ASC 310-30 discount accretion) : between 3.65% and 3.75%. Noninterest Expense (excluding tax credit amortization & deposit premium amortization) : increase at a percentage rate in the high single digits. Provision for Credit Losses: in the range of $70 million to $80 million. Tax Items: projecting investment in tax-advantaged credits of $105 million, excluding low income housing tax credits, and associated tax credit amortization expense of $85 million. Projecting full year effective tax rate of approximately 16%. Interest Rates: our outlook incorporates the current forward rate curve; as such, it currently assumes three fed funds rate increases in the year 2018: in March, June and September.\nOPERATING RESULTS SUMMARY\nFourth Quarter 2017 Compared to Third Quarter 2017\nNet Interest Income\nNet interest income totaled $319.7 million, a 5% increase from $303.2 million.\nAdjusted net interest income, excluding ASC 310-30 discount accretion income, grew to $312.7 million, a 5% increase from $298.6 million. Average loans of $28.6 billion grew by $1.1 billion or 16% annualized from $27.5 billion. Average deposits of $32.3 billion grew by $1.2 billion or 15% annualized from $31.1 billion. Average noninterest-bearing demand deposits of $11.5 billion grew by $875.3 million or 33% annualized from $10.7 billion.\nNet Interest Margin\nNet interest margin expanded by five basis points to 3.57% from 3.52%.\nExcluding the impact of ASC 310-30 discount accretion income, adjusted NIM expanded by three basis points to 3.49% from 3.46%. The yield on loans expanded by 10 basis points to 4.52% from 4.42%; the adjusted 4 loan yield expanded by seven basis points to 4.42% from 4.35%. The cost of deposits increased by three basis points to 0.43% from 0.40%.\nNoninterest Income\nTotal noninterest income of $45.4 million was down by $4.3 million sequentially. Excluding the impact of all gains on sales, total fees and other operating income of $38.5 million was down by $2.3 million, or 6%, from $40.9 million for the third quarter of 2017. This decline was primarily from decreases in derivative fees and other income, as well as in wealth management fees, due to lower customer transaction volumes.\nThe following table presents total fees and other operating income for the three months ended December 31, 2017, September 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016.\nQuarter Ended ($ in thousands) December 31, 2017 September 30, 2017 December 31, 2016 Branch fees $ 10,691 $ 10,803 $ 10,195 Letters of credit fees and foreign exchange income 9,570 10,154 14,356 Ancillary loan fees and other income 6,457 5,987 5,355 Wealth management fees 2,950 3,615 3,378 Derivative fees and other income 4,737 6,663 7,003 Other fees and operating income 4,144 3,652 7,237 Total fees and other operating income $ 38,549 $ 40,874 $ 47,524 Noninterest Expense\nNoninterest expense of $175.4 million includes $151.9 million of adjusted 5 noninterest expense, $21.9 million amortization of tax credit and other investments, and $1.6 million amortization of core deposit intangibles.\nAdjusted noninterest expense of $151.9 million increased by $13.0 million, or 9% linked quarter. This growth was driven by a $10.8 million increase in compensation and employee benefits, largely reflecting increased hiring along with increases in bonus accrual and restricted stock compensation. The adjusted 5 efficiency ratio was 41.6% in the fourth quarter, compared to 39.8% in the third quarter, due to the growth in expenses.\nTAX RELATED ITEMS\nThe Company’s full year 2017 effective tax rate was 31%, resulting in tax expense of $229.5 million, compared to an effective tax rate of 25% and tax expense of $140.5 million for the full year 2016. The effective tax rates for the full year and the fourth quarter of 2017 were elevated because of nonrecurring items related to the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which lowered the federal corporate tax rate to 21% from 35%.\nThese nonrecurring items included a $33.1 million remeasurement of the net deferred tax asset and a $7.9 million remeasurement of investments in qualified affordable housing partnerships, recorded in the fourth quarter of 2017. These adjustments are management’s best estimate based on the information available as of this earnings release and are subject to change as final tax calculations are completed in conjunction with the filing of the Form 10-K. Tax expense in the fourth quarter of 2017 was $89.2 million, compared to $42.6 million in the third quarter of 2017. The total impact of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act was an increase in tax expense of $41.7 million, or $0.29 per share, in the fourth quarter of 2017. Excluding this impact, the adjusted 6 tax expense for the fourth quarter of 2017 was $47.5 million and the adjusted 6 effective tax rate was 27%. Adjusted 6 tax expense for the full year 2017 was $187.8 million and the adjusted 6 effective tax rate was 26%. For the full year 2018, the Company is projecting an effective tax rate of approximately 16%.\nCREDIT QUALITY\nThe allowance for loan losses totaled $287.1 million, or 0.99% of loans HFI, as of December 31, 2017, compared to $285.9 million, or 1.00% of loans HFI, as of September 30, 2017, and $260.5 million, or 1.02% of loans HFI, as of December 31, 2016.\nThe provision for credit losses recorded for the current quarter was $15.5 million, compared to $13.0 million for the third quarter of 2017, and $10.5 million for the fourth quarter of 2016. For the fourth quarter of 2017, net charge-offs were $15.7 million or 0.22% of average loans HFI, annualized. This compares to net charge-offs of $3.8 million or 0.06% of average loans HFI, annualized, for the third quarter of 2017, and net charge-offs of $8.0 million or 0.13% of average loans HFI, annualized, for the fourth quarter of 2016. For the full year 2017, net charge-offs of $22.5 million were 0.08% of average loans HFI, compared to $36.2 million, or 0.15% of average loans HFI, for the full year 2016. Non-PCI nonperforming assets of $115.1 million as of December 31, 2017, decreased by $1.9 million, or 2% linked quarter, from $117.0 million as of September 30, 2017, and decreased by $14.4 million, or 11% year-over-year, from $129.6 million as of December 31, 2016. Non-PCI nonperforming assets were equivalent to 0.31% of total assets at the end of 2017, compared to 0.32% at the end of the previous quarter and 0.37% at the end of 2016.\n4 See reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP financial measures in Table 15.\n5 See reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP financial measures in Table 14.\n6 See reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP financial measures in Table 12.\nCAPITAL STRENGTH\nCapital levels for East West continue to be strong.

In the third quarter of 2017, the Company sold its insurance brokerage business, East West Insurance Services, Inc. (“EWIS”).
