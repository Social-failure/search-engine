Over $30 million of the settlement funds will go toward affected borrowers.\nThe settlement comes as PHH Mortgage awaited a ruling from a U.S. appeals court in its fight against the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. The CFPB sued PHH Mortgage in 2014, charging it engaged in a mortgage insurance kickback scheme.\nThe company responded by challenging the CFPB’s structure in court, arguing it was unconstitutional and the president should have the authority to fire its chief.\nUnder current law, the CFPB director can only be removed for cause. A panel on the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Washington D.C. ruled in 2016 the agency’s structure was unconstitutional. The regulator appealed that ruling, which is pending before the full court.\nIn August, PHH Mortgage agreed to pay $74.5 million to settle a separate U.S. probe over whether it generated defective loans that the federal government then insured and Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac bought.
