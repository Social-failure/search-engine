That compares to a previous expectation of an 80 million pound hit to sales and a 70 million pound benefit on profit. \n“In all, then, this equates to a 7 percent reduction in actual currency EBIT guidance,” RBC said. \nThe company also lowered its expected 2018 tax rate to 20 percent, from 21 percent, due to changes in the U.S. corporate tax legislation. \nDiageo’s shares were up 1 percent at 0950 GMT.
