It reports full results on March 1 along with forecasts for 2018.\nAfter sales in October were dampened by unseasonably warm weather, Ritter said Zalando had a strong end to the year, helped by marketing and pricing, especially around the Black Friday sales and for the Christmas season.\nBritish rival ASOS, which reports on Jan. 25, in October raised its sales growth forecast for the financial year from Sept. 1 to 25-30 percent, and said it expected a stable operating profit margin of 4 percent.
