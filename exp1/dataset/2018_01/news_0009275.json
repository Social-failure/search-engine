It would be wonderful to see him get to the quarters or semi-finals. He has a huge following and is slowly getting it together. It’s great. I am a huge fan of Nick.”\nKyrgios’s antics and unruly behavior have rightly attracted scorn.\nHe was accused of ‘tanking’ a match against Richard Gasquet at Wimbledon in 2015 and was booed by his own fans last year when he suffered a meltdown to lose to Andreas Seppi in five sets in the second round at Melbourne.\nHe has also said that some days he does not even like playing tennis, although Becker says that could be a smokescreen for dealing with the inevitable spotlight that came his way after he stunned Rafael Nadal at Wimbledon in 2014.\n”He has a very interesting personality and doesn’t make it easy for himself at times,“ the German said. ”But he must love tennis otherwise he couldn’t do the things he’s doing.\n”He’s not as clean cut as some Australians would like to see. But he could be an international superstar in sport, with his multi-ethnic background, his style, the ear rings.\n“He is very much the guy all 22-year-olds want to be. I just hope he concentrates a little more on his tennis because it would be wonderful for the sport.”\nKyrgios plays Brazil’s Rogerio Dutra Silva in the first round but faces a tough path to make a deep run.\nFrench former runner-up Jo-Wilfried Tsonga could be waiting in round three with world number three Grigor Dimitrov, who he beat on the way to the Brisbane title, a possible opponent in the last 16.\nThree-times Australian Open winner Mats Wilander believes Kyrgios has shown a huge improvement in his attitude but has concerns over his durability after a spate of hip niggles.\n“I think he seems to be mentally in the right place and he showed that in Brisbane,” the Swede told Reuters. “Is he ready physically to play seven matches in two weeks? I‘m not 100 percent sure.”\nReporting by Martyn Herman; ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-14T08:56:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-14T10:03:48.004+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
