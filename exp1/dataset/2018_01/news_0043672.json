We’re part of it, and we’re part of a world economy. And the president believes that.” \nFor more on Trump at Davos, watch Fortune’s video: \nIn the run-up to his trip to Davos, Trump slapped a 30% tariff on imported solar panels, among the first unilateral trade restrictions imposed by the administration as part of a broader protectionist agenda. \nThen on Wednesday in Davos, U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said he welcomed a weakening in the dollar. Fears of protectionist trade policies by the United States had already pushed the greenback to a three-year low, and Mnuchin’s remark pushed it down further. \nTrump will use his trip for some diplomacy. He has meetings with British Prime Minister Theresa May and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Thursday and Rwandan President Paul Kagame, current chairman of the African Union, and Swiss President Alain Berset on Friday. \nIran’s growing influence in the Middle East, North Korea’s nuclear challenge and the battle against Islamic State militants figured to be prominent topics of his meetings. \nFrench President Emmanuel Macron told RTS channel that he had “strongly recommended” to Trump to attend the Davos forum during a recent phone conversation they had on Iran …“because I think it’s a good thing for President Trump to explain his strategy for the U.S. and the world here in Davos. \n“And that he encounters some form of confrontation and dialog,” Macron said. \nTrump will host a small dinner for European business executives on Thursday night. \nThere is broad concern in European capitals that 2018 could be the year Trump’s bark on trade turns into bite, as he considers punitive measures on steel and threatens to end the 90s-era North American Free Trade Agreement with Canada and Mexico. \nTrump will appeal for increased global investment in the United States to take advantage of corporate tax cuts approved by Congress late in 2017 and Trump’s deregulatory policies.
