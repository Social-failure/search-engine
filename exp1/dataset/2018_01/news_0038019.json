Our aim is to promote good tax governance globally,” said Vladislav Goranov, finance minister of Bulgaria, which holds the rotating EU presidency. \nBut the move drew strong criticism. The delisting of Panama, which was at the centre of one of the largest disclosures, the so-called Panama papers, caused particular concern. \n“Today’s decision is a confession of failure. Crossing Panama, one of the world’s most prolific tax havens off the blacklist, is a disastrous sign in the fight against tax avoidance,” said Markus Ferber, an EU centre-right lawmaker and vice-chair of the European Parliament’s economic committee. \nHe said ministers should have instead expanded the list, including EU countries and jurisdictions, such as Malta and Britain’s overseas territories. \nThe detailed commitments made by the eight jurisdictions who were removed from the list have not been made public, despite calls to do so by EU tax commissioner Pierre Moscovici. \n“The EU is rushing to take countries off the blacklist without it being clear what they have actually committed to improve; this is further undermining the process,” said Aurore Chardonnet, of the anti-poverty group Oxfam. \nShe urged the EU to make public the commitments, echoing calls from lawmakers from several political groupings in the European Parliament. \nGoranov said in a news conference after the meeting that commitments could not be disclosed without the green light of the countries who made them. \nEU officials could ask their counterparts in Panama or Tunisia whether they would agree to publish this information, Goranov said. Countries are usually very reluctant to disclose tax information. \nNine jurisdictions remain on the blacklist. They are American Samoa, Bahrain, Guam, the Marshall Islands, Namibia, Palau, Saint Lucia, Samoa, and Trinidad and Tobago. \nEU ministers avoided discussing possible sanctions for jurisdictions who remain on the blacklist. \nThe eight delisted jurisdictions have been moved to a so-called grey list, which includes other 47 jurisdictions that have committed to changing their tax rules to abide by EU standards on transparency and cooperation. \nCountries on the grey list can be moved back to the blacklist if they fail to respect their engagements.
