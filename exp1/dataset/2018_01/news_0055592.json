This refers to people buying items on credit from catalogues and making regular repayments over time. \nIn 2015, a cap was introduced on interest rates charged by short-term “payday” loans, which is set to be reviewed in 2020. \nThe cap was introduced after criticism from MPs and the Church of England about the very high interest charged by so-called payday loan companies for often vulnerable customers. \n($1 = 0.7075 pounds)", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-31T12:45:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-31T13:15:36.009+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
