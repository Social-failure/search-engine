The new rate was 2.95 percent, the PBOC said.\nOn Tuesday, the central bank injected 320 billion yuan ($49.69 billion) into money markets through 7-day, 14-day and 63-day reverse repos.\nThe PBOC nudged money market interest rates upward in December just hours after the Federal Reserve raised the U.S. benchmark.\nThe Chinese central bank has kept a tight leash on liquidity and rates via open market operations. Analysts say it has had a slight tightening bias as it has sought to discourage short-term borrowing as part of the government’s deleveraging campaign and keep China competitive during a U.S. rate tightening cycle.\n($1 = 6.4404 Chinese yuan)\nReporting by Winni Zhou and John Ruwitch; Editing by Sam Holmes\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-01-16T11:34:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-16T10:13:19.026+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
