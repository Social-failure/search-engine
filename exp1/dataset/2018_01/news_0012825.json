There is no rush.” \n“It’s an amazing company. There is a lot to do,” he added, before a show of its men’s collection for autumn-winter 2018, without giving further details. \nVersace posted sales of just under 670 million euros ($817.00 million) in 2016. \nAkeroyd, formerly head of British brand Alexander McQueen, took over as CEO of Versace in May 2016 from his Italian predecessor Gian Giacomo Ferraris. \nSince his appointment the group has been working on streamlining its management structure.
