REUTERS/Kenny Katombe \nPressed on a date for the elections, Kabila said it was up to the electoral commission to set it. \nKabila’s opponents suspect him of seeking a referendum to change Congo’s constitution to enable him to run for more than two terms, as the leaders of neighboring Uganda, Rwanda and Congo Republic have. He has neither confirmed nor denied this. \n“I have not seen anywhere in CENI’s (the national electoral commission‘s) calendar where the organization of the referendum is planned,” Kabila said, when asked about it. He also said elections would cost $1.2 billion, which he complained was “exorbitant”. \nKabila’s refusal to step down has emboldened armed rebel groups, raising the prospect of the vast, mineral-rich nation sliding back into the wars that killed millions of people in the 1990s, mostly from hunger and disease. \nIt has also raised tensions with the United Nations peacekeeping mission (MONUSCO), which has often stepped in to defend Kabila’s government against rebels but now sometimes finds itself having to shield civilians against Congolese forces. \n“We have to clarify our relations with MONUSCO in the coming days,” Kabila said. “I hope they ... don’t consider Congo as a country under the tutelage of the United Nations.” \nHe did not elaborate.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-26T18:18:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-26T18:39:21.004+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
