More than 1 million more reported to work without knowing when they would be paid, according to media reports.\nThe shutdown occurred after conservative Republicans in the House of Representatives attempted to use the budget process to delay or defund implementation of Democratic President Barack Obama’s Affordable Care Act, known as Obamacare.\nThe impasse between the House and the Democratic-controlled Senate, along with Obama, ended after both chambers passed a Senate-brokered bill with stricter income verification requirements on people obtaining health insurance through Obamacare. The deal to end the shutdown coincided with a deadline to raise the U.S. debt ceiling, the country’s borrowing limit.\nCompiled by Amanda Becker; Additional reporting by Blake Brittain; Editing by Will Dunham and Bill Trott\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-01-20T04:36:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-20T03:07:33.006+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
