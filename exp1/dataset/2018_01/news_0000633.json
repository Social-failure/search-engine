I‘m trying to work hard and stay focused on each match, to show my best tennis and challenge myself to go even higher and better,” she said.\nFormer champion Kaia Kanepi, a winner in 2012, dominated her match against Lesia Tsurenko to seal a 6-4, 6-3 victory and a meeting against second seed Karolina Pliskova who dumped out American CiCi Bellis 6-1 6-1.\nMeanwhile, Aliaksandra Sasnovich sealed a comeback win over Kanepi’s Estonian compatriot Anett Kontaveit. The qualifier from Belarus, who swept aside Kristina Mladenovic in the first round, prevailed 1-6 7-6(2) 6-3 and faces Alize Cornet next.\nReporting by Shrivathsa Sridhar in Bengaluru, Editing by William Maclean\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-03T14:49:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-03T15:08:14.055+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
