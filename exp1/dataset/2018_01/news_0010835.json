It will start broadcasting on Jan. 17. A giant poster advertising of the \"The Assassination of Gianni Versace: American Crime Story\" tv series is seen in downtown Milan, Italy January 10, 2018. REUTERS/Stefano Rellandini \nIn a statement sent by the company, the Versace family said “in the attempt to create a sensational story, (the TV drama) presents gossip full of contradictions”. \n“It saddens (us) to see that among all possible portraits of (Gianni‘s) life and story, the producers chose to present the false and distorted version created by Maureen Orth,” it added. Slideshow (3 Images) \nThe statement said Orth’s book was full of speculation, adding the author had never sought information directly from the family and did not have the knowledge to tell the story, including suppositions on Gianni’s medical conditions. \nDonatella also said in the interview that among the mistakes in the book was the assertion that Gianni had been weak at the time of his murder because he had AIDS. \nThe family distanced itself from the series on Monday, saying it had not authorized it and was not involved. On Tuesday the producer defended the show, saying the family has been treated with respect in it.
