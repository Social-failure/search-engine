I thought he played an incredible match against Novak,” the 36-year-old said. \n”I mean, to beat him here is one of the tough things to do in our sport, I believe. I know that Novak maybe wasn’t at 110 percent, but he was all right. He was giving it a fight till the very end. To close it out, that was mighty impressive. \n”I think it’s an interesting match for me. I’ll definitely have to look into how I need to play against him because he has some great qualities, especially defensively, like Novak has. \n“One thing I know is I‘m going to be playing aggressive. I don’t know how I‘m going to do that exactly yet.” \nAlthough Chung won the Next Gen Finals last year, his meteoric rise to the top table of the tennis world is indicated by the fact that he will be bidding to become the first man in a decade to play his first tour final at a grand slam. \nHis run through the tournament has stunned even him. \n“I‘m really surprised,” he said. “I make semis, I beat like Sascha (fourth seed Alexander Zverev), Novak, the other good players. I never playing in second week in grand slam, so I‘m really surprised.” Reporting by Nick Mulvenney in Sydney; Editing by John O'Brien", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-25T11:08:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-25T11:30:23.016+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
