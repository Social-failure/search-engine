In Turkey, stocks gained 0.7 percent after fresh data showed industrial output rose 7 percent year-on-year in November.\nMeanwhile currencies had a more downbeat start to the week .\nSouth Africa’s rand weakened nearly 1 percent, while Turkey’s lira softened 0.5 percent. However, the falls follow a stellar start to the year and point to a consolidation, said Per Hammarlund, chief emerging markets strategist at SEB.\n“The strong dollar is dominating but it’s not enough to really shake the market,” said Hammarlund, adding the benign macro backdrop for emerging markets was still intact.\nAnd latest data from China, showing that FX reserves jumped by a forecast-beating $20 billion to hit $3.14 trillion – their highest since September 2016 - confirmed the bull run could continue, he added.\n“There is no sign of capital flight from China, so things are going well. That supports risk appetite for emerging markets in general – China is the bellwether to watch,” said Hammarlund.\nA blizzard of data out of China this week is expected to show the world’s second largest economy ended a strong 2017 on a slightly softer note.\nMuch of the focus will be on Friday’s trade figures for December with exports expected to have jumped more than 9 percent after soaring unexpectedly 12.3 percent in November thanks to sustained strength in global demand.\nIn emerging Europe, Romania’s central bank is meeting. A slim majority of analysts is expecting interest rates to stay at a record low of 1.75 percent, while others predict the bank may become the second in Central Europe to start to raise, after the Czech central bank’s two hikes since August.\nThe leu traded close to the two-month high against the euro of the previous session.\nFor GRAPHIC on emerging market FX performance 2017, see tmsnrt.rs/2e7eoml For GRAPHIC on MSCI emerging index performance 2017, see tmsnrt.rs/2dZbdP5\nFor CENTRAL EUROPE market report, see\nFor TURKISH market report, see\nFor RUSSIAN market report, see) Emerging Markets Prices from Reuters Equities Latest Net Chg % Chg % Chg\non year\nMorgan Stanley Emrg Mkt Indx 1205.45 +4.44 +0.37 +4.06\nCzech Rep 1109.70 +4.38 +0.40 +2.93\nPoland 2533.39 +3.84 +0.15 +2.93\nHungary 40013.76 +18.60 +0.05 +1.62\nRomania 7977.06 -8.76 -0.11 +2.88\nGreece 825.79 -3.93 -0.47 +2.92\nRussia 0.00 +0.00 +0.00 -100.00\nSouth Africa 52891.63 +48.95 +0.09 +0.68\nTurkey 17391.12 +753.19 +0.65 +1.78\nChina 3410.00 +18.25 +0.54 +3.11\nIndia 34363.11 +209.26 +0.61 +0.90\nCurrencies Latest Prev Local Local\nclose currency currency\n% change % change\nin 2018\nCzech Rep 25.54 25.52 -0.05 -0.04\nPoland 4.16 4.15 -0.26 +0.30\nHungary 308.94 308.34 -0.19 +0.51\nRomania 4.63 4.63 -0.15 +0.95\nSerbia 118.34 118.64 +0.25 +0.05\nRussia 57.07 56.94 -0.22 +1.04\nKazakhstan 330.17 329.80 -0.11 +0.80\nUkraine 28.19 28.19 +0.00 -0.16\nSouth Africa 12.38 12.29 -0.73 -0.18\nKenya 103.15 103.20 +0.05 -0.05\nIsrael 3.44 3.43 -0.28 +1.09\nTurkey 3.75 3.73 -0.34 +1.13\nChina 6.50 6.49 -0.17 +0.12\nIndia 63.41 63.33 -0.13 +0.66\nBrazil 3.23 3.23 +0.00 +2.58\nMexico 19.19 19.17 -0.10 +2.38\nDebt Index Strip Spd Chg %Rtn Index\nSov‘gn Debt EMBIG 299 1 .01 8 10.75 1\nAll data taken from Reuters at 09:52 GMT.
