Instead, the port reopened at 1.30pm local time.\nThe storm had been expected to hit the beaches of Pilbara iron ore belt, prompting the closure on Thursday of the world’s biggest iron ore export terminal, 1,700 km (1,050 miles) north of Perth, as a safety precaution.\nThe port accounts for over half of Australia’s iron ore exports, handling more than a million tonnes a day from the Pilbara iron belt, the majority bound for Chinese steel mills.\nPort Hedland was cleared of ships and closed on Thursday evening.\nThe storm is the second to menace Australia’s northwest in as many weeks. Cyclone Hilda blew down trees and caused minor damage at Broome last week.\nOn average, there are 10 to 13 tropical cyclones between November and April in the Australian region, four of which typically cross the coast, data from the bureau shows.\nThe possibility of a protracted closure at Port Hedland if Cyclone Joyce had intensified failed to stoke iron ore buying, despite China’s strong reliance on supplies from Australia.\nIron ore futures on the Dalian Commodity Exchange were down 2 percent in trading at the Shanghai Futures Exchange, after falling 0.4 percent in the previous session.\nIron ore for spot delivery to China’s Qingdao port rose 77 cents, or about 1 percent, to $79.08 a ton on Thursday.\nReporting by Tom Westbrook; Additional reporting by Alison Bevege & James Regan & Alana Schetzer; editing by Diane Craft\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-01-14T06:53:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-14T05:30:05.024+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
