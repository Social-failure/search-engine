The meeting took place on Dec. 22 but was not disclosed until now.\n“Spying on people and institutions with special ties to the state of Israel on German soil is an egregious violation of German law,” a ministry official said.\nThe official said Philipp Ackermann, acting director of the Foreign Ministry’s political section, had told the Iranian ambassador that “such activities would not be tolerated and were completely unacceptable”.\nNews of the meeting comes days before the foreign ministers of Iran, Germany, France and Britain are due to meet in Brussels to discuss a 2015 landmark nuclear agreement with Iran, and growing concerns about Iran’s crackdown on anti-government protesters.\nGermany, which helped negotiate the nuclear deal, has sought to balance its interest in expanding trade ties with Iran with its strong commitment to human rights.\nIt has played a key role in European efforts to persuade Washington to keep the nuclear accord in place, an issue that will come up again late this week, when U.S. President Donald Trump must decide whether to reimpose oil sanctions lifted under the agreement.\nGermany’s domestic intelligence service, which handles counterespionage, highlighted Iran’s spying activities in its annual report in July, noting that Tehran was focused heavily on Israeli or pro-Jewish targets.\nReporting by Andrea Shalal; Editing by Alison Williams\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-09T16:18:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-09T16:43:40.022+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
