Proven reserves of coalbed methane have reached 578.4 billion cubic meters (cu m), 88 percent of the country’s total, said Zhou Jianchun, head of the Shanxi land and resources bureau.\nShanxi is targeting proven reserves of more than a trillion cu m by 2020, and will aim to raise annual output to 20 billion cu m, it said. It extracted 10.1 billion cu m of coalbed methane in 2015.\nReporting by David Stanway; editing by Richard Pullin\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-01-19T08:44:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-19T12:21:02.004+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
