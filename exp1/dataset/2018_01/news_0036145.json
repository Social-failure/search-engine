We know each other. We played a couple of times already.”\nTennis - Australian Open - Margaret Court Arena, Melbourne, Australia, January 21, 2018.

REUTERS/Toru Hanai Nadal will take heart from his 5-1 head-to-head record against the Croatian 29-year-old, who won their first meeting in 2009 but has since struggled against the powerful left-hander.\nCilic, however, would like to believe he is better equipped to take on top players like Nadal following his 2014 U.S. Open triumph and run to last year’s Wimbledon final.\n”Throughout my career, I knew that if I‘m playing well, if I‘m top of my game, that I can challenge most of the guys on the tour,“ he said. ”With the win at the U.S. Open that, you know, I believe it just became stronger.\n“I believe in my own game, I believe in what I‘m doing. I think I‘m moving the right direction. You know, it’s obviously a big challenge playing them, but that’s what we also work for on the training.”\nThird seed Grigor Dimitrov, survivor of a fourth-round thriller against home favorite Nick Kyrgios, will also be in action against the sole surviving Briton, Kyle Edmund.\nWomen’s fourth seed Elina Svitolina of Ukraine will seek to maintain her season-opening winning streak against Elise Mertens in the Belgian’s first grand slam quarter-final appearance.\nReporting by Amlan Chakraborty in New Delhi; Editing by John O'Brien\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-01-22T22:10:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-23T18:15:41.004+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
