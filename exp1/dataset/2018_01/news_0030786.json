It uses 3D projection technology to help give the illusion that car chases are taking place over distances much greater than the inside of an arena. \n“Fast and The Furious,” about a gang of illegal street racers, has spawned eight films since 2001, with two more in development, a forthcoming spin-off film, video games and theme park rides. \nThe franchise survived the death of one of its main stars, Paul Walker, killed in a car crash in 2013. \n“I think he would totally get a kick out of, out of seeing our little movie turn into this show at the O2 arena,” Diesel said. “He’d get a kick out of that.” Reporting by Jayson Mansaray; Writing by Mark Hanrahan; Editing by Robin Pomeroy", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-20T16:59:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-20T20:21:42.003+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
