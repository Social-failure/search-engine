A leaked National Security Council memo published by Axios news website on Sunday said China is the dominant manufacturer of network infrastructure and notes the importance of building the network with \"equipment from a trusted supply chain.\"\nThe primary suppliers for the 5G networks in the United States are expected to be firms such as Nokia and Ericsson, with networking firms such as Juniper Networks, Cisco Systems and Qualcomm Inc supplying chips and back end equipment. It was unclear whether the option discussed would involve working with those companies.\nThe rules for 5G networks are still being worked out by industry players. The work has been complicated by an effective ban in the United States on two of the largest firms, Chinese suppliers Huawei Technologies Co Ltd and ZTE Corp since a 2012 investigation over links to potential Chinese spying, something the companies have denied.\nEarlier this year, U.S. lawmakers urged AT&T to cut commercial ties with Huawei.\nU.S. Senator Mark Warner, a Democrat and vice chair of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, said that while he agreed there were \"serious concerns relating to the Chinese governments influence into network equipment markets\" he thought the proposal for the federal government to build a standalone network would be \"expensive and duplicative.\"\nAny 5G nationalization plan would likely cost hundreds of billions of dollars, wireless carriers said.\nRepresentative Greg Walden, a Republican who chairs the Energy and Commerce Committee, dismissed the idea.\n\"We're not Venezuela. We don't need to have the government run everything,\" Walden said. He noted that government data has been hacked, but said it was important 5G networks are \"safe and secure.\"\nShares of the biggest U.S. wireless carriers fell at the start of trade on Monday, with Verizon and AT&T down 1 percent.\nThe administration official who spoke to Reuters confirmed the gist of the Axios report and said the option was being debated at a low level in the administration and was six to eight months away from being considered by the president.\n\"This has been building for months. I don't think the White House options papers do justice to the issue. It goes much deeper,\" said Michael Wessel, a commissioner on the U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission, which works for Congress and follows China issues.\nApart from FCC chairman Pai, three of remaining four FCC commissioners also said on Monday that they opposed nationalizing the 5G network, while the fourth expressed skepticism.\nCommissioner Jessica Rosenworcel, a Democrat, said the memo \"correctly diagnoses a real problem. There is a worldwide race to lead in 5G and other nations are poised to win. But the remedy proposed here really misses the mark.\" (Reporting by Susan Heavey, Katanga Johnson and David Shepardson, additional reporting by Diane Bartz in Washington and Stephen Nellis in San Francisco; Editing by Andrew Hay and Grant McCool)", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-29T21:19:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-30T06:17:08.011+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
