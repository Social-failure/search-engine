REUTERS/James Oatway \nHe made a fast start, but was out to a fantastic catch from Aiden Markram racing in from slip after an inside edge onto his pad from a Vernon Philander (1-11) delivery. \n“It was always my dream to play test cricket and to get my first five-wicket haul, it’s very good. And to contribute to the team’s success is a good feeling,” Bumrah told SuperSport. \n“When so much is happening on the wicket you can get over-excited. That was the basic message that was given to the bowlers, not to get carried away, to bowl a disciplined line.” Slideshow (8 Images) \nThe home side started the second day on six for one after dismissing India for 187 and Hashim Amla (61) and nightwatchman Kagiso Rabada (30) put on 64 for the third wicket. \nRabada was out five minutes before lunch and South Africa then lost their way in the middle session as AB de Villiers (5), Faf du Plessis (8) and Quinton de Kock (8) all failed, the latter two out to Bumrah. \nThe Indian seamer then had Amla caught at mid-wicket, before trapping Andile Phehlukwayo (9) lbw and seeing Lungi Ngidi (0) caught by wicketkeeper Patel as the innings came to a rapid end. \n“We had to scratch around for a few runs and at one stage we were quite far behind the deficit, so to get to 190 was a decent effort,” Amla said. \nSouth Africa have an unassailable 2-0 lead in the three-match series, but are seeking a first ever clean-sweep over India.
