FUNDAMENTALS * The most active wheat futures on the Chicago Board Of Trade were up 0.1 percent at $4.16-3/4 a bushel by 0124 GMT, having closed down 1 percent on Tuesday when prices hit a low of $4.13-3/4 a bushel - the lowest since December 13, 2017. * The most active soybean futures were little changed at $9.67-1/2 a bushel, having firmed 0.8 percent on Tuesday when prices hit a high of $9.70 a bushel - the highest since January 8. * The most active corn futures were up 0.1 percent at $3.48-1/2 a bushel, having gained 0.6 percent in the previous session. * The USDA estimated 2018 U.S. winter wheat plantings at 32.608 million acres, above analyst expectations for 30.1 million to 32 million acres. * U.S. domestic demand also supported soybeans after the National Oilseed Processors Association reported a record-large December soy crush of 166.382 million bushels among its members. * Soybeans were pressured by widespread rains in Brazil over the weekend, which fuelled speculation that the world's largest exporter could harvest a larger-than-expected crop this season. MARKET NEWS * The dollar fell to a three-year low against its peers on Wednesday, with an earlier bounce sputtering as the euro edged back after shaking off a potentially negative turn in German politics. * Oil prices rose on Wednesday on tightening supply and strong global demand, although some analysts warned of a downward correction after a more than 13-percent price rise in a month. * Wall Street paused its rally on Tuesday, weighed down by weakness in General Electric shares and as lower oil prices dragged down the energy sector.
