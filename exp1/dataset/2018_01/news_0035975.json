There’s something in there for everybody,” said Laurie Metcalf, nominated for her supporting role in “Lady Bird.” \n“Shape of Water” has been celebrated as a visual feast about a woman who falls in love with a strange river creature. \n“For 25 years, I’ve been preaching that the dark poetry and emotion of my stories are fairytales for modern times,” Mexican director del Toro told Reuters. \nJenkins called it a film “about love and acceptance and empathy and not being judgmental.” \nSweeping British World War Two drama “Dunkirk,” from Warner Bros., followed with eight nominations, including for director Christopher Nolan. \nBut Fox Searchlight’s quirky “Three Billboards,” about an angry woman seeking justice for her daughter’s murder, has dominated Hollywood’s awards season so far, winning the top prize at the influential Screen Actors Guild awards on Sunday. \nIt got seven Oscar nods, with Golden Globe and Screen Actors Guild winners Frances McDormand and Sam Rockwell competing in the acting race, along with Woody Harrelson. \nEuropean betting firm Betway made “Three Billboards” favorite on Tuesday to win best picture, closely followed by “The Shape of Water.” \nThe awards will be presented in Hollywood on March 4, hosted for a second year by late night TV star Jimmy Kimmel. 23rd Critics' Choice Awards – Photo Room – Santa Monica, California, U.S., 11/01/2018 – Guillermo del Toro and cast pose backstage with their Best Picture and Best Director awards for \"The Shape of Water\".

Mary J. Blige, Octavia Spencer, Denzel Washington and Daniel Kaluuya all got acting nods. \n“Get Out,” Jordan Peele’s modern racial satire told in the form of a thriller, won directing and screenplay nominations on top of a coveted best picture nod.
