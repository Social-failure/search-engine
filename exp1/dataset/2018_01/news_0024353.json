But he stopped short of ordering any compensation. \nThe decision anonymised the name of the bank and complainant. But Steve Middleton, a spokesman for former RBS employee Mark Wright, confirmed that the case concerned Wright. \nWright has argued that the FCA should not have disclosed his name to RBS in 2013, after he made a series of allegations against the bank, because he had whistleblower protection. \nMiddleton welcomed the decision but told Reuters that Wright had battled the regulator for a “disgraceful” 10 months to establish that a whistleblower should be able to remain anonymous. \nThe FCA said in a statement that it accepted the recommendation that it apologise. \nBut it noted that relevant staff at the time were aware that the complainant had authorised a parliamentarian to raise the case with the bank and that he had disseminated details and allegations to bank staff, senior management, board members and public figures in 2012 and 2013. \nIt added: “The disclosure in question took place over four years ago and the FCA’s policies to support whistleblowing now reflect the Commissioner’s determination.” \nA RBS spokeswoman said the bank was aware of the concerns and that they had been thoroughly investigated and responded to. The bank has denied any wrongdoing.
