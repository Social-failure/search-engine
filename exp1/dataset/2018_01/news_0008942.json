This was partly because of its Swiss franc-denominated loan portfolio, which is seen by some investors as a long-term risk and means the bank must hold more capital.\nTwo sources familiar with the situation said on Tuesday that RBI had planned to create the new bank to take over the FX portfolio from Raiffeisen Bank Polska which could help to make IPO of Raiffeisen Bank Polska successful.\nBut the Polish regulator said it would not endorse the plan.\n“The commission has unanimously refused to issue an approval to launch by Raiffeisen Bank International a bank in a form of a joint-stock company,” the regulator said in a statement.\nThe regulator pointed to RBI’s failure to meet requirements to list Raiffeisen Bank Polska on the Warsaw Stock Exchange.\nRBI said its plan aimed to facilitate the IPO of Raiffeisen Bank Polska or a potential sale of a majority stake. “We continue to work with the KNF to find an acceptable structure,” it said.\nRBI Chief Executive Johann Strobl said the decision meant this specific kind of carve-out for the loan portfolio was no longer an option, but there were other ways it could split the core bank in Poland from the Swiss franc loan portfolio.\n“If we have a buyer, we can carve out the core bank so that the foreign currency portfolio remains, if they want,” he told reporters on the sidelines of a Euromoney conference on Central and Eastern Europe.\nThat was just one option, and both an IPO and a sale of the Polish unit remained possible, he said.\nIn November, sources said that BNP Paribas had approached RBI to express interest in buying the Austrian bank’s Polish division.\nReporting by Agnieszka Barteczko and Pawel Sobczak,; Additional reporting by Alexandra Schwarz-Goerlich and Francois Murphy in Vienna; editing by Louise Heavens and Jane Merriman\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-16T21:15:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-16T21:53:05.034+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
