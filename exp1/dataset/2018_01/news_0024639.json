He did not provide more details. \nTeamsters spokesman Alex Moore declined to share details of the agreement, saying union members would vote on it later in the week. \n“Workers are reporting to work as usual,” Moore wrote in an email. \nThe workers had previously rejected a management offer of a pay rise of 30 cents an hour. \nThe market serves as the city’s central distribution point for fruit and vegetables shipped in from all over the world and headed to grocery stores, restaurants and hotels.
