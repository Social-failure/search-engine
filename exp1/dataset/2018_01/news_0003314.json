The Company expects 242 Cannabis, LLC's purchase of the Property and the subsequent purchase by the Company of the 242 Shares to close on or prior to February 9,2018, and closing is subject to standard due diligence including title, environmental assessments and surveys as well as the satisfaction of conditions precedent in accordance with the purchase and sale contract.
