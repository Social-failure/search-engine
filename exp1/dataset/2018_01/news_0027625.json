The disease can be treated with a number of drugs, but resistance to these medicines is increasing, raising the risk that some strains may become untreatable in the future.\nBecause of this, the search for new medicines was becoming increasingly urgent, said Steve Oliver of Cambridge University’s biochemistry department, who co-led the work with Elizabeth Bilsland.\nAfter being transferred into a new host via a mosquito bite, malaria parasites work their way into the liver, where they mature and reproduce. They then move into red blood cells, multiply and spread around the body, causing fever and potentially life-threatening complications.\nScientists have known for some time that triclosan can halt malaria parasites’ growth at the blood stage of the infection by inhibiting the action of an enzyme known as enoyl reductase (ENR), which is involved in production of fatty acids.\nRobot Scientist ÔEveÕ is seen in an undated image handed out by Cambridge University. Cambridge University handout via REUTERS In toothpaste, this helps prevent a build-up of plaque bacteria.\nIn this latest work, however, Bilsland’s team found that triclosan also inhibits an entirely different enzyme of the malaria parasite, called DHFR.\nRobot Scientist ÔEveÕ is seen in an undated image handed out by Cambridge University. Cambridge University handout via REUTERS DHFR is the target of the antimalarial pyrimethamine - a drug to which malaria parasites are increasingly developing resistance, particularly in Africa. The Cambridge team’s work showed that triclosan was able to target and act on this enzyme even in pyrimethamine-resistant parasites.\n“The discovery by our robot colleague that triclosan is effective against malaria targets offers hope that we may be able to use it to develop a new drug,” said Elizabeth Bilsland, who co-led the work.\n“We know it is a safe compound, and its ability to target two points in the malaria parasite’s lifecycle means the parasite will find it difficult to evolve resistance.”\nThe AI robot scientist used in the study - nicknamed Eve - was designed to automate and speed up the drug discovery process.\nIt does this by automatically developing and testing hypotheses to explain observations, running experiments using laboratory robotics, interpreting the results, altering the hypotheses, and then repeating the cycle.\nEditing by Richard Balmforth\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-18T12:08:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-18T12:31:55.014+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
