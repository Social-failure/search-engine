(492 ft) and 500 m. (1,640 ft), generated ash plumes that spurted as high as 3 km (1.8 miles) above the crater, they said.\nDespite the warnings, some residents have refused to abandon the danger zone, with farmers worrying about leaving crops and cattle unattended, while others split their time between homes and evacuation centres they say are crowded and uncomfortable.\nMayla Miraflor has a vehicle loaded and ready to flee if Mayon rages unchecked.\n“We have this jeep when we need to run,” said Miraflor, who has eight children. “This is what we’ll use when the time comes. We will leave as soon as possible.”\nWriting by Enrico dela Cruz; Editing by Martin Petty and Clarence Fernandez\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-26T09:41:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-26T10:06:46.005+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
