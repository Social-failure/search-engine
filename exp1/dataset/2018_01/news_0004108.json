Fees for bonds beat mergers and acquisitions as the number one product, rising almost 15 percent to $31 billion. \nJapan Post Holdings Co Ltd ( 6178.T ), the biggest follow-on offering of the year, and Japanese SoftBank Group Corp ( 9984.T ), which agreed to buy a large number of shares of Uber Technologies Inc in late December, were the biggest corporate clients of 2017 - paying out $382 and $378 million respectively. \nJapan saw a 50 percent rise in total fees to $5.5 billion. \nBlackstone Group ( BX.N ) was the biggest financial sponsor fee payer, shelling out $679 million, an increase of 87 percent on the previous year. \nJP Morgan ( JPM.N ) was the biggest global investment banking earner of the year once again, racking up an estimated $6.7 billion in fees, or 6 percent of the total.
