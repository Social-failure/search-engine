We never thought we would win a medal in an international competition.”\nThakur is part of a new generation of gritty Indian sportswomen making history on the global stage.\nWith bolder aspirations, women are carving out roles for themselves beyond the traditional ones of wives, mothers and housekeepers.\nA female wrestler, gymnast and badminton player captured the public’s imagination in the 2016 Rio Olympics, along with the rags-to-riches stories of icons, like boxer Mary Kom, who have inspired other women to take up sport.\nThakur, an arts student from the sleepy hill station of Manali in northern India, said she started training at the age of five and was often regarded with awe for travelling alone to train in foreign destinations.\n“My father trained and treated me and my brother equally,” she said.\nHer father hopes the sport will get more attention and facilities after Aanchal’s victory.\n“Skiing is not really popular compared to other sports. Many don’t even know how to pronounce it - many call it sky-ing,” he said. (Reporting by Roli Srivastava @Rolionaroll; Editing by Katy Migiro.
