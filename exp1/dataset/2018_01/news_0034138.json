Justin Williams added a goal in the late going for Carolina, which had lost six of eight. The Hurricanes were playing for the first time since losing to Calgary 4-1 on Sunday.\nJustin Faulk added two assists and Cam Ward made 23 saves for the Hurricanes.\nTomas Tatar scored the lone goal for Detroit, which has lost four of its last five games. Jimmy Howard made 27 saves as Carolina had a 30-24 advantage in shots on goal.\nBoth teams converted on the power play in the first period. Jordan Staal snared a rebound and fed Lindholm in front of the net to put Carolina on top 2:57 into the game. The Red Wings answered at the 16:37 mark when Tatar fired in his 12th goal from the right circle. Mike Green and Dylan Larkin were credited with assists.\nThe Hurricanes outshot the Wings 13-9 during the period.\nHoward kept it deadlocked by making a pad save after Brock McGinn got behind the Detroit defense late in the second period. No penalties were called during those 20 minutes while Carolina held an 8-6 edge in shots on goal.\nLindholm banged home his own rebound to put the Hurricanes back in front. Howard made a pad save on Teuvo Teravainen and a stick save on Lindholm, but Lindholm squeezed the puck between the prone Howard and the goalpost at 6:54 of the third.\nThe Hurricanes had the man advantage after Xavier Ouellet was whistled for interference.\nCarolina dodged a bullet with under four minutes left when Martin Frk hit the goalpost.\nHoward made a couple of stops but couldn’t secure the puck before Williams scored his eighth goal with under two minutes remaining to make it 3-1.\nDetroit had a power play for the final 1:45 but couldn’t convert.\nThe teams will face each other twice more next month.\n--Field Level Media\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-01-21T11:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-21T13:23:19.001+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
