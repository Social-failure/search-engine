Instead, Davos regular Anthony Scaramucci represented the incoming administration at the annual gathering of elites in the Swiss mountains.\nDespite his absence, the then-president-elect's shadow loomed large over Davos in 2017.\nWithout mentioning Trump by name, China President Xi Jinping made a widely attended speech arguing that globalization has fueled global growth , and should not be blamed for the world's problems. Xi also asserted that a global trade war would have no winners.\nFollowing Xi's speech, Scaramucci also sought to calm trade war anxieties and said that China and the U.S. have a \"common cause.\" He said that the U.S. does want \"free and fair trade.\"\n\"All we're asking for now is to create more symmetry in these trade agreements,\" Scaramucci said.\nTrump's attendance this year comes as the president continues to characterize America's relationship with other leading economies as a \" very one-sided and unfair one \" and \"just not sustainable.\"\nThe U.S. president has repeatedly called for reform to shrink the \"huge\" annual trade deficit, including a November speech in Beijing where he shared the stage with Xi.\nâ€” CNBC's Everett Rosenfeld, Matt Clinch and Arjun Kharpal contributed to this report.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-09T18:53:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-09T19:08:57.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
