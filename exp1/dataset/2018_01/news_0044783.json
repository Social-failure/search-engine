Fourth quarter 2017 earnings per common share was impacted by $3.3 million in merger-related expenses and a $1.0 million deferred tax asset write-down due to the change in the statutory federal corporate tax rate under the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017. Operating earnings per diluted common share was $0.41 for the fourth quarter 2017, compared to $0.34 per diluted common share in the fourth quarter 2016. For the year ended December 31, 2017, net income was $38.6 million or $1.38 per basic common share and $1.36 per diluted common share, compared to $24.7 million, or $1.06 per basic common share and $1.05 per diluted common share, in 2016.\n“We are proud of our fourth quarter and year end results,” said Paul W. Taylor, President and Chief Executive Officer of Guaranty Bancorp. “We had record net income of $38.6 million for the year, an increase of 56.2% compared to the prior year. This record income was fueled by balance sheet growth, an expanded net interest margin and improved profitability. Our successful integration of Castle Rock Bank in the fourth quarter of 2017 has positioned us well in Douglas County, Colorado, one of the fastest growing counties in the country. Along with our growth, we continue to deliver improved profitability, demonstrated by the increase in our 2017 GAAP return on average assets to 1.12% compared to 0.93% in 2016 and an increase in our 2017 operating return on average assets to 1.25% compared to 1.09% in 2016.”\nTaylor continued, “I am also pleased to announce that on January 16, 2018, we acquired the assets of Wagner Wealth Management and have integrated them into our wholly owned subsidiary, Private Capital Management LLC. As a result, Private Capital Management LLC now has over $1.1 billion in assets under management. This acquisition further strengthens our wealth management strategy and desire to offer comprehensive financial solutions to our customers.”\n1 This press release contains certain non-GAAP financial measures to provide meaningful supplemental information regarding the Company’s operational performance and to enhance investors’ overall understanding of the Company’s core financial performance.

(3) The loan average balances and rates include nonaccrual loans. (4) Includes Bankers’ Bank of the West stock, Federal Reserve Bank stock, Federal Home Loan Bank stock and Pacific Coast Bankers’ Bank stock. Net interest income increased $4.0 million in the fourth quarter 2017, compared to the same quarter in 2016, and increased $0.5 million, compared to the third quarter 2017. The increase in net interest income was driven by an increase in average earning assets and the accretion of the discount on loans acquired in the Home State and Castle Rock transactions. Third quarter 2017 net interest income included a $0.9 million interest recovery on an impaired loan paid off during the quarter.\nNet interest margin and loan yield were favorably impacted by the accretion of the discount on loans acquired in the Home State transaction in the third quarter 2016 and loans acquired in the Castle Rock transaction in the fourth quarter 2017. Accretion on acquired loans was $1.4 million in the fourth quarter 2017, compared to $1.0 million in the third quarter 2017, and $1.0 million in the fourth quarter 2016. Fourth quarter 2017 interest income included $0.9 million in accreted discount on loans paid off during the quarter.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017, net interest income increased $30.4 million compared to the prior year, primarily due to a $696.0 million, or 27.7% increase in average earning assets, partially offset by a $486.4 million, or 29.0% increase in average interest bearing liabilities. Accretion of discount on acquired loans was $4.4 million during 2017, compared to $1.3 million in 2016. The Company acquired $445.5 million in loans and $769.7 million in deposits as a result of the September 2016 Home State transaction. The Company acquired $71.1 million in loans and $128.4 million in deposits as a result of the October 2017 Castle Rock transaction.\nNoninterest Income\nThe following table presents noninterest income as of the dates indicated:\nQuarter Ended Year Ended December 31,\n2017 September 30,\n2017 December 31,\n2016 December 31,\n2017 December 31,\n2016 (In thousands) Noninterest income: Deposit service and other fees $ 3,546 $ 3,580 $ 3,405 $ 13,951 $ 10,447 Investment management and trust 1,523 1,478 1,563 6,005 5,452 Increase in cash surrender value of life insurance 675 674 607 2,559 2,005 Gain (loss) on sale of securities 80 (86 ) 49 (6 ) (73 ) Gain on sale of SBA loans 285 143 401 1,256 873 Other 461 341 207 1,679 553 Total noninterest income $ 6,570 $ 6,130 $ 6,232 $ 25,444 $ 19,257 Beginning late in the third quarter 2016, noninterest income was favorably impacted by the Home State transaction, affecting deposit service and other fees, debit card interchange fees, and investment management and trust income.\nNoninterest income increased $0.3 million in the fourth quarter 2017, compared to the same quarter in 2016 and increased $0.4 million, compared to the third quarter 2017. The $0.3 million increase in noninterest income in the fourth quarter 2017, compared to the same quarter in 2016, was primarily due to an increase in interest rate swap fees. The $0.4 million increase in noninterest income in the fourth quarter 2017, compared to the third quarter 2017, was primarily due to a $0.2 million increase in interest rate swap fees and a $0.2 million increase in gain on sales of securities.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017, noninterest income increased $6.2 million, or 32.1%, compared to the same period in 2016. In addition to the impact of the Home State transaction, gain on sales of SBA loans increased $0.4 million, bank-owned life insurance income increased $0.6 million, and interest rate swap fees increased $0.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to the prior year. The Company also recorded a $0.3 million gain on sale of its $2.0 million credit card loan portfolio, included in other noninterest income in the table above, in the first quarter 2017.\nOn January 16, 2018, the Company subsidiary, Private Capital Management LLC, closed on its acquisition of the assets of Wagner Wealth Management, LLC, increasing its assets under management to over $1.1 billion on a pro-forma basis at December 31, 2017. Including the assets under management in our trust division of the Bank, the Company’s total assets under management was over $1.4 billion on a pro-forma basis at December 31, 2017.\nNoninterest Expense\nThe following table presents noninterest expense as of the dates indicated:\nQuarter Ended Year Ended December 31,\n2017 September 30,\n2017 December 31,\n2016 December 31,\n2017 December 31,\n2016 (In thousands) Noninterest expense: Salaries and employee benefits $ 11,853 $ 11,736 $ 12,654 $ 46,762 $ 40,946 Occupancy expense 1,724 1,714 1,834 6,664 5,887 Furniture and equipment 1,004 974 789 3,898 3,070 Amortization of intangible assets 776 672 689 2,745 1,557 Other real estate owned, net - (20 ) 4 174 31 Insurance and assessments 671 642 496 2,666 2,314 Professional fees 974 929 914 4,129 3,639 Impairment of long-lived assets 170 - 185 394 185 Other general and administrative 6,784 5,160 5,672 19,363 15,158 Total noninterest expense $ 23,956 $ 21,807 $ 23,237 $ 86,795 $ 72,787 Noninterest expense increased $0.7 million for the fourth quarter 2017, compared to the same quarter in 2016, mostly due to a $0.3 million increase in merger-related expenses, described below, and a $0.5 million increase in employee incentive and bonus expense. Noninterest expense increased $2.1 million for the fourth quarter 2017, compared to the third quarter 2017, primarily due to the $3.0 million increase in merger-related expenses described below, partially offset by a $1.6 million settlement related to a commercial real estate matter incurred in the third quarter 2017, included in other general and administrative expense in the table above.\nDuring the fourth quarter 2017, merger-related expenses related to the Castle Rock acquisition were $3.3 million and were included in other general and administrative expense. During the fourth quarter 2016, merger-related expenses for the Home State acquisition were $3.0 million, consisting of $0.5 million in salaries and employee benefits expense and $2.5 million in other general and administrative expense.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017, noninterest expense increased $14.0 million, compared to the same period in 2016, primarily due to the overall growth of the Company, including the acquisition of Home State in September 2016 and the acquisition of Castle Rock in October 2017. Although noninterest expense increased in 2017 compared to 2016, noninterest expense as a percentage of average assets declined from 2.73% in 2016 to 2.51% in 2017.\nThe largest drivers of the $14.0 million increase in noninterest expense for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to 2016, were a $5.8 million increase in salaries and employee benefits and a $4.2 million increase in other general and administrative expense. The increase in employee salary and benefits for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to 2016, was primarily due to a $3.1 million increase in base salaries and a $1.6 million increase in employee benefit costs. Average full-time equivalent employees increased from 421 for the year ended December 31, 2016 to 496 for the year ended December 31, 2017, mostly due to the acquisition of Home State. The increase in other general and administrative expense for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to 2016, was primarily due to a $1.6 million settlement of a litigation claim mentioned above, a $1.4 million increase in data processing expense, a $0.7 million increase in debit card interchange expense and a $0.4 million increase in communication expense.\nMerger-related expenses for the year ended December 31, 2017 were $3.6 million, primarily related to the Castle Rock acquisition and included in other general and administrative expense. Merger-related expenses for the year ended December 31, 2016 were $6.3 million, related to the Home State acquisition and consisted of $1.9 million in salaries and employee benefits consisting of severance and retention payments, and $4.4 million in other general and administrative expense.\nTax Expense\nIn December 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 was signed into law. This new tax law reduced the statutory federal corporate tax rate from 35.0% to 21.0%. The impact on the Company’s net deferred tax asset resulted in a tax write-down of $1.0 million and is expected to lower the Company’s effective tax rate to approximately 22% to 23% in 2018.\nBalance Sheet\nDecember 31, September 30, June 30, March 31, December 31, 2017 2017 2017 2017 2016 (Dollars in thousands) Total assets $ 3,698,890 $ 3,510,046 $ 3,403,852 $ 3,399,651 $ 3,366,427 Average assets, quarter-to-date 3,603,552 3,423,224 3,404,109 3,374,153 3,336,143 Total loans, net of deferred fees and costs 2,807,388 2,661,866 2,578,472 2,570,750 2,519,138 Total deposits 2,941,627 2,898,060 2,763,623 2,765,630 2,699,084 Equity ratio - GAAP 10.95 % 10.69 % 10.80 % 10.56 % 10.47 % Tangible common equity ratio (1) 8.99 % 8.88 % 8.91 % 8.65 % 8.52 % (1) See reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures to the corresponding GAAP measurement in \"Non-GAAP Financial Measures\" later in this document.

In addition to contractual loan principal payments and maturities, the fourth quarter 2017 included $44.5 million in early payoffs related to our borrowers selling their assets, $20.6 million in loan payoffs related to our strategic decision to not match certain financing terms offered by competitors, and $9.7 million in loan pay-downs related to fluctuations in loan balances to existing customers.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017, loans net of deferred costs and fees increased by $288.3 million, or 11.4%, primarily due to a 13.1% increase in commercial loans and an 11.8% increase in commercial and residential real estate loans.\nThe following table sets forth the amounts of deposits outstanding at the dates indicated:\nDecember 31, September 30, June 30, March 31, December 31, 2017 2017 2017 2017 2016 (In thousands) Noninterest-bearing demand $ 939,550 $ 924,361 $ 876,043 $ 868,189 $ 916,632 Interest-bearing demand and NOW 813,882 866,309 811,639 821,518 767,523 Money market 527,621 502,400 475,656 489,921 484,664 Savings 201,687 183,366 183,200 178,157 164,478 Time 458,887 421,624 417,085 407,845 365,787 Total deposits $ 2,941,627 $ 2,898,060 $ 2,763,623 $ 2,765,630 $ 2,699,084 At December 31, 2017, deposits increased $242.5 million compared to December 31, 2016. The year-over-year increase in deposits was attributable to organic growth and $128.4 million in deposits acquired in the October 27, 2017 Castle Rock transaction. During the fourth quarter 2017, average deposits increased $139.0 million compared to the third quarter 2017. During the fourth quarter 2017, the balances of several of our large commercial deposit customers decreased due to normal cash flow fluctuations. At December 31, 2017, noninterest-bearing deposits as a percentage of total deposits were 31.9%, compared to 31.9% at September 30, 2017 and 34.0% at December 31, 2016.\nRegulatory Capital Ratios\nThe following table provides the capital ratios of the Company and the Bank as of the dates presented, along with the applicable regulatory capital requirements:\nRatio at\nDecember 31,\n2017 Ratio at\nDecember 31,\n2016 Minimum Requirement\nfor “Adequately Capitalized”\nInstitution plus fully\nphased in Capital\nConservation Buffer Minimum\nRequirement for\n\"Well-Capitalized\"\nInstitution Common Equity Tier 1 Risk-Based Capital Ratio Consolidated 10.57 % 10.46 % 7.00 % N/A Guaranty Bank and Trust Company 12.29 % 12.43 % 7.00 % 6.50 % Tier 1 Risk-Based Capital Ratio Consolidated 11.36 % 11.34 % 8.50 % N/A Guaranty Bank and Trust Company 12.29 % 12.43 % 8.50 % 8.00 % Total Risk-Based Capital Ratio Consolidated 13.36 % 13.58 % 10.50 % N/A Guaranty Bank and Trust Company 13.03 % 13.26 % 10.50 % 10.00 % Leverage Ratio Consolidated 10.21 % 9.81 % 4.00 % N/A Guaranty Bank and Trust Company 11.05 % 10.76 % 4.00 % 5.00 % At December 31, 2017, all of our regulatory capital ratios remained well above minimum requirements for a “well-capitalized” institution. Our consolidated total risk-based capital ratio decreased compared to December 31, 2016, primarily due to an increase in risk-based assets during the year ended December 31, 2017. At December 31, 2017, most of our bank-level capital ratios had declined compared to December 31, 2016, primarily due to the $18.7 million dividend paid to the Company in the second quarter 2017 to fund stockholder dividends and debt servicing during 2017.\nAsset Quality\nThe following table presents select asset quality data, including quarterly charged-off loans, recoveries and provision for loan losses as of the dates indicated:\nDecember 31, September 30, June 30, March 31, December 31, 2017 2017 2017 2017 2016 (Dollars in thousands) Originated nonaccrual loans $ 3,932 $ 3,935 $ 3,332 $ 3,387 $ 3,345 Purchased credit impaired loans 1,622 809 1,290 1,715 1,902 Accruing loans past due 90 days or more (1) - - - - - Total nonperforming loans (NPLs) $ 5,554 $ 4,744 $ 4,622 $ 5,102 $ 5,247 Other real estate owned and foreclosed assets 761 - 113 257 569 Total nonperforming assets (NPAs) $ 6,315 $ 4,744 $ 4,735 $ 5,359 $ 5,816 Total classified assets $ 28,330 $ 28,186 $ 29,188 $ 30,201 $ 33,443 Accruing loans past due 30-89 days (1) $ 2,869 $ 9,129 $ 957 $ 3,858 $ 1,337 Charged-off loans $ (117 ) $ (970 ) $ (338 ) $ (125 ) $ (290 ) Recoveries 183 248 82 45 150 Net (charge-offs) recoveries $ 66 $ (722 ) $ (256 ) $ (80 ) $ (140 ) Provision for loan losses $ 284 $ 497 $ 206 $ 5 $ 90 Allowance for loan losses $ 23,250 $ 22,900 $ 23,125 $ 23,175 $ 23,250 Unaccreted loan discount (2) $ 13,049 $ 11,654 $ 12,665 $ 13,896 $ 14,682 Selected ratios: NPLs to loans, net of deferred fees and costs (3) 0.20 % 0.18 % 0.18 % 0.20 % 0.21 % NPAs to total assets 0.17 % 0.14 % 0.14 % 0.16 % 0.17 % Allowance for loan losses to NPLs 418.62 % 482.72 % 500.32 % 454.23 % 443.11 % Allowance for loan losses to loans, net of deferred fees and costs (3) 0.83 % 0.86 % 0.90 % 0.90 % 0.92 % Loans 30-89 days past due to loans, net of deferred fees and costs (3) 0.10 % 0.34 % 0.04 % 0.15 % 0.05 % Texas ratio (4) 1.53 % 1.22 % 1.26 % 1.39 % 1.55 % Classified asset ratio (5) 7.43 % 7.57 % 8.08 % 8.24 % 9.79 % (1) Past due loans include both loans that are past due with respect to payments and loans that are past due because the loan has matured, and is in the process of renewal, but continues to be current with respect to payments.

As a result of the Castle Rock transaction, the Company acquired $1.6 million of nonperforming loans and $0.8 million of other real estate owned. At December 31, 2017, performing troubled debt restructurings were $18.1 million, compared to $11.0 million at September 30, 2017 and $25.1 million at December 31, 2016. The increase in performing troubled debt restructurings in the fourth quarter 2017, compared to the third quarter 2017, was due to the modification of a single commercial loan. The year-over-year decrease in performing troubled debt restructurings was primarily due to the payoff of a $9.4 million out-of-state loan syndication during the third quarter 2017, partially offset by the modification of a single commercial loan during the fourth quarter 2017. The increase in loans 30-89 days past due during the fourth quarter 2017, compared to the fourth quarter 2016, was mostly due to a single commercial loan relationship.\nNet recoveries were $0.1 million during the fourth quarter 2017, compared to net charge-offs of $0.7 million during the third quarter 2017 and net charge-offs of $0.1 million in the fourth quarter 2016. During the fourth quarter 2017, the Bank recorded a $0.3 million provision for loan losses, compared to a $0.5 million provision in the third quarter 2017 and a $0.1 million provision in the fourth quarter 2016. The Bank considered recoveries, historical charge-offs, the level of nonperforming loans, loan growth and other factors when determining the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses and the resulting amount of loan loss provision to be recognized during the quarter.\nShares Outstanding\nAs of December 31, 2017, the Company had 29,222,264 shares of voting common stock outstanding, of which 434,149 shares were in the form of unvested stock awards.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nThe Company discloses certain non-GAAP financial measures related to tangible assets, including tangible book value and tangible common equity, and operating earnings adjusted for merger-related expenses, OREO expenses, debt termination expense, impairments of long-lived assets, litigation-related settlements, securities gains and losses, net deferred tax asset write-downs and gains or losses on the sale or disposal of other assets. The Company also discloses the following GAAP profitability metrics alongside the operating earnings equivalent: return on average assets, return on average equity and earnings per share (diluted).\nThe Company discloses these non-GAAP financial measures to provide meaningful supplemental information regarding the Company’s operational performance and to enhance investors’ overall understanding of the Company’s core financial performance.
