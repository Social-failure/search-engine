The three major U.S. indexes rose on Friday, marking their third straight week of gains.\nThe yield on benchmark 10-year Treasury notes reached a three-year peak at 2.659 percent, meanwhile.\nThe dollar held steady against a basket of currencies but still ended lower for a fifth straight week, the longest such streak since April-May 2015.\nSpot gold was up about 0.4 percent at $1,331.84 an ounce, retreating from Monday’s four-month highs.\nIn the aftermath of the last shutdown in October 2013, which lasted for 16 days, the S&P 500 posted a modest 3 percent gain. Gold, the dollar and the 10-year yield barely changed.\nEven if a shutdown begins this weekend, most analysts and investors suspect it will be short lived.\n“It’s still seen as a short-term event,” said Vassili Serebriakov, currency strategist at Credit Agricole in New York.\nAdditional reporting by Chuck Mikolajczak, Sinead Carew and Saqib Iqbal Ahmed; Editing by Tom Brown\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-22T16:46:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-22T17:15:14.003+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
