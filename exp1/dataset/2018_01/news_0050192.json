It is the third election since protests in 2011 unseated long-time ruler Hosni Mubarak. \nSeveral leading opposition figures called on Sunday for an election boycott, blaming repression that has cleared the field of challengers and left Sisi’s top opponent in jail. \nAt the time of Mousa’s registration, his personal Facebook page included a cover photo with Sisi’s face and “we support you as president of Egypt” written beneath it. \n“We were supporting President Sisi before the decision to participate was taken,” deputy head of the Ghad party Mahmoud Mousa told Reuters. \n“We have a respectable program that we are offering to the Egyptian people and we are presenting ourselves just like any other candidate would,” he said. \nMousa said he registered his candidacy at the electoral commission after having collected the required number of nomination pledges, submitting his official paperwork just minutes before the final deadline.

REUTERS/Mohamed Abd El Ghany \nWould-be candidates were required to register by 2 p.m. (1200 GMT) on Monday after clinching at least 20 nominations from parliament or 25,000 pledges from citizens across the country. \nMousa said he had netted 47,000 pledges and the backing of 27 lawmakers. The electoral commission said last week that Sisi had earned more than 1 million pledges. Over 500 of parliament’s 595 lawmakers had already pledged support for Sisi.
