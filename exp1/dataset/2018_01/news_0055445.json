Commodities funds took in $1.4 billion, their best showing since July 2016.\n“We’ve had a lot of cash on the sidelines for so many years, but as we continue to march forward, especially on the equity side of things, you see great optimism not only by institutional investors but retail investors as well,” said Wayne Wicker, chief investment officer at ICMA Retirement Corp.\n“There seems to be some pressure on individuals that haven’t participated to reallocate.”\nThe broad buying comes as investors feed a desire for greater returns using both bonds and stocks. Rising yields during the week hurt bond prices but also attracted new investors seeking a better entry point.\nStock buyers have also been conditioned to “buy the dip,” and they are starting to warm up to domestic equities in a serious way after three straight years of profit-taking outflows from such funds.\nDomestic equity funds attracted $12.9 billion in the latest week, while world stock funds gathered $10.5 billion, ICI said.\nIn more recent days, as equities sold off partly in response to rising yields, investors kept buying stocks.\nThe SPDR S&P 500 ETF took in a combined $8.4 billion of assets on Monday and Tuesday this week, according to a spokesman for the fund’s issuer, even as the Dow Jones Industrial Average registered its biggest two-day drop since September 2016.\nNegative returns in many bond funds so far this year have failed to deter investors from piling into debt markets, which have pulled in hundreds of billions of cash from investors since the 2007-2009 global financial crisis.\nDuring the most recent week, taxable bonds pulled in $12.7 billion and municipal bonds pulled in $2.5 billion, according to ICI.\nSales of commodity funds, meanwhile, have started to perk up, after a long slumber, on speculation that inflation is on the rise.\nThe following table shows estimated ICI flows for mutual funds and ETFs (all figures in million of dollars):\n1/24 1/17 1/10 1/3/2018 12/27/2017\nEquity 23,395 11,874 17,377 -20,997 4,089\nDomestic 12,911 1,720 3,637 -22,058 1,202\nWorld 10,484 10,155 13,739 1,061 2,886\nHybrid 101 -237 -149 -327 -940\nBond 15,122 9,250 18,916 7,566 4,116\nTaxable 12,659 6,794 15,760 7,057 4,494\nMunicipal 2,462 2,457 3,156 509 -378\nCommodity 1,412 45 -2 -305 -296\nTotal 40,029 20,932 36,142 -14,064 6,968\nReporting by Trevor Hunnicutt\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-01T03:41:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-31T23:32:51.037+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
