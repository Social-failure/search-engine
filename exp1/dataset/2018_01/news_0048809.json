But the rebels launched a new offensive when the ceasefire expired earlier this month, killing security force members, bombing major oil pipelines and kidnapping an oil contractor.\nA larger rebel group, the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC), demobilized under a 2016 peace deal with the government. It is now a political party known as the Revolutionary Alternative Common Force.\nIn a statement on Monday, the ELN said it would support a new ceasefire but that attacks would continue in the absence of one.\nSantos, who won a Nobel Peace prize in 2016 for clinching peace with the FARC, had already recalled his negotiator from Quito talks after the ELN rebels launched this month’s offensive.\n“I will continue to work for peace, to build peace, until the final day of my government and until the final day of my life, because nothing is more important,” Santos said.\nSantos leaves office in August after two four-year terms.\nThe ELN, founded by radical Roman Catholic priests in 1964, has sought peace with the government before but made little progress. It is considered a terrorist group by the United States and European Union.\nA man arrested after the first bombing in Barranquilla had been detained in 2015 in connection with an ELN cell, Villegas said, and the group was also responsible for a police station bombing in Ecuador on Saturday. No one was killed in that attack.\nReporting by Helen Murphy; Editing by Alistair Bell\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-29T20:28:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-29T20:48:49.041+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
