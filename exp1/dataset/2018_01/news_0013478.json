Sam’s Club is closing underperforming stores in Alaska, Texas, New Jersey and other states, this person said. \nRead: Wal-Mart to offer one-time bonus of up to $1,000—but only for 20-year veterans \nThe average Sam’s Club employs around 160 workers, so the closures will eliminate around 10,000 jobs. Some workers will be offered roles at other locations, the company said. \nThe move comes the same day that Wal-Mart WMT, +0.35% said it plans to raise wages for its U.S. hourly workers to $11 and pay a special bonus of up to $1,000 per individual. Sam’s Club employees affected by the closures will be offered 60 days paid severance and receive the one-time bonus announced Thursday, said the person familiar with the plans.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-11T23:43:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-11T23:57:03.019+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
