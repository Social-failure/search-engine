The company aims to ramp up production to about one billion tonnes by 2022.\nThe move would help all of Coal India’s seven units produce over 100 million tonnes per annum, and reduce the country’s dependence on imported fuel, Goyal said.\nIndia imported about 190 million tonnes of coal in the year ended March 2017.\nEnvironmentalists worry that despite India’s commitment to renewable energy, the country’s rising use of coal at a time when many Western nations are rejecting the dirty fossil fuel will hamper the global fight against climate change.\nReporting by Sudarshan Varadhan; Editing by Sanjeev Miglani and Adrian Croft\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-19T16:18:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-19T16:35:07.023+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
