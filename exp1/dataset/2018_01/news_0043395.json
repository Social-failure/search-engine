I'm proud of our bankers for the resiliency they showed while maintaining a client centric focus during our executive succession activities. With the completion of our merger with Pacific Continental Corporation, we are excited to welcome a new group of talented bankers and an exceptional customer base to Columbia.\" Mr. Robbins continued, \"While competitive pressures dampened loan growth, we had another solid year of production as our bankers grew relationships on both sides of the balance sheet. Our full year record earnings were helped, in part, by rising interest rates as evidenced by the 26 basis point expansion in our operating net interest margin during the year.\"\nSignificant Influences on the Quarter Ended December 31, 2017\nPacific Continental Acquisition\nOn November 1, 2017, we completed our acquisition of Pacific Continental Corporation. The table below summarizes the amounts recognized at the acquisition date for each major class of assets acquired and liabilities assumed:\nNovember 1, 2017\n(in thousands)\nMerger consideration\n$\n637,103\nIdentifiable net assets acquired, at fair value\nAssets acquired\nCash and cash equivalents\n$\n81,190\nInvestment securities\n449,291\nFederal Home Loan Bank stock\n7,084\nLoans\n1,873,987\nInterest receivable\n7,827\nPremises and equipment\n27,343\nOther real estate owned\n10,279\nCore deposit intangible\n46,875\nOther assets\n50,638\nTotal assets acquired\n2,554,514\nLiabilities assumed\nDeposits\n(2,118,982)\nFederal Home Loan Bank advances\n(101,127)\nSubordinated debentures\n(35,678)\nJunior subordinated debentures\n(14,434)\nSecurities sold under agreements to repurchase\n(1,617)\nOther liabilities\n(28,653)\nTotal liabilities assumed\n(2,300,491)\nTotal identifiable net assets acquired, at fair value\n254,023\nGoodwill\n$\n383,080\nIn addition to the balance sheet impacts shown above, our reported net income for the current quarter was negatively impacted by $13.6 million in acquisition-related expenses stemming from the Pacific Continental transaction. Those charges impacted diluted earnings per share by approximately $0.13.\nIncome Taxes\nOn December 22, 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act was enacted into law. Beginning in 2018, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act reduces the federal tax rate for corporations from 35% to 21% and changes or limits certain deductions. As a result of the lower corporate tax rate, during the current quarter, we recorded a re-measurement charge of $12.2 million to reduce our deferred tax assets. This adjustment increased provision for income taxes and negatively impacted diluted earnings per share by approximately $0.18.\nOur effective tax rate for the current quarter was 61.5%, compared to 31.0% and 28.6% for the linked and prior year periods, respectively. The increase in the effective tax rate during the quarter resulted from the re-measurement of deferred tax assets.\nThe effective tax rate for 2017 was 36.6%, compared to 30.0% in 2016. The increase in 2017 was, again, related to the re-measurement of deferred tax assets. For 2018, we expect our effective tax rate to be approximately 19%.\nBalance Sheet\nTotal assets at December 31, 2017 were $12.72 billion, an increase of $2.90 billion from September 30, 2017. Loans were $8.36 billion, up $1.85 billion from September 30, 2017 due to the acquisition of Pacific Continental as well as strong loan originations of $377.7 million. Securities available for sale were $2.74 billion at December 31, 2017, an increase of $535.0 million, or 24% from $2.21 billion at September 30, 2017, again, primarily due to the Pacific Continental acquisition. Total deposits at December 31, 2017 were $10.53 billion, an increase of $2.19 billion from September 30, 2017 primarily due to the acquisition of Pacific Continental. Core deposits comprised 95% of total deposits and were $10.04 billion at December 31, 2017, an increase of $2.04 billion from September 30, 2017. The average cost of total deposits for the quarter was 0.08%, an increase of 3 basis points from the third quarter of 2017.\nIncome Statement\nNet Interest Income\nNet interest income for the fourth quarter of 2017 was $106.2 million, an increase of $17.3 million from the linked period and an increase of $20.5 million from the prior year period. The increase from both the linked and prior year periods was primarily due to income from earning assets acquired in the Pacific Continental transaction. The increase from the prior year period was partially offset by $1.5 million lower incremental accretion income from purchased loans. For additional information regarding net interest income, see the \"Net Interest Margin\" section and the \"Average Balances and Rates\" table.\nNoninterest Income\nNoninterest income was $23.6 million for the fourth quarter of 2017, a decrease of $13.5 million from the third quarter of 2017. The linked quarter decrease was principally due to the $14.0 million gain on the sale of the merchant card services portfolio recorded in the third quarter. Compared to the fourth quarter of 2016, noninterest income increased by $1.3 million principally due to a current quarter BOLI benefit of $1.2 million recognized in other noninterest income.\nNoninterest Expense\nTotal noninterest expense for the fourth quarter of 2017 was $85.6 million, an increase of $18.1 million from the third quarter of 2017. The increase was primarily due to $13.6 million of acquisition-related expenses recorded in the current quarter compared to $1.2 million of such expenses in the linked quarter. The remaining increase was from additional, ongoing expenses resulting from the Pacific Continental acquisition. Compared to the fourth quarter of 2016, noninterest expense increased $20.6 million. This increase was also driven by higher acquisition-related expenses in the current quarter as well as additional, ongoing expenses resulting from the recent acquisition.\nNet Interest Margin\nColumbia's net interest margin (tax equivalent) for the fourth quarter of 2017 was 4.20%, unchanged from the linked quarter and an increase of 9 basis points from the prior year period. The increase from the prior year quarter was due to higher yield on loans as well as higher loan volumes, partially offset by lower incremental accretion. Columbia's operating net interest margin(tax equivalent) (1) was 4.25% for the fourth quarter of 2017, an increase of 10 basis points from the linked quarter and an increase of 26 basis points from the prior year period due to higher loan yields and volumes.\nThe following table shows the impact to interest income resulting from income accretion on acquired loan portfolios as well as the net interest margin and operating net interest margin:\nThree Months Ended\nTwelve Months Ended\nDecember 31,\nSeptember 30,\nJune 30,\nMarch 31,\nDecember 31,\nDecember 31,\nDecember 31,\n2017\n2017\n2017\n2017\n2016\n2017\n2016\n(dollars in thousands)\nIncremental accretion income due to:\nFDIC purchased credit impaired loans\n$\n265\n$\n972\n$\n753\n$\n2,117\n$\n1,199\n$\n4,107\n$\n5,972\nOther acquired loans\n2,482\n1,903\n2,356\n1,948\n3,087\n8,689\n11,983\nIncremental accretion income\n$\n2,747\n$\n2,875\n$\n3,109\n$\n4,065\n$\n4,286\n$\n12,796\n$\n17,955\nNet interest margin (tax equivalent)\n4.20\n%\n4.20\n%\n4.12\n%\n4.20\n%\n4.11\n%\n4.18\n%\n4.12\n%\nOperating net interest margin (tax equivalent) (1)\n4.25\n%\n4.15\n%\n4.09\n%\n4.09\n%\n3.99\n%\n4.15\n%\n4.01\n%\n(1) Operating net interest margin (tax equivalent) is a non-GAAP financial measure.

Total nonperforming assets increased $35.5 million from the linked quarter due to a $19.1 million increase attributable to the Pacific Continental acquisition with the remaining $16.4 million increase from non-acquired nonperforming assets.\nThe following table sets forth information regarding nonaccrual loans and total nonperforming assets:\nDecember 31, 2017\nSeptember 30, 2017\nDecember 31, 2016\n(in thousands)\nNonaccrual loans:\nCommercial business\n$\n45,460\n$\n25,213\n$\n11,555\nReal estate:\nOne-to-four family residential\n785\n816\n568\nCommercial and multifamily residential\n13,941\n9,143\n11,187\nTotal real estate\n14,726\n9,959\n11,755\nReal estate construction:\nOne-to-four family residential\n1,854\n239\n563\nTotal real estate construction\n1,854\n239\n563\nConsumer\n4,149\n4,906\n3,883\nTotal nonaccrual loans\n66,189\n40,317\n27,756\nOther real estate owned and other personal property owned\n13,298\n3,682\n5,998\nTotal nonperforming assets\n$\n79,487\n$\n43,999\n$\n33,754\nThe following table provides an analysis of the Company's allowance for loan and lease losses:\nThree Months Ended\nTwelve Months Ended\nDecember 31,\n2017\nSeptember 30,\n2017\nDecember 31,\n2016\nDecember 31,\n2017\nDecember 31,\n2016\n(in thousands)\nBeginning balance\n$\n71,616\n$\n72,984\n$\n70,264\n$\n70,043\n$\n68,172\nCharge-offs:\nCommercial business\n(1,524)\n(1,362)\n(1,195)\n(7,613)\n(10,068)\nOne-to-four family residential real estate\n—\n—\n—\n(460)\n(35)\nCommercial and multifamily residential real estate\n(287)\n—\n(63)\n(287)\n(89)\nOne-to-four family residential real estate construction\n—\n—\n(88)\n(14)\n(88)\nConsumer\n(318)\n(263)\n(255)\n(1,474)\n(1,238)\nPurchased credit impaired\n(1,440)\n(1,633)\n(2,118)\n(6,812)\n(9,944)\nTotal charge-offs\n(3,569)\n(3,258)\n(3,719)\n(16,660)\n(21,462)\nRecoveries:\nCommercial business\n839\n688\n377\n4,836\n2,646\nOne-to-four family residential real estate\n188\n40\n29\n568\n171\nCommercial and multifamily residential real estate\n412\n58\n1,182\n675\n1,401\nOne-to-four family residential real estate construction\n71\n20\n11\n178\n291\nCommercial and multifamily residential real estate construction\n1\n—\n—\n1\n109\nConsumer\n311\n343\n168\n1,187\n933\nPurchased credit impaired\n2,450\n1,389\n1,713\n6,187\n7,004\nTotal recoveries\n4,272\n2,538\n3,480\n13,632\n12,555\nNet recoveries (charge-offs)\n703\n(720)\n(239)\n(3,028)\n(8,907)\nProvision (recapture) for loan and lease losses\n3,327\n(648)\n18\n8,631\n10,778\nEnding balance\n$\n75,646\n$\n71,616\n$\n70,043\n$\n75,646\n$\n70,043\nThe allowance for loan losses to period end loans was 0.91% at December 31, 2017 compared to 1.10% at September 30, 2017. For the fourth quarter of 2017, Columbia recorded a net provision for loan and lease losses of $3.3 million compared to a net provision recovery of $648 thousand for the linked quarter and a net provision of $18 thousand for the comparable quarter last year. The net provision for loan and lease losses recorded during the current quarter consisted of $4.8 million of provision for loan losses for loans, excluding PCI loans (inclusive of a $1.9 million provision related to Pacific Continental), and a provision recovery of $1.5 million for PCI loans.\nAndy McDonald, Columbia's Executive Vice President and Chief Credit Officer, commented, \"Our nonperforming assets ratio ticked-up to sixty three basis points at year-end 2017. The increase was situational rather than a shift in the portfolio and was primarily driven by one specific credit downgrade along with the addition of Pacific Continental's activity, which accounted for 15 basis points of the total.\"\nOrganizational Update\nMr. Robbins commented, \"We are honored to again be recognized by Forbes in its annual list of America's Best Banks. For 2018, we were ranked 11 th , our highest to date and up from 30 th in 2017. We also continue to give back to the communities we serve and call home. Our recently completed Warm Hearts Winter Drive raised over $220,000 and 6,500 winter clothing items for 58 homeless shelters across the Northwest.\" Mr. Robbins continued, \"The success of our Warm Hearts campaign would not have been possible without the tireless efforts of our employees and the generous donations and support we received from clients and community members.\"\nDavid Lawson, Columbia's Executive Vice President and Chief Human Resources Officer, stated, \"We recently announced that Lisa Dow has been appointed Executive Vice President and Chief Risk Officer. We are excited for Lisa to join our executive committee and look forward to leveraging her 35 years of banking experience well into the future.\" Mr. Lawson continued, \"The recent passage of tax reform legislation will allow us to improve the financial position for many of our nonexempt employees as well as enhance our community commitments. We are increasing our minimum wage to $15 per hour, investing additional funds to expand our training programs, and making a contribution to our foundation for employee directed giving.\"\nCash Dividend Announcement\nColumbia will pay a regular cash dividend of $0.22 per common share on February 21, 2018 to shareholders of record as of the close of business on February 7, 2018.\nConference Call Information\nColumbia's management will discuss the fourth quarter and full-year 2017 financial results on a conference call scheduled for Thursday, January 25, 2018 at 1:00 p.m. Pacific Time (4:00 p.m. ET).
