With negotiations due to resume among lawmakers, Trump himself took to Twitter on Saturday to tell his nearly 47 million followers that the Democrats were holding the military hostage because of what he said was their desire for “unchecked illegal immigration.”\n“Can’t let that happen!” Trump tweeted.\nBy early afternoon on Saturday, the top-trending hashtag in the United States was #WomensMarch2018, for the weekend rallies reprising mass protests that marked the beginning of Trump’s presidency. It was followed by a more bipartisan #governmentshutdown2018.\nSome saw the online hashtag duels as a distraction from an avoidable crisis roiling the world’s most powerful government.\n“I hope this debacle ends soon, and with it the annoying shutdown hashtag battle to assess blame,” tweeted David Axelrod, who was senior adviser to former President Barack Obama.\nReporting by Maria Caspani; Editing by Daniel Wallis and Lisa Von Ahn\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-20T21:21:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-20T21:46:24.012+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
