He did not name the institutions.\nThe strengtening of the baht has been driven by a weaker dollar, Thailand’s current account surplus and rising capital inflows, even as they are still at normal levels compared to those in other countries.\nThe baht traded at 31.94 per dollar at 0545 GMT, hovering near a 3-1/2 year high. It has appreicated more than 11 percent against the greenback since the start of 2017.
