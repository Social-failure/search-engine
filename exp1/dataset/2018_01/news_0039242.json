The other man escaped, Panti said. \nAdib said he was a tourist and denied owning the bag during questioning at the justice ministry in Manila on Wednesday, where media were also present. \n“I am innocent of the accusation against me,” he said. “The accusation is not true.” \nBasilan is a no-go area for most Filipinos and Western countries typically warn citizens to stay away, because of the penetration of Abu Sayyaf and fierce military offensives against its fighters. \nAbu Sayyaf is also notorious for making vast sums of money from piracy and kidnapping. Canadians and a German were among the Westerners beheaded by Abu Sayyaf when ransoms were not paid.
