As a result, he estimated that the company had 4 percent market share of U.S. retail holiday spending in 2017. \n\"Considering the U.S. is Amazon's most penetrated market, we see this low-to-mid single digit market share as a significant positive,\" he wrote. \nOlson forecasts Amazon will generate 28 percent sales growth in 2018. \nAmazon shares rose 56 percent in 2017 versus the S&P 500's 19 percent gain. \nThe company's shares were up about 0.40 percent in early Tuesday trading after the report.
