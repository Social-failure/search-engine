He was also accused of killing another youth with a knife during a group fight. His execution is expected at any time. \n“This policy of executions must stop,” Kofler said in a statement. The executions were in direct violation of U.N. conventions on the rights of children and international treaties on civil and political rights signed by Iran, he said. \nGermany remains committed to the 2015 nuclear accord with Iran, but has been outspoken about Iran’s violation of human rights, its support for violence in the region and its continued development of long-range missiles.
