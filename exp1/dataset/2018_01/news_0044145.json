REUTERS/Thomas Peter “I’d also like to see him use his phenomenal speed to get up the court a little bit more and use it more in offense rather than only on defense.”\nTHINKING OF HISTORY Although nicknamed “professor” for his scholarly look, Chung has shown humor on the court, working the crowd with a hand-flapping celebration like many a show-boating NBA player.\nHe also showed himself endearingly human as he blew a 40-0 lead while serving for the match against Sandgren, joining the long list of athletes blinded by visions of the trophy when closing in on victory.\nFive match points came and went before he sealed the win with a thumping forehand to the corner that proved too hot for Sandgren to handle.\n“If I win one more point, I make history in Korea,” Chung said of his wobble.\n“I (was) thinking about the ceremony.”\nChung’s qualification for the semi-finals is certain to trigger a new round of front page headlines in South Korea’s newspapers on Thursday, a country which has hitherto had a very limited tennis history.\nSimilar to Asia’s first grand slam singles champion Li Na, who was overwhelmed by the attention the Chinese woman’s 2011 French Open triumph garnered back home, Chung would need to brace for big change on the domestic front, said Godwin.\n“I don’t think that anyone is ever ready for that kind of thing,” he said.\n”It hits you much bigger than you can imagine.\n“He maybe doesn’t feel the outside effects of it. He will feel it when he gets (home). It will be interesting to see but I think he’ll handle it fine.”\nEditing by John O'Brien\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-01-24T20:08:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-25T13:17:52.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
