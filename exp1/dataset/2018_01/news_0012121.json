A cut in its buying of longer-dated debt earlier this week had fanned worries the BOJ may be moving to turn off its stimulus.\nBATTERED BITCOIN Pedestrians walk past an electronic board displaying the Nikkei average outside a brokerage in Tokyo, Japan January 4, 2018.

Sources in Mexico then said it would also abandon ship if the U.S. did so.\nCommodity markets meanwhile were taking something of a breather after a flying start to the year.\nBoth Brent and U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) oil price futures were hovering just off three-year highs at just under $70 and $64 a barrel, while gold ticked over at $1,320 an ounce after spiking to nearly four-month highs.
