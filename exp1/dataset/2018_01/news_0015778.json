REUTERS/Essam Al-Sudani \nLuaibi, who was speaking at an industry conference in Abu Dhabi, also said that his ministry plans to conclude three contracts with international gas companies by mid-2018 to utilize gas from the south of the country. \nHe said that by 2021, the country plans to “reach zero gas flaring”. \nIraq is forced to flare some of the gas produced alongside crude oil as it lacks the facilities needed to capture and process it into usable fuel.
