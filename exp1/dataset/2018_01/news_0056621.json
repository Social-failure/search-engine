It will be simultaneously broadcast via NFL Network and will be distributed in Spanish on FOX Deportes. \nThe NFL with Fox will decide on a partner to take on the digital rights to live-stream the games, Roger Goodell, NFL Commissioner said on a media call Wednesday morning. \nIn addition, NFL Network will exclusively broadcast seven games next season, with FOX producing the full slate of 18 games. \nBoth the NFL and Fox declined to comment on the financial terms of the deal.
