Zips is the 2 nd largest express car wash chain in the country with 108 stores and will now operate the following locations:\n4906 Main Street, The Colony, TX 75056 100 E.

According to Overman, regarding today's announcement, acquisitions of this size are more and more rare in the express car wash industry. Zips Car Wash was pleased to make the jump over 100 stores with the acquisition of Jett Express Wash.\n\"Zips was the right company to sell to,\" said former President of Jett Express Wash, John Unangst. \"They are so organized and professional, and as I have met more of the team, their awesome personalities confirm for me that Zips is one of the few companies that will work hard to improve on what I've already worked so hard to build,\" he added.\nWith existing stores in San Antonio, Texarkana and surrounding areas, car washing in the Texas climate is no new adventure for the company. However, the dense population and rapid growth of the Dallas-Fort Worth area is an exciting challenge for the Zips team to serve customers both efficiently and with the best car wash in town.\n\"While we have stores in growing cities across the country, we are extremely excited to gain a presence in Dallas-Fort Worth. One of our first duties will be to train the excellent teams we're inheriting from Jett in the Zips Way culture,\" added Harrison Hemphill, COO of Zips Car Wash. \"For us, it's more than just washing cars. Our goal is to train and equip team members for their role in our company, as well as, help them advance in and reach their personal life goals,\" he added.\nZips Car Wash will operate these sites from 8am - 8pm daily and will slowly work to rebrand the stores over the coming months.\nAbout Zips Car Wash Zips Car Wash ( www.zipscarwash.com ), headquartered in Little Rock, AR, operates 108 locations in 11 states, including Arkansas, Oklahoma, Kansas, Texas, Florida, North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia, Mississippi, Louisiana and Tennessee.
