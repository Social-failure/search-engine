At 1156 GMT, shares were up 10.6 percent at 178 crowns each.\n“We’ve already reached our goal by the first half-year so it’s very likely that we will maintain it for this financial year,” said Chief Executive Henrik Clausen.\nB&O Play is close to becoming the largest of Bang & Olufsen’s two product categories.\n“Bang & Olufsen is one business standing on two legs. That one leg is growing faster than the other is completely fine for us,” Clausen told Reuters.\nA TV from the classic Bang & Olufsen line sells at more than $28,000 and speakers can cost nearly $16,000. Products from the B&O Play range are in price from $190 to around $2,700.\nClausen also highlighted the changing nature of the global market for televisions, saying how consumers are using streaming and computers more.\nBang & Olufsen reported earnings before tax of 83 million Danish crowns compared to 37 million crowns in the same quarter last year and above analyst expectations of 67.4 million crowns in a Reuters’ poll.\nThe company raised its forecast for its operating margin for the underlying business to around 3 percent from a previous forecast of 1-3 percent for 2017/18.\nBang & Olufsen’s biggest shareholder is Chinese investor Qi Jianhong, who owns just under 20 percent in the company through his Sparkle Roll companies. In April 2016, Bang & Olufsen rejected a takeover bid by Sparkle Roll.\n($1 = 6.2354 Danish crowns)\nReporting by Julie Astrid Thomsen; editing by Jacob gronholt-Pedersen and Jane Merriman\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-01-11T20:15:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-12T18:43:20.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
