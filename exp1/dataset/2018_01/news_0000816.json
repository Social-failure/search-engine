(NasdaqGS: CPTA) (\"Capitala\") on behalf of all purchasers of Capitala Finance securities between January 4, 2016 and August 7, 2017, for alleged violations of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 by Capitala's officers and directors. Capitala Finance is a management investment company.\nView this information on the law firm's Shareholder Rights Blog: www.robbinsarroyo.com/capitala-finance-corporation\nCapitala Accused of Misleading Investors About the Quality of its Investment Portfolio\nAccording to the complaint, Capitala Investment Advisors, LLC manages Capitala Finance in exchange for an annual base management fee and an incentive fee. On January 4, 2016, Capitala Finance announced that Capitala Investment Advisors agreed to voluntarily waive its quarterly incentive fee. Throughout the class period, Capitala Finance emphasized in its Securities and Exchange Commission filings that the company's success \"depends on the ability of Capitala Investment Advisors to attract and retain qualified personnel in a competitive environment.\" On August 7, 2017, Capitala Finance revealed that six of its investments were on non-accrual status—twice as many as it had the previous quarter. The next day, Capitala Finance revealed that Capitala Investment Advisors had been losing professional talent in underwriting and portfolio management due to the waiving of its incentive fee. Capitala Finance further acknowledged that the rising number of nonaccrual investments was connected to the loss in talent, causing the company’s stock to fall nearly 30% over the next three trading days to close at $8.99 per share on August 10, 2017. Capitala Finance's stock has since fallen even further, closing at $7.28 per share on December 29, 2017.\nCapitala Shareholders Have Legal Options\nIf you would like more information about your rights and potential remedies contact attorney Leonid Kandinov at (800) 350-6003, LKandinov@robbinsarroyo.com , or via the shareholder information form on the firm's website.\nRobbins Arroyo LLP, a nationally recognized leader in shareholder rights law, represents individual and institutional investors in shareholder derivative and securities class action lawsuits, and has helped its clients realize more than $1 billion of value for themselves and the companies in which they have invested.\nAttorney Advertising.
