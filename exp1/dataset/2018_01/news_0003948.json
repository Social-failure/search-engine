As many as 43 people have been sentenced, says the iLaw group that monitors royal insult case, with 92 percent of them pleading guilty in hopes of receiving a shorter jail term. \n“There may be more cases that we do not know about,” Yingcheep Atchanont, iLaw’s project manager, told Reuters. \nThe laws protecting members of the royal family from insult limit what all news organizations, including Reuters, can report from Thailand. \nThe United Nations has expressed concern over what it calls a deteriorating rights situation in Thailand, including harsh sentences for those convicted of violating the lese-majeste law, known as Article 112. \nThe junta has said it needs to crack down on critics of the monarchy for the sake of national security.
