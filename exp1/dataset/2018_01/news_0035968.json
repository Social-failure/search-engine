The United Nations described Myanmar’s crackdown as ethnic cleansing of the Rohingya, which Myanmar denies.\nGrandi said it was important to set in place a monitoring mechanism in Rakhine for those returning and noted the UNHCR currently did not have the ability to move freely and perform this role there.\nMyanmar and Bangladesh agreed earlier this month to complete a voluntary repatriation of the refugees in two years. Myanmar says it had set up two reception centers and a temporary camp near the border in Rakhine to receive the first arrivals.\nRohingya refugees build shelter with bamboo at the Jamtoli camp in the morning in Cox's Bazar, Bangladesh, January 22, 2018. REUTERS/Mohammad Ponir Hossain Human Rights Watch, a non-government organization, said on Tuesday that Bangladesh should suspend the plan entirely as it “threatens the refugees’ security and wellbeing”.\nThe plan has sparked fears in refugee camps in Bangladesh that people may be forced to return despite a lack of guarantees around their security.\n“We are not doing anything hurriedly. We are working hard to ensure their safe, dignified and sustainable return to their homeland. We’ll not send anyone until a conducive environment is created for them,” a Bangladeshi official, who participated in the repatriation talks with Myanmar, told Reuters on Tuesday.\nRohingya refugees walk at Jamtoli camp in the morning in Cox's Bazar, Bangladesh, January 22, 2018. REUTERS/Mohammad Ponir Hossain He said that some 6,000 refugees, who are currently in no man’s land between the two countries, were likely to be the first sent to the camps being set up in Myanmar.\nOfficials in Myanmar said they were ready to begin the repatriation process.\n“We are right now at the border ready to receive, if the Bangladeshis bring them to our side,” Kyaw Tin, Minister of International Cooperation, told reporters in Naypyidaw, Myanmar’s capital.\nRelated Coverage U.S. defense chief says Rohingya plight even worse than media portrayals He said Myanmar was “prepared to receive 300 people a day” to begin with. He said the repatriation would take place five days a week, and then be reviewed after three months to see if it can be accelerated.\nMyanmar’s Social Welfare, Relief and Resettlement Minister Win Myat Aye said the repatriation would take place over the next two years, “or maybe less”.\n“Whoever is eligible, we will accept,” he said.\nAdditional reporting by Stephanie Nebehay in Geneva, Phil Stewart in Jakarta and Ruma Paul in Dhaka; Writing by Euan Rocha; Editing by Nick Macfie\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-23T09:06:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-23T09:23:31.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
