TeleQuality will operate as a stand-alone subsidiary of ENA. The merged companies will have more than 250 employees.\n“This is a new and exciting endeavor for all of us, and we know that coming together will serve to benefit our customers and those who depend on us for connectivity, communications, and cloud services,” said David Pierce, CEO of ENA. “Our shared knowledge, passion, and customer focus will propel us forward and help us grow the needed and essential connectivity services we provide to our customers around the country.”\nBacked by private equity firm, ZMC, ENA is a national market leader in providing transformative connectivity, communication, cloud, and security services to education institutions and libraries that enable student achievement, operational efficiencies, and future capabilities, serving over 5,000 locations. TeleQuality provides similar connectivity and communication services to rural healthcare networks and organizations, serving more than 1,000 locations nationally.\nAccording to the Schools, Health & Libraries Broadband (SHLB) Coalition, 39 percent of rural Americans lack access to 25 Mbps broadband service, the minimum technical parameter of broadband. In contrast, only four percent of urban residents lack equivalent access, creating a vast digital divide among our nation’s citizenry. This merger will enable ENA and TeleQuality to leverage their respective resources and expertise to help address this gap by delivering high-capacity broadband to America’s rural CAIs.\nTim Koxlien, who will retain his title as TeleQuality CEO said of the merger, “Together with ENA, TeleQuality Communications is in a better position to assist our healthcare clients and solve their broadband problems. Bridging the digital divide is critical to delivering top notch quality care in rural areas. This merger will enable us to help our customers deliver the absolute best healthcare they can to the communities they serve, and we could not be more excited about what the future holds.”\nPierce and Koxlien pointed to the merged company’s focus on helping to bridge the digital divide while bringing enhanced services to its customers as a major impetus for the merger.\n“As companies that have both been instrumental in providing connectivity and communication services to CAIs, we share the same goal of making high-quality broadband and related technologies available to as many of them as possible. It’s not just a job for us and our companies, but our joint mission of providing the necessary tools for our customers and their communities to thrive,” they said.\nTerms of the agreement were not disclosed.\nAbout Education Networks of America:\nEducation Networks of America® (ENA) delivers transformative technology solutions supported by exceptional customer care to education and library communities across the nation.
