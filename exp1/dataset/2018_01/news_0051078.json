(NYSE: WDR) today reported fourth quarter 2017 net income 1 of $29.8 million, or $0.36 per diluted share, compared to net income of $53.6 million, or $0.64 per diluted share, during the prior quarter and net income of $29.0 million, or $0.35 per diluted share, during the fourth quarter of 2016.\nSubsequent to the freeze of the pension plan in the third quarter of 2017, we elected in the fourth quarter to change to mark-to-market accounting for the pension plan. The impact from this change in accounting policy has been retrospectively applied to the financial results for all periods presented. These adjustments are non-cash and do not affect our pension liability. Supplemental schedules that include information regarding the prior quarter adjustments have been included with the Current Report on Form 8-K furnished to the SEC today and are also available on the Investor Relations section of our Web site at ir.waddell.com . The impact of the pension expense during the current quarter was $5.9 million ($4.5 million net of taxes) or $0.05 per share.\nThe enactment of the U.S. tax reform required us to revalue our net deferred tax asset, which resulted in a tax charge during the quarter of $5.4 million, or $0.07 per share.\nOperating revenues of $294.5 million during the fourth quarter of 2017 increased 2% sequentially and 1% compared to the fourth quarter of 2016. The operating margin during the current quarter was 18.8% compared to 27.6% during the prior quarter and 16.4% during the same period last year. Pension expense caused most of the sequential variance in our operating margin.\nAs part of our initiative to improve corporate efficiency, we announced a plan last July that is expected to add between $30 and $40 million to pre-tax income by 2019. During 2017, we were able to reduce the run-rate for operating costs by approximately $20 million. In January 2018, we paid off $95 million of Series A senior notes at maturity, which will reduce annual interest costs by approximately $5 million. We have also fully implemented a laddered fixed income investment portfolio to optimize the return on our cash, which we estimate will add up to $5 million per year to investment income depending on the pace of share repurchases and on the cash needs of other corporate initiatives. Offsetting some of our progress to date is the reduction of management fees associated with the previously announced fund mergers. We estimate the impact of reduced management fee revenues to range between $10 and $11 million in 2018. We continue to work toward our cost savings goal and expect to reach our run-rate in 2019.\n1 Net income represents net income attributable to Waddell & Reed Financial, Inc.\nBusiness Discussion\nAssets under management ended the year at $81.1 billion, unchanged compared to the prior quarter and to the prior year end. Sequentially, gross sales declined slightly. Net outflows were $2.7 billion during the quarter, compared to net outflows of $2.8 billion during the prior quarter and net outflows of $4.4 billion during the fourth quarter of 2016. Redemption pressure eased meaningfully over the last 12 months; however, gross sales volume remains subdued, improving only 1% annually compared to the year 2016. As a result of lower redemptions, net outflows improved to $11.4 billion during 2017 compared to net outflows of $25.3 billion during 2016.\n“Over the past year, we have made solid headway in strengthening our investment management capabilities and increasing the competitiveness of our broker-dealer. Despite this progress, work remains to be done to continue to improve our investment performance across our product lineup, advance our broker-dealer initiatives and improve our sales execution in all of our distribution channels,” said Philip J. Sanders, Chief Executive Officer of Waddell & Reed Financial, Inc. “Our team enters 2018 with a new level of energy and focus.”\nFinancial Analysis\nUnder the new pension accounting method, actuarial gains and losses are recognized in the year incurred rather than amortizing them over future periods. The net impact of this change resulted in an increase to net income of $12.7 million, or $0.15 per share, during 2017.\n“The reporting method change for our pension plan will eliminate the timing impact of past actuarial gains and losses from current operating results,” said Brent K. Bloss, Waddell & Reed’s Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. “We are currently implementing a de-risking strategy for the plan’s assets following the freeze of the plan, which should result in less volatility when comparing actual results of the plan assets to actuarial assumptions in the future. Our pension plan remains well funded and this change will have no effect on our employee benefits under the plan.”\nManagement Fee Revenue Analysis\nRevenues increased 2% sequentially due to an increase in average assets under management and a small increase in the effective fee rate. Compared to the same period last year, revenues rose 3% as an increase in the effective fee rate more than offset a small decline in average assets under management.\nDuring the current quarter, the effective management fee rate was 66.5 basis points, compared to 66.1 basis points during the third quarter of 2017 and 64.4 basis points during the fourth quarter of 2016. Average assets under management were $81.3 billion during the current quarter, compared to $80.5 billion and $82.0 billion during the third quarter of 2017 and the fourth quarter of 2016, respectively.\nUnderwriting and Distribution Analysis\nUnderwriting and Distribution Revenues\nRevenues increased 3% sequentially. The increase in revenues was mainly due to higher advisory fees in our broker-dealer, and to a lesser degree, higher sales commissions. Revenues declined slightly compared to the same quarter in 2016, as the increase in advisory fees in our broker-dealer were offset by lower asset-based Rule 12b-1 service and distribution fees in our retail unaffiliated channel.\nUnderwriting and Distribution Costs\nDirect costs increased 1% sequentially due to higher advisory fees in our broker-dealer. Indirect costs increased 21%. Most of the variance is due to a $9.4 million increase in pension expense. The third quarter included a benefit from the valuation associated with the pension plan’s freeze in September, while the current quarter included costs associated with the plan’s re-measurement.\nCompared to the same quarter in 2016, direct costs declined 4% due primarily to the realignment of field management compensation from U&D direct to U&D indirect in our broker-dealer. Indirect costs declined 6% due to a combination of lower wholesaler compensation and IT support. The increase in compensation associated with the field realignment in our broker-dealer was more than offset by lower sales and support costs for this channel.\nCompensation and Related Expense Analysis\nCosts increased 78% sequentially. Most of the variance is due to a $21.3 million increase in pension expenses. The third quarter included a benefit from the valuation associated with the pension plan’s freeze in September, while the current quarter included costs associated with the plan’s re-measurement. Higher incentive compensation, benefits and share-based compensation contributed approximately $2 million in aggregate to the sequential increase in costs. Compared to the same quarter in 2016, costs rose 5% due to higher share-based compensation.\nGeneral and Administrative Expense Analysis\nCosts decreased 14% sequentially due to a combination of lower legal and consulting costs and reduced usage of temporary office staff. Compared to the same period in 2016, costs increased 7%. The year over year increase in cost was due to higher IT costs and additional use of temporary staff.\nIncome Tax Expense Analysis\nThe effective tax rate for the quarter was elevated due to a revaluation of our net deferred tax asset and other tax adjustments resulting from the enactment of U.S. tax reform of $5.4 million, or $0.07 per share, as well as a tax shortfall on restricted stock vesting in the quarter of $1.8 million, or $0.02 per share.\nWe estimate a tax run rate for 2018 to be in the range of 23% to 25%, though the actual effective tax rate may differ due to nonrecurring or discrete items and issuance of additional guidance on, or changes to our analysis of, recent tax reform legislation.\nInvestment Management Performance\nStarting in June 2017, we began using I shares in our rankings. This change was made to use a consistent share class that aligns with the industry’s sales and asset concentrations. Performance in prior periods utilized each funds’ older share class, which was generally the A shares.\nFund Rankings 1 Year 3 Years 5 Years Lipper Funds ranked in top half 32 % 38 % 46 % Assets ranked in top half 36 % 41 % 50 % MorningStar Funds ranked in top half 35 % 28 % 45 % Assets ranked in top half 42 % 29 % 49 % MorningStar Ratings Overall 3 Years 5 Years Funds with 4/5 stars 28 % 11 % 28 % Assets with 4/5 stars 38 % 11 % 38 % Asset Manager ($ in millions) Three Months Ended Mar. 31, Jun. 30, Sep. 30, Dec. 31 Mar. 31, Jun. 30, Sep. 30, Dec. 31 2016 2017 Retail Unaffiliated Distribution Beginning assets $ 45,641 $ 38,623 $ 35,197 $ 33,290 $ 30,295 $ 30,182 $ 30,307 $ 31,062 Sales 1 2,144 1,526 1,320 1,373 1,799 2,080 1,790 1,577 Redemptions (7,680 ) (5,543 ) (4,824 ) (4,390 ) (3,707 ) (2,886 ) (2,486 ) (2,912 ) Net exchanges 158 127 161 11 236 235 213 316 Net Flows (5,378 ) (3,890 ) (3,343 ) (3,006 ) (1,672 ) (571 ) (483 ) (1,019 ) Market action (1,640 ) 464 1,436 11 1,559 696 1,238 1,090 Ending assets $ 38,623 $ 35,197 $ 33,290 $ 30,295 $ 30,182 $ 30,307 $ 31,062 $ 31,133 Organic growth\n(47.1 ) % (40.3 ) % (38.0 ) % (36.1 ) % (22.1 ) % (7.6 ) % (6.4 ) % (13.1 ) % Redemption rate\n77.7 % 61.3 % 56.2 % 56.7 % 50.5 % 39.2 % 33.0 % 37.9 % Retail Broker-Dealer Beginning assets $ 43,344 $ 42,142 $ 42,261 $ 43,170 $ 42,322 $ 43,110 $ 43,084 $ 43,472 Sales 1 1,068 1,094 1,024 1,101 978 1,142 1,024 1,077 Redemptions (1,197 ) (1,329 ) (1,542 ) (1,669 ) (1,871 ) (1,812 ) (2,049 ) (2,026 ) Net exchanges (172 ) (163 ) (194 ) (182 ) (236 ) (241 ) (213 ) (316 ) Net Flows (301 ) (398 ) (712 ) (750 ) (1,129 ) (911 ) (1,238 ) (1,265 ) Market action (901 ) 517 1,621 (98 ) 1,917 885 1,626 1,453 Ending assets $ 42,142 $ 42,261 $ 43,170 $ 42,322 $ 43,110 $ 43,084 $ 43,472 $ 43,660 Organic growth\n(2.8 ) % (3.8 ) % (6.7 ) % (6.9 ) % (10.7 ) % (8.5 ) % (11.5 ) % (11.6 ) % Redemption rate\n9.3 % 10.5 % 12.1 % 12.5 % 15.1 % 14.7 % 16.4 % 16.1 % Institutional Beginning assets $ 15,414 $ 14,426 $ 8,993 $ 8,595 $ 7,904 $ 7,792 $ 7,036 $ 6,365 Sales 1 453 190 180 242 142 78 68 66 Redemptions (1,068 ) (5,699 ) (1,051 ) (1,042 ) (727 ) (1,057 ) (1,139 ) (521 ) Net exchanges 14 36 33 171 - 6 - - Net Flows (601 ) (5,473 ) (838 ) (629 ) (585 ) (973 ) (1,071 ) (455 ) Market action (387 ) 40 440 (62 ) 473 217 400 379 Ending assets $ 14,426 $ 8,993 $ 8,595 $ 7,904 $ 7,792 $ 7,036 $ 6,365 $ 6,289 Organic growth\n(15.6 ) % (151.8 ) % (37.3 ) % (29.3 ) % (29.6 ) % (49.9 ) % (60.9 ) % (28.6 ) % Redemption rate\n29.9 % 198.9 % 46.4 % 51.3 % 37.2 % 58.7 % 67.3 % 32.2 % Consolidated Total Beginning assets $ 104,399 $ 95,191 $ 86,451 $ 85,055 $ 80,521 $ 81,084 $ 80,427 $ 80,899 Sales 1 3,665 2,810 2,524 2,716 2,919 3,300 2,882 2,720 Redemptions (9,945 ) (12,571 ) (7,417 ) (7,101 ) (6,305 ) (5,755 ) (5,674 ) (5,459 ) Net exchanges - - - - - - - - Net Flows (6,280 ) (9,761 ) (4,893 ) (4,385 ) (3,386 ) (2,455 ) (2,792 ) (2,739 ) Market action (2,928 ) 1,021 3,497 (149 ) 3,949 1,798 3,264 2,922 Ending assets $ 95,191 $ 86,451 $ 85,055 $ 80,521 $ 81,084 $ 80,427 $ 80,899 $ 81,082 Organic growth\n(24.1 ) % (41.0 ) % (22.6 ) % (20.6 ) % (16.8 ) % (12.1 ) % (13.9 ) % (13.5 ) % Redemption rate\n41.3 % 55.6 % 33.3 % 33.3 % 30.5 % 27.9 % 27.1 % 25.7 % 1 Sales is primarily gross sales (net of sales commissions).
