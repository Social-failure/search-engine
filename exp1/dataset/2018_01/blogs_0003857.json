He said he wanted to get rid of the levy altogether, but that his government needed the revenue raised by the tax in order to reduce Argentina's wide fiscal deficit. \nThe government is also cutting the export tax on soyoil and soymeal, down as of this month to 26.5 percent from a previous 27 percent. Under the plan, the levy on soy derivatives is due to fall to 15 percent by 2020, the ministry's statement said. \nArgentina is the world's top exporter of soymeal livestock feed and its third biggest supplier of raw soybeans. \n(Reporting by Maximilian Heath and Hugh Bronstein, Editing by Rosalba O'Brien)", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-03T00:22:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-03T01:08:56.034+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
