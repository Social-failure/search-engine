I don’t think she’s ever cared about what people think, which is what has made her a great champion. \n“She is out there to win tennis matches and I think she said it all at the U.S. Open, you can put her on any court and all she wants to do is win.” \nWith reigning champion Williams yet to return from maternity leave, her sister Venus eliminated in round one and twice champion Victoria Azarenka also absent, Sharapova will be eyeing a strong run and Wilander thinks she should be welcomed back. \n“She has paid her dues,” he said. “She was suspended for a while, now she’s back and I‘m sure people will be in their seats to watch her come back.” \nHowever, the former world number one faces a tough path if she is to claim a sixth grand slam title against the odds. \nShe could meet 14th seed Anastasija Sevastova in the second round, with 2016 champion Angelique Kerber a possible last 32 opponent and Wimbledon champion Garbine Muguruza a potential fourth round rival should she get that far.
