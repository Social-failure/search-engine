The zoo released the first pictures of the animal in recent days.\nOkapis are members of the giraffe family - though they do not have the long neck. Native to the Democratic Republic of Congo, they are notable for zebra-like stripes on their hind quarters and upper legs.\n“We’re very pleased with how mother and baby are doing. Oni is being very attentive, making sure she regularly licks her clean and keeping a watchful eye over Meghan as she sleeps,” zookeeper Gemma Metcalf said in a statement.\nOkapis are listed as an endangered species on the International Union for Conservation of Nature’s Red List. Researchers cited by the San Diego Zoo estimate that around 25,000 Okapis remain in the wild.\nMarkle is due to wed Prince Harry, fifth in line to the British throne, in May of 2018.\n(This corrected version of the story fixes the date Okapi was born, adds line saying when first pictures released).\nWriting by Mark Hanrahan in London; Editing by Richard Balmforth\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-17T15:41:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-17T16:12:23.023+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
