It had been handed over to the civil affairs bureau. \nConcerns were growing that the tanker may explode and sink while a flotilla of 13 search and rescue vessels comb a 900-square-nautical-mile (3,100 sq km) area around the ship for the crew. The tanker hit a freight ship on Saturday night in the East China Sea, burst into flames and has been spilling oil. \nThe tanker Sanchi (IMO:9356608), run by Iran’s top oil shipping operator, National Iranian Tanker Co, collided with the CF Crystal (IMO:9497050), carrying grain from the United States, about 160 nautical miles (300 km) off China’s coast near Shanghai and the mouth of the Yangtze River Delta. \nThe Sanchi was carrying 136,000 tonnes of condensate, an ultra-light crude oil that becomes highly volatile when exposed to air and water, to South Korea. \nThe size of the oil spill from the ship and the extent of the environmental harm were not known, but the disaster has the potential to be the worst since 1991 when 260,000 tonnes of oil leaked off the Angolan coast.

The cargo is still on fire, so it is hard to figure out if oil is being spilled,” Park Sung-dong, an official from South Korea’s Ministry of Oceans and Fisheries, told Reuters. \nChinese state media CCTV showed footage on Monday of boats dousing the flames with water as plumes of thick dark smoke continued to billow from the tanker. \nThe crew of the Sanchi are all Iranian nationals except for two Bangladeshi citizens. The CF Crystal suffered limited damage and the 21 crew members, all Chinese nationals, were rescued. \nThe freighter has been taken to a port near Shanghai where investigators will start work on assessing the cause of the disaster. \nChina’s transport ministry warned that toxic gas from the tanker was harmful to the rescue workers and that protective clothing and gas testing equipment was being dispatched to the emergency teams. \nWhen condensate meets water, it evaporates quickly and can cause a large-scale explosion as it reacts with air and turns into a flammable gas, the ministry said on Monday. \nTrying to contain a spill of condensate, which is extremely low in density, highly toxic and much more explosive than normal crude oil, may be difficult. \n(For a graphic on ship collision off China's coast click tmsnrt.rs/2CBgqai ) Reporting by Josephine Mason and Beijing News Monitoring in BEIJING; Jane Chung and Yuna Park in SEOUL; Editing by Christian Schmollinger", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-09T10:44:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-09T10:52:14.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
