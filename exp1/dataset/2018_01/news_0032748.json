The hire, the company’s first human resources lead, comes as the company accelerates worldwide growth in revenue and staff.\nFenzl has more than 15 years of experience guiding and developing the performance of customer-driven organizations. She arrives from Moat, where as the first HR head, she supported more than 350 employees in the US and overseas, guiding the company up to and through acquisition by Oracle in April 2017. Fenzl previously built HR teams at Nintex, Hitwise (acquired by Experian) and Paradise Bakery & Café (acquired by Panera Bread).\n“Our mission is to align B2B sales and marketing with knowledge about which customers are most likely to engage,” said Erik Matlick, founder and CEO of Bombora. “Creating and helping customers and partners understand our intent data requires not only sophistication, but also selflessness, as we look to put others first in order to achieve outcomes. Susan’s track record shows that she knows how to help ensure this process, and we’re excited to have her join us.”\nBombora is primed for another year of growth in 2018 in terms of both hiring and expansion of its presence throughout the B2B sales and marketing ecosystem. Along with Fenzl, Bombora has added senior sales talent to its West Coast presence with Al Gerona (formerly of Oracle Marketing Cloud, Fliptop/Linked and Salesforce), Bob Lewis (Cision, Oracle, LinkedIn and Infogroup) and Brendan Balan (6sense, LinkedIn, Kontera and Buzzlogic) all joining in enterprise sales roles in Bombora’s San Francisco office.\nAbout Bombora\nBombora is the leading provider of Intent data for B2B marketers.
