He has completed his strategic task: he has a nuclear weapon, he has missiles of global reach, up to 13,000 km, which can reach almost any point of the globe,” Putin told Russian journalists at a televised meeting.\nRussia has voted at the United Nations in favor of international sanctions against North Korea over its nuclear program, while urging the West to show restraint and calling for talks over the issue.\nPutin reiterated that dialogue with North Korea was warranted, and said Kim now wanted to calm the situation.\n“He is already a shrewd and mature politician,” Putin said.\nNorth Korea and South Korea held talks on Tuesday after a prolonged period of tension on the Korean peninsula over the North’s missile and nuclear programs.\nReporting by Vladimir Soldatkin and Christian Lowe; Writing by Andrew Osborn; Editing by Peter Graff\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-01-12T01:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-11T21:52:02.009+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
