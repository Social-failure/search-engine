That beat analyst estimates of $319 million, according to brokerage Cowen & Co., and well outpaced expectations from the beginning of 2017. Growth was strongest for the drug outside the United States.\nShares of the Cambridge, Massachusetts-based company rose 2.3 percent to $354.32 in late morning trading.\nThe list price for Spinraza is a whopping $750,000 for the first year of therapy, dropping to about $375,000 a year after that. It is a potential blockbuster for Biogen, but does face possible competition as smaller gene therapy company Avexis Inc ( AVXS.O ) is developing an SMA treatment.\nQUARTERLY LOSS Biogen recorded a fourth-quarter loss compared with a year-ago profit, as it recorded a $1.57 billion charge due to the U.S. tax code overhaul.\nDespite increasing competition for its key multiple sclerosis drugs, Biogen forecast 2018 adjusted earnings per share between $24.20 and $25.20, above consensus estimates of $24.16,\nRevenue for 2018 is expected to be in the range of $12.7 billion to $13 billion. Analysts on average expect $12.7 billion.\nExecutives on the company’s conference call noted that through cash and leverage, Biogen has access to up to $37 billion for deals and other capital expenditure.\nThat “gives us a lot of capacity to add to the business and I think our focus is on that -- on growing the business, continuing to be active in early stage, but also hopefully being active in mid- to late-stage assets to bring in things that are closer to revenue,” Chief Financial Officer Jeffrey Capello said.\nIts net loss was $297.4 million, or $1.40 per share, on revenue of $3.31 billion in the quarter. That compares with a profit of $649.2 million, or $2.99 per share, a year earlier.\nExcluding items, it earned $5.26 per share. On average, analysts were expecting $5.45 per share on revenue of $3.08 billion,\nReporting by Michael Erman in New York and Tamara Mathias in Bengaluru; Editing by Arun Koyyur and Bernadette ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-01-25T19:46:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-25T14:01:52.011+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
