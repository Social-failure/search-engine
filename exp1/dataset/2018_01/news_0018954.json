The common currency extended its gains on hopes that European Central Bank policymakers are preparing to reduce their vast monetary stimulus program.\nThe euro was up 0.9 percent to $1.2139, on pace for its biggest single-day percentage gain against the greenback in about two months.\nThe euro’s rise weighed on the dollar index, which measures the greenback against six rival currencies. The index was down 0.59 percent at 91.313, after slipping to a four-month low of 91.243.\nThe index pared losses slightly after the release of the U.S. consumer price data.\nOn Wall Street, bank shares rose following quarterly results from JPMorgan Chase & Co and Wells Fargo. While tax-related costs are expected to weigh on banks’ earnings, they are expected to benefit in the long run from a lower tax burden.\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 202.12 points, or 0.79 percent, to 25,776.85, the S&P 500 gained 13.61 points, or 0.49 percent, to 2,781.17 and the Nasdaq Composite added 40.44 points, or 0.56 percent, to 7,252.21.\nThe pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index rose 0.17 percent and MSCI’s gauge of stocks across the globe gained 0.56 percent.\nU.S. stock indexes hit all-time highs, along with the MSCI world index.\nThe MSCI index has already surged 3.8 percent since the start of the year.\nIn commodities, oil prices retreated from 2014 highs hit the previous day, but they remained on track for a fourth week of gains.\nU.S. crude fell 0.22 percent to $63.66 per barrel and Brent was last at $69.15, down 0.16 percent on the day.\nInvestors warned that while rising oil prices were supportive, they could weigh negatively especially on crude-consuming regions.\nFor the Reuters Live Markets blog on European and UK stock markets, open a news window on Reuters Eikon by pressing F9 and type in ‘Live Markets’ in the search bar\nAdditional reporting by Marc Jones in Helen Reid in London and Kate Duguid in New York; Editing by Bernadette Baum\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-01-13T01:02:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-13T06:53:15.001+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
