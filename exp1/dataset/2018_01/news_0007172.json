This rule defies the will of a bipartisan majority of Americans and fails to preserve a free and open internet,\" the Internet Association said in a statement.\nThe new rules give internet service providers sweeping powers to change how consumers access the internet but must have new transparency requirements that will require them to disclose any changes to consumers.\nInternet Association members also include Airbnb, Etsy Inc, Amazon.com and several dozen online and social media companies.
