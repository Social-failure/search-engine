The remaining seven economists expect the central bank to end it sometime next year.\nBut over 60 percent of the poll’s participants who answered another question said the ECB should pull the plug on its 30 billion euros worth of monthly asset purchases by the end of September at the latest. That included almost a fifth of the economists who said it should happen well before September.\n“There is no need to extend QE beyond September 2018 given that growth will remain clearly above potential for the time being and that there are increasing signs that underlying inflation will trend higher,” said Martin Wolburg, senior economist at Generali Investments.\n“Prolonging QE in this environment would do more harm than good.”\nEURO RISING ON SOLID GROWTH, NOT INFLATION The euro zone economy is forecast to grow on average 2.2 percent this year and 1.8 percent next, compared to 2.1 percent and 1.8 percent, respectively, in the previous poll.\nSurging business and consumer confidence and steady job creation have left economists repeatedly raising their estimates for major economies in the region.\nThe German economy, Europe’s largest, is expected to continue its solid upswing, with GDP growth forecast at 2.4 percent for 2018, compared to 1.9 percent in the previous poll.\nEconomists were increasingly bullish about France’s economic outlook forecasting on average 2.0 percent growth this year, up from 1.7 percent in a poll in October.\nBut the ECB is expected to keep its interest rates on hold this year. The central bank is forecast to have raised its refinancing rate by 25 basis points to 0.25 percent and deposit rates by 40 basis points to zero percent by the end of 2019.\nThe ECB is expected to take its deposit rates higher for the first time since 2011 in the second quarter of 2019.\nThose expectations come on the back of solid growth for the euro zone economy in 2017, during which it surpassed that of the U.S. and Britain.\nThe strength of the bloc’s economy has driven the euro’s best run since 2003 last year and a separate Reuters poll showed the single currency was expected to trade slightly higher by end-2018. [EUR/POLL]\nEuro strength will be one of the challenges the central bank needs to deal with as a stronger currency tends to dampen inflation by making exports dearer and imports cheaper.\nSince the ECB’s last meeting, the single currency has gained over 4 percent and policymakers need to evaluate the impact of this rise on prices and the economy.\nIndeed, the euro zone economy expanding at its fastest pace in a decade and jobless rate at nine-year lows has not converted into significantly faster price growth.\nInflation is not expected to reach the ECB’s target until 2020 at least, with the consensus ranging between 1.3 and 1.6 percent in each quarter through to the middle of next year.\nFor the full year, inflation is forecast to average 1.5 percent this year and 1.6 percent next.\nThe risk, though, is skewed more to the upside for inflation as the latest expectations were higher compared to the previous poll and the range of forecasts show pessimism has dissipated.\n“In the context of an upwardly revised growth path, 2018 will likely mark the beginning of three key shifts – from negative to positive output gap, from below- to above-average core inflation and from ECB QE to the end of it,” noted Daniele Antonucci, ‎senior European economist at Morgan Stanley.\n(For other stories from the Reuters global long-term economic outlook polls package see)\nPolling and additional reporting by Indradip Ghosh and Manjul Paul in Bengaluru, Michael Nienaber in Berlin, Leigh Thomas in Paris and Viviana Venturi in Milan; Editing by Toby Chopra\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-01-19T23:05:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-20T02:54:37.013+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
