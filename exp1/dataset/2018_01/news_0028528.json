Previously, Russia was supplying raw sunflower oil to Turkey, which was then selling refined oil to Syria, he said. \n“Now, we are entering these countries directly,” Khotko said, adding that Russia has also boosted direct supplies of sunflower oil to Iraq this marketing year, which started on September 1. \nSolnechnye Produkty has already exported its sunflower oil to eleven countries, including Iraq, Iran and Turkey, so far this season and plans to develop its supplies to the Middle East, the company said in a statement.
