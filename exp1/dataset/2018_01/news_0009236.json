The probe excludes aluminum used in beverage can manufacturing.\nThe unanimous vote was applauded by the Aluminum Association, which represents U.S. aluminum producers and worked with Commerce on the probe.\n“U.S. companies that make common alloy aluminum sheet have suffered extensive injury thanks to unfairly traded imports from China for many years,” the group’s president, Heidi Brock, said in a statement.\nBut the National Marine Manufacturers Association said the decision was bad news for aluminum boat makers, a big part of a $3 billion recreational boating industry that claims to support 650,000 U.S. jobs.\n“The ruling is expected to significantly drive up the costs of aluminum used to manufacture more than 111,000 boats such as pontoons and fishing boats, which make up 43 percent of new powerboat sales,” NMMA President Thom Dammrich said in a statement.\nEarlier this week, U.S. aluminum products makers sought new protections against Chinese aluminum shipped through Vietnam, asking Commerce to investigate allegations that China Zhongwang Holdings Ltd ( 1333.HK ) is circumventing U.S. duties.\nAnd next week, the Commerce Department is due to send the White House the results of its investigation into whether rising aluminum imports are threatening U.S. national security, a probe likely to provide U.S. President Donald Trump with an opportunity to levy broad tariffs or import quotas on aluminum.\nThe results of a similar “Section 232” national security probe into steel imports was given to Trump on Thursday night. Commerce did not reveal its recommendations.\nChina’s excess production capacity for both steel and aluminum has emerged as a major trade irritant for the United States and Europe, prompting them to consider new steps to protect domestic industries and jobs from a flood of Chinese imports.\nReporting by David Lawder, Tim Ahmann, and Eric Walsh; Editing by Susan Heavey, Tom Brown and Chris Reese\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-01-13T00:44:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-13T06:50:07.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
