The issue has poisoned French politics for decades and spawned a hardcore eco-protest movement that threatened widespread disruption over the issue. \nFrench construction giant Vinci had won the contract to build the new airport, near the city of Nantes. It also operates the existing airport in the city, which Philippe said will be modernised.
