Debenhams’s 2021s are trading around 96, according to Tradeweb data. \nNew Look and House of Fraser carry distressed ratings, at Caa2/CCC+ and Caa1/B-, respectively, while Debenhams is now rated B1/BB-. NEAR THE END? \nWith New Look plummeting further into distressed territory and the threat to its supply chain and cashflows, questions arise as to how much longer the company can steer through its troubles. \nThe loss of these protections have had disastrous consequences for retailers historically, leading to the insolvency of Woolworth, for example. \nUK news reports also said that, in addition to New Look’s poor financial results, credit insurers have also been spooked by South African retailer Steinhoff’s accounting scandal. Steinhoff’s biggest shareholder, Christo Wiese, is also the largest stakeholder in Brait, which owns New Look. \nWhile one investor called the developments the “end of the game” for New Look, another stressed that it all came down to the company’s liquidity position. \nThe company has £208.4m available in cash and liquidity facilities, £100m of which is an undrawn revolving credit facility, according to an investor presentation for its results for the 26 weeks ending on September 23. \nNew Look will need to pay around £76m-equivalent in coupon payments on its three outstanding bonds in May, according to Thomson Reuters data. \n“The revolving credit facility has clearly gotten them through the Christmas season, so the important thing is how they’ve ended Christmas and whether they’ve still got access to the revolving credit facility and how much cash they have on balance sheet,” the second investor said. \nNew Look is expected to release its next quarterly results in early February. \n“We have the liquidity and operating facilities to implement our plans - and we have the time to recover,” the company had told investors in the presentation, adding that Brait remains committed to being a long-term shareholder. \nNew Look declined to comment on it latest supply chain troubles. STERLING PIPELINE? \nOne syndicate banker said volatility around the names could have impacts on sentiment around anticipated high-yield bond deals for UK consumer names, such as Pure Gym and Matalan. \n“I think the UK is a bit different - the retailers that have issued bonds recently have been more from continental Europe who will get bailed out by growth in Europe,” the banker said. \nBut, with other retailers such as Poundland, Next and John Lewis releasing strong results last week, a case-by-case evaluation of UK consumer names is likely to continue, as in 2017.
