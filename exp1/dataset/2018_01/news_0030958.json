This has become even more urgent given Trump’s threat to scrap the North American Free Trade Agreement.\nReporting by Diego Ore; Editing by Richard Borsuk\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-01-18T11:48:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-18T12:24:08.005+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
