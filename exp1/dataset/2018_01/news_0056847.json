The Bruins were approaching their franchise-best points streak of 23 straight games (15-0-8) in the 1940-41 season.\nJohn Gibson stopped all 25 shots he faced in net for the Ducks, but departed with 7:25 remaining in the game after being shaken up on a shot from Boston’s Patrice Bergeron earlier in the period. He was replaced by Ryan Miller, who finished with five saves.\nRyan Spooner netted a goal, on his 26th birthday, and Anton Khudobin stopped 24 of 26 shots in between the pipes for Boston.\nBoston’s David Backes also exited the game late in the third period after taking a hit from Nick Ritchie.\nSilfverberg opened the scoring with his 12th goal of the season with 10:56 left in the first period, getting a lucky bounce off his skate to allow the puck to sneak past Khudobin after Cam Fowler’s backhanded effort.\nHenrique’s first goal, his 14th of the campaign, came on a power play with 6:01 to go in the opening period after he fired a shot from the face-off circle past Khudobin’s stick-side blocker, making it 2-0.\nSpooner made things interesting with his eight goal of the season with 42 seconds to play, but an empty-netter by Henrique with seven ticks to play ended any hope of a miracle Boston comeback.\nThe Bruins had won eight straight when allowing the first goal before Tuesday’s game.\nBoston was again without All-Star Brad Marchand, who was serving the second game of his five-game suspension for an elbow to the head of New Jersey’s Marcus Johansson a week ago Tuesday.\nBoston plays the second of three games at home Thursday against St. Louis. Anaheim continues its five-game road trip Thursday in Ottawa.\n--Field Level Media\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-01-31T11:11:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-31T16:40:12.025+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
