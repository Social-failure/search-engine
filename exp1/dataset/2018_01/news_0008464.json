Beauty, visit the Company’s website at http://www.elfcosmetics.com .\nNote Regarding Non-GAAP Financial Measures\nThis press release includes references to Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted Pro Forma Diluted EPS. The Company presents these measures because its management uses these as supplemental measures in assessing its operating performance, and believes they are helpful to investors, securities analysts and other interested parties in evaluating the Company’s performance. The measures referenced above are not measurements of financial performance under GAAP and they should not be considered as alternatives to measures of performance derived in accordance with GAAP. In addition, these alternative measures should not be construed as an inference that the Company’s future results will be unaffected by unusual or non-recurring items. These alternative measures have limitations as analytical tools, and you should not consider such measures either in isolation or as substitutes for analyzing the Company’s results as reported under GAAP. The Company’s definitions and calculations of these alternative measures are not necessarily comparable to other similarly titled measures used by other companies due to different methods of calculation. Adjusted EBITDA (earnings before interest expense, income tax, depreciation and amortization) excludes costs related to “restructuring” of operations, initial public offering costs, stock-based compensation, management fees paid to our sponsor, retail store pre-opening costs, customer expansion costs, other non-cash and non-recurring costs and (gains)/losses on foreign currency contracts. Adjusted Net Income excludes costs related to “restructuring” of operations, initial public offering costs, stock-based compensation, management fees paid to our sponsor, retail store pre-opening costs, customer expansion costs, other non-cash and non-recurring costs, (gains)/losses on foreign currency contracts, interest expense and the tax impact of the foregoing adjustments. Adjusted Pro Forma Diluted EPS equals Adjusted Net Income divided by fully-diluted pro forma share count, which reflects the number of shares issued with the initial public offering in September 2016 as if they had been outstanding as of January 1, 2016. With respect to the Company’s expectations under “Fiscal 2017 Outlook” above, the Company is not able to provide a quantitative reconciliation of the Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted Pro Forma Diluted EPS guidance non-GAAP measures to the corresponding Net Income and Diluted EPS GAAP measures without unreasonable efforts. The Company cannot provide meaningful estimates of the non-recurring charges and credits excluded from these non-GAAP measures at this time because it has not yet completed its year-end close. For the same reasons, the Company is unable to address the probable significance of the unavailable information.\nForward-Looking Statements\nThis press release contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. Forward-looking statements discuss the Company’s current expectations, estimates and projections relating to its financial condition and results of operations.
