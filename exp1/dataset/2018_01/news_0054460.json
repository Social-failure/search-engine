We had more moments than three goals, but Huddersfield defended well.” \nThe home side had the first opportunity when Belgian striker Laurent Depoitre’s side-foot effort was saved by Loris Karius in the 17th minute after Chris Loewe had broken down the left and delivered a fine cross.

It was a difficult night when all the details went against us.” Reporting by Simon Evans; Editing by Ken Ferris", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-31T00:26:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-31T00:50:34.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
