Maduro says such contraband is driving chronic product shortages, while his critics insist the country’s state-led economic model is to blame.\nReporting by Umpi Welvaart in Willemstad, Mircely Guanipa in Punto Fijo, Venezuela, and Sailu Urribarri in Jacksonville, editing by Brian Ellsworth and Grant McCool\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-11T04:22:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-11T04:31:39.034+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
