The company did not disclose how much. \n\"Overall, we believe the Tax Act will be a positive development for both the U.S. economy and American Express,\" American Express said. \nThe announcement coincided with the company's fourth quarter earnings report. American Express beat Wall Street expectations on earnings and revenue, although stock tumbled about 2 percent in extended trading. \nThis story is developing. Please check back for updates.
