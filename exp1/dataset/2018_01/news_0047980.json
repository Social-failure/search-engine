I don’t think that’s the way to do business,” Enders said in a telephone interview. \nA U.S. agency earlier rejected imposing duties on Bombardier’s CSeries, dismissing Boeing Co’s claim that it had been harmed by the sale of the jet at low prices to Delta Air Lines. Bombardier is in the process of selling the CSeries programme to Airbus, which plans to assemble some jets at its Alabama plant.
