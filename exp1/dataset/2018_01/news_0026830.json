Terms of the possible deal couldn’t be learned. Juno JUNO, +49.74% had a market value of about $5.5 billion as of Tuesday afternoon. \nA deal would come on the heels of Celgene’s CELG, -1.28% agreement just over a week ago to buy closely held Impact Biomedicines. Celgene is to pay $1.1 billion upfront and could make billions of dollars of additional payments if Impact hits certain milestones. \nCelgene, based in Summit, N.J., is one of the biggest U.S. biotech companies. It’s known for its blood-cancer drugs, notably top-selling product Revlimid, but has been trying to diversify its portfolio before Revlimid loses patent protection in the U.S.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-17T00:18:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-17T03:00:53.004+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
