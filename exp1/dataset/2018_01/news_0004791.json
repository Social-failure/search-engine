Reuters was not able to immediately reach the ministry.\nEarlier on Wednesday, the ministry said a Mi-24 helicopter had crash-landed in Syria on Dec. 31 due to a technical fault and two pilots died.\nLast month, Russia began establishing a permanent presence at Hmeymim and a naval base at Tartous although President Vladimir Putin has ordered a “significant” withdrawal of his military from Syria, declaring their work largely done.\nReporting by Vladimir Soldatkin; Editing by Robin Pomeroy\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-03T23:53:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-04T00:13:30.009+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
