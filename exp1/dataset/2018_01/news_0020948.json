VTech didn’t admit to any violations of law as part of the settlement.\nThe FTC began investigating VTech after the company disclosed a November 2015 data breach in which a hacker gained access to five million customer accounts. \nThe data included more than 600,000 children’s accounts, many of which included photos and were linked to the physical addresses, according to Jacqueline Connor, a lawyer with the FTC.\nRelated \nTalking Dolls May Spread Children’s Secrets, Privacy Groups Allege VTech Holdings said five million accounts, which included children’s birthdays and photos, were illegally accessed.

In recent years, a large number of security and privacy issues have been discovered in cheap internet-connected devices and appliances. Last year, another toy maker, CloudPets, said its user data may have been accessed by a third party.\nIn a statement, VTech said it has updated its security practices and has taken steps “to address the technical notice and consent issues under COPPA.”\nWrite to Robert McMillan at Robert.Mcmillan@wsj.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-09T00:08:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-09T09:58:47.023+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
