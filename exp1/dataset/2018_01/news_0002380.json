These principles can be applied to services trade too.”\nLast month, Barnier said he was not aware of any free-trade deal the EU had concluded which included unfettered access for financial services.\nReporting by Alistair Smout; editing by Guy Faulconbridge\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-02T09:51:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-02T10:07:11.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
