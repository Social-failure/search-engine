Wichita State saw 11 players hit the court, and 10 of them scored at least four points.\nWichita State outshot UCF 43.5 percent-36.1 percent, owned a 48-38 edge in rebounding, and a 21-5 advantage in second-chance points. The Shockers’ bench players outscored their UCF counterparts 50-22.\nDayon Griffin led UCF (13-7, 4-4) with 15 points but shot just 5 of 13 in the loss. BJ Taylor added 12 points for the Knights, who lost for the third time in four games after beginning the league season with three wins.\nWichita State made the game’s first basket 1:07 into the game and never trailed, pulling away to lead 36-20 on a 3-pointer by Morris with 2:37 remaining in the half. But then the Shockers went cold from the floor, missing their last 10 field goals attempts of the half. That allowed UCF to forge an 11-3 run that pulled it to within 39-31 at halftime.\nMorris led the Shockers with nine points in the half while UCF’s Griffin paced all scorers with 10 points.\nThe Knights cut the lead to 42-35 on a layup by Brown with 18:31 to play but the rest of the game belonged to Wichita State.\nNext up for Shockers is a game Sunday at home against Tulsa. UCF is off until Wednesday, when it hosts Connecticut.\n--Field Level Media\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-01-26T12:37:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-26T21:37:30.010+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
