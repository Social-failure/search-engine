The ECB is conducting verbal tightening, so they don’t need to move on interest rates.”\nAgainst the yen, the dollar slipped to its lowest levels since mid-September, as comments from Japan’s central bank governor underscored Japan’s economic recovery.\nWhile Bank of Japan Governor Haruhiko Kuroda reiterated the central bank’s resolve to maintain its massive stimulus programme until 2 percent inflation is achieved stably, he also said the country’s economy was expected to continue moderately expanding.\nThe dollar was 0.1-percent lower at 110.90, after earlier falling as far as 110.82 soon after Kuroda’s remarks.\nSterling was steady on the day at $1.3734.\nOn Friday, the British currency jumped to its highest levels against the dollar since the Brexit vote in June, 2016, after a report that the Netherlands and Spain were open to a deal for Britain to remain as close as possible to the European Union.\nThe pound shrugged off a denial from officials from the Spanish and Dutch finance ministries, who said there was no new agreement between the countries on how Britain should leave the EU.\nReporting by Lisa Twaronite; Editing by Joseph Radford\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-01-15T08:58:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-15T16:52:42.017+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
