The vessels left the area,” he was Quote: d as saying.\nThe Iranian army launched two days of exercises on Monday involving ground, naval and air forces in the country’s south and southeast, near the Makran Coast, and other areas in the Gulf of Oman.\nThere have been periodic confrontations between the Iranian and U.S. military in the Gulf - a major trade route for oil - in recent years.\nIn the first such incident since President Donald Trump took office, a U.S. Navy ship fired warning shots when an Iranian vessel approached to within 450 feet (140 meters) last July.\nThe following month an unarmed Iranian drone came within 100 feet (30 meters) of a U.S. Navy warplane as it prepared to land on an aircraft carrier in the Gulf.\nDuring the presidential campaign last September, Trump said any Iranian vessel that harassed the U.S. Navy in the Gulf would be “shot out of the water”.\nReporting by Bozorgmehr Sharafedin; Editing by Toby Chopra and John Stonestreet\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-01-22T16:41:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-22T10:49:10.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
