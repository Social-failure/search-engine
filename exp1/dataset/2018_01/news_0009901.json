It sprinkled quartz sand over the overheated battery so that the smoke could be contained and sucked out after switching on the ventilation.”\nSeven people received medical treatment but did not need to be hospitalised.\nForensic specialists were examining what caused the incident, police said.\nApple had no immediate comment beyond the police statement.
