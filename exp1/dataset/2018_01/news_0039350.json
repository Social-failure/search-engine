This makes sense considering how one-sided (to the upside) the speculative bets have become,\" said Ole Hansen, head of commodity strategy at Saxo Bank.\nThere is now far more demand for options to sell Brent than there is for call options, which are the right to buy Brent at a certain price.\nSukrit Vijayakar energy consultancy Trifecta said the rising options to sell were a result of huge amounts of long positions that have been built up over the past months of rising prices.\n\"We still have...nine long barrels for every short barrel, so a reversal should be interesting to watch,\" he said.\nSTILL STRONG SUPPORT\nDespite this, traders said oil would unlikely tumble far as markets remain supported by strong economic growth and by supply restrictions led by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and Russia.\nRussian Energy Minister Alexander Novak said on Wednesday that an average Brent price of around $60 was a reasonable forecast for this year, Interfax news agency reported.\nIn the latest sign of healthy economic growth, Japanese manufacturing activity expanded at the fastest pace in almost four years in January, a survey showed on Wednesday.\nEconomic growth is translating into oil demand growth and comes at a time that OPEC and Russia lead production cuts aimed at tightening the market. The deal to withhold output started in January last year and is currently set to last through 2018.\nStephen Innes, head of trading for Asia-Pacific at futures brokerage Oanda in Singapore said a \"beaming economic forecast along with stout compliance from OPEC (to withhold production) is providing convincing support.\"\n(Reporting by Henning Gloystein; Editing by Joseph Radford)", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-24T09:51:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-24T11:45:20.030+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
