( bit.ly/2DPIBnb )\nThe World Wildlife Fund estimates there are 104,700 Bornean orangutans, known for their broad faces and dark brown fur, left in the world.\nIndonesia has vast swathes of plantations growing palm oil or coffee on deforested land that conservationists say often encroach on or disrupt ecosystems. Plantation workers sometimes encounter wildlife and may capture or kill the animals.\nData from the Centre for Orangutan Protection shows more than 15 of the creatures had been killed by humans or found dead in unnatural circumstances since 2011.\nAn investigation into the latest case is a test of the bravery of the Environment and Forestry Ministry, Ramadhani said.\nReporting by Jessica Damiana; Writing by Fergus Jensen; Editing by Jacqueline Wong\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-20T12:41:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-20T13:01:00.007+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
