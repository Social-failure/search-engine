(OTC Pink: CSBB):\nFourth Quarter Highlights Quarter Ended Quarter Ended December 31, 2017\nDecember 31, 2016\nDiluted earnings per share $ 0.65 $ 0.72 Net Income $ 1,779,000 $ 1,953,000 Return on average common equity 10.02 % 11.76 % Return on average assets 0.99 % 1.17 % CSB Bancorp, Inc. (OTC Pink: CSBB) today announced fourth quarter 2017 net income of $1,779,000, or $.65 per basic and diluted share, as compared to $1,953,000, or $.72 per basic and diluted share, for the same period in 2016. The Company recognized a $101,000 impact as a result of the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (“TCJA”) in the fourth quarter of 2017, resulting in a $0.04 per share decrease in earnings. Excluding the impact of the TCJA, net income would have been $1,880,000. For the twelve month period ended December 31, 2017 net income totaled $7,101,000, compared to $6,738,000 for the same period last year an increase of 5%.\nAnnualized returns on average common equity (“ROE”) and average assets (“ROA”) for the quarter were 10.02% and 0.99%, respectively, compared with 11.76% and 1.17% for the fourth quarter of 2016.\nEddie Steiner, President and CEO stated, “Loan and deposit balances continued to grow at a fairly steady pace through the fourth quarter. Net interest margin, compared to the same quarter in the prior year, improved for the eighth consecutive quarter.”\nRevenue, on a fully-taxable equivalent basis, totaled $7.7 million during the quarter, a 7% increase from the prior-year fourth quarter. Net interest income increased $505 thousand, or 9%, in the fourth quarter of 2017 compared to the same period in 2016.\nLoan interest income including fees increased $629 thousand during fourth quarter 2017 as compared to the same quarter in 2016. The current quarter’s loan interest income was favorably impacted by $196 thousand in interest and late charges attributable to payoffs of several loan relationships that had been on nonaccrual. Fourth quarter 2016 loan interest income had by comparison included several payoff recoveries and net purchase discount recognition totaling $413 thousand. Additionally, average total loan balances during the current quarter were $48 million higher than the year ago quarter.\nThe net interest margin was 3.84% compared to 3.83% for fourth quarter 2016. Excluding the nonaccrual and purchase discounts the net interest margin for fourth quarter 2017 and 2016 would have been 3.73% and 3.57%, respectively.\nNoninterest income increased by $8 thousand, or 1%, in the fourth quarter of 2017 compared to 2016. The increase reflects growth in debit card fee income and gain on sale of loans. The increase in other income was partially offset by a decline in service charges on deposit accounts and an impairment loss on leasehold assets. Trust and brokerage fees stabilized in the fourth quarter following a year-long decline resulting from broker and administrative changes within the unit.\nNoninterest expense amounted to $4.7 million during the quarter, an increase of $486 thousand, or 12%, from fourth quarter 2016. Salary and employee benefits rose $138 thousand, or 6%, on a quarter over prior year quarter with increases in salary, healthcare, and employment taxes. Professional fees increased by $55 thousand, or 22%, resulting from increased internal audit fees, retained search fees, director fees, and legal fees for loan collection. Marketing and public relations expense increased by $49 thousand, or 53%, on a quarter over quarter basis with expanded channel advertising and increasing community donations. The Company’s fourth quarter efficiency ratio was 61.0% as compared to 58.6% for the same quarter in the prior year.\nFederal income tax provision totaled $901 thousand in fourth quarter 2017, including the TCJA income tax increase adjustment of $101 thousand, as compared to $880 thousand tax provision for the same quarter in 2016.\nAverage total assets during the quarter amounted to $716 million, an increase of $52 million, or 8%, above the same quarter of the prior year. Average loan balances of $512 million increased $48 million, or 10%, from the prior year fourth quarter while average securities balances of $128 million decreased $7 million, or 5%, as compared to fourth quarter 2016.\nAverage commercial loan balances for the quarter, including commercial real estate, increased $30 million, or 10%, from prior year levels. Average residential mortgage balances increased $14 million, or 14%, over the prior year’s quarter. Average consumer credit balances increased $3 million, or 26%, versus the same quarter of the prior year.\nDelinquent loan balances as of December 31, 2017 amounted to 1.53% of total loans as compared to 0.68% at December 31, 2016. Nonperforming assets totaled $6.5 million, or 1.26%, of total loans plus other real estate, an increase of $5 million over December 31, 2016. Approximately $2.9 million of the non-performing loan total is guaranteed by either USDA or the SBA. The increase in nonperforming loans year over year is primarily due to three lending relationships comprised of several loans. All nonperforming loans have been reviewed for impairment, or additional charge-down if collateral dependent, at December 31, 2017. Current impairment on these loans approximates $220 thousand. The allowance for loan losses amounted to 1.08% of total loans on December 31, 2017 as compared to 1.11% at December 31, 2016.\nNet loan losses recognized during fourth quarter 2017 were $12 thousand, or 0.01% annualized, compared to fourth quarter 2016 net loan recoveries of $289 thousand.\nAverage deposit balances for fourth quarter 2017 totaled $579 million, an increase of $47 million, or 9%, from the prior year’s fourth quarter. Within the deposit category, average noninterest-bearing account balances for the fourth quarter increased by $1 million, or 1%, above the same period in the prior year. Average interest-bearing checking, money market, and traditional savings balances increased $48 million, or 20%, from year ago levels, while average time deposit balances decreased $2 million, or 2%, from fourth quarter 2016. In addition to the changes in average deposit balances, the average balance of securities sold under repurchase agreement during the fourth quarter of 2017 decreased by $8 million, or 15%, compared to the average for the same period in the prior year. During 2017, a new corporate overnight cash management product was established within interest-bearing checking and at December 31, 2017 the new product had balances of $21.8 million.\nShareholders’ equity totaled $70.5 million on December 31, 2017 with 2.7 million common shares outstanding. The tangible equity to assets ratio amounted to 9.3% on December 31, 2017 and 9.1% on December 31, 2016. The Company declared a fourth quarter dividend of $0.22 per share producing an annualized yield of 2.7% based on the December 31, 2017 closing price of $33.11.\nAbout CSB Bancorp, Inc.\nCSB is a financial holding company headquartered in Millersburg, Ohio, with approximate assets of $707 million as of December 31, 2017.
