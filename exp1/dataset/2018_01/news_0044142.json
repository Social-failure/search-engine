It left the door open to athletes with no history of doping to compete as “Olympic Athletes from Russia”.\nThe Olympic body earlier this week said that the exclusion of certain athletes from the list of eligible Russians did not necessarily mean they had doped.\nSpeaking alongside Pozdnyakov at the Russia’s Olympic Committee, Sports Minister Pavel Kolobkov said Russia would take legal measures to defend the athletes excluded from the Olympics.\n“We will fight for every last athlete,” Kolobkov said. “We are really hoping for a fair decision by the Court of Arbitration for Sport.”\nHe added that Russia was planning to organize alternative competitions for the athletes excluded from the Olympics.\nReporting by Gabrielle Tétrault-Farber, editing by Larry King\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-25T18:48:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-25T19:01:13.012+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
