The deal, according to WSJ , included keeping the print magazine, which first published in 1953, while Hefner was alive. \nHe died late last year. \nPlayboy Enterprises grew out of Playboy magazine, known for its centerfold nude photos of models and actresses. During its heyday, the magazine also published notable fiction and non-fiction from writers such as Ray Bradbury and Margaret Atwood. \nIn 2016, Playboy magazine stopped publishing nude images of women , but brought them back in 2017. \nThough no final decision has been made about the print magazine, its circulation has declined for years. Meanwhile, Playboy magazine “has lost as much as $7 million annually in recent years,” WSJ reported. \n“Historically, we could justify the losses because of the marketing value, but you also have to be forward thinking,” Kohn told WSJ. “I’m not sure that print is necessarily the best way to communicate to our consumer going forward.” \nA spokesman for Playboy Enterprises had no further comment. Fortune also contacted Brunswick Group, the PR firm representing Rizvi Traverse, and will update as necessary.
