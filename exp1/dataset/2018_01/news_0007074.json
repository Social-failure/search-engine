REUTERS/Amit Dave/File photo \nModi has set an ambitious target of nearly tripling the country’s total renewable energy capacity to 175 gigawatt (GW) by 2022, spurring global firms including Japan’s SoftBank and Goldman Sachs to invest in solar projects in the country. \nMost of the solar modules come from China, but several consignments are now held up because customs officials have demanded that some of them be classified as “electric motors and generators”, attracting a 7.5 percent duty, not as “diodes, transistors and similar semi-conductor devices” with no duty. \nTwo customs officials in the southern port of Chennai confirmed the issue regarding the classification. \nC. Narasimhan, president of the Indian Solar Association, said that up to 2,000 solar module containers are now stranded at four major ports. \n“Port disruptions like this will hamper the country’s progress towards achieving the target of 100 GW in installed solar capacity by 2022,” said Narasimhan, a former lawmaker. \nThe Indian unit of Germany’s Enerparc had 30 of its containers stuck at Chennai for three weeks as it finished some “paperwork” and paid a demurrage - a charge for failing to discharge the ship on time - of about 7 million rupees ($110,471), its Managing Director Santosh Khatelsal said. \nThe renewable energy ministry has already asked the finance ministry to resolve the matter without disrupting business, said a government official with direct knowledge of the matter.
