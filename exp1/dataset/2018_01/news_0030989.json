It also oversees one of the country’s most popular app stores and hosts the country’s biggest gaming and livestream platforms. \nGoogle did not disclose the scope of the new patent deal and Tencent did not immediately respond to questions about which products the patent agreement will cover. \n“By working together on agreements such as this, tech companies can focus on building better products and services for their users,” said Mike Lee, Google’s head of patents. \nOver the past year, Google has indicated that it was looking to increase it presence in the restrictive Chinese market, with the launch of a local AI research lab, introduction of a version of its translation app and expansion into new cities. \nThe company announced this month that it had invested in Chinese livestream gaming app Chushou, which is similar to Google’s own YouTube game livestreaming services. \nIn December, Google CEO Sundar Pichai spoke at a conference in China hosted by the Cyberspace Administration of China, which oversees censorship in the country.
