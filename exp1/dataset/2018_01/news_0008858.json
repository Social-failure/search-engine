The process will start on Jan. 29 but the court may need more than one session to reach a decision, court officials said on Wednesday. \nThe government will then have to licence a casino in the area and issue building permits for Lamda to start excavation work. \nLamda has said 10,000 jobs will be created once construction works start and the project will generate 70,000 jobs within five to six years. \nAfter a crippling recession that cut Greece’s economic output by 25 percent between 2008 and 2016 and sent unemployment to record highs, the country is gradually returning to growth.
