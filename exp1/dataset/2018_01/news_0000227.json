This is a shameful and regrettable fall for a state that claims to be democratic,” Dodon said in a Facebook post.\n“As for my position, I decided not to give in. It’s better that than to spend years explaining why some or other of the compromised ministers were appointed to the post.”\nReporting by Matthias Williams and Pavel Polityuk; editing by Mark Heinrich\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-02T16:02:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-02T16:21:37.007+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
