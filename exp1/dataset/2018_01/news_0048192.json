Analysts estimate the case could result in several billions in fines.\nComyn’s challenges, as he starts on the top job on April 9, will be to help restore the lender’s reputation amid the court case and a looming government inquiry into the sector through a year-long Royal Commission - which has the power to compel witnesses and recommend criminal charges.\nSCEPTICAL ABOUT INTERNAL CANDIDATE Some analysts, however, were sceptical about naming an internal candidate CEO at such a time.\n“All indications were it would be an external appointment, given the AUSTRAC issues are ongoing ... all internal candidates are effectively tarnished by the same brush,” said Omkar Joshi, a portfolio manager at Regal Funds Management.\n“It is a good appointment, don’t get me wrong. He has a good track record and in normal circumstances, I think he would have been given that job anyway.”\nRegal Funds owns CBA shares.\nLivingstone declined to comment on whether Comyn had been cleared by regulators of any accountability or wrong-doing related to AUSTRAC’s claims before the appointment, but said the board had considered he was “fit and proper” in line with corporate rules.\nComyn, who has led the bank’s retail unit since August 2012 after joining the bank in 1999 as a graduate, will receive A$2.2 million ($1.78 million) in annual fixed pay as CEO, lesser than Narev’s A$2.65 million base pay as CBA tries to improve perceptions ahead of the inquiry.\nGrowth at Australia’s “Big Four” banks, among the world’s most valuable, have been hit by tighter credit conditions and competition from technology giants such as Apple Inc, Amazon and Facebook as they introduce mobile payment and banking services.\nCBA has also suffered setbacks in recent years over allegations it used outdated medical information to justify refusing life insurance payouts or gave poor financial advice. CBA shares have shed 17 percent from their 2015 peak. The stock closed up 0.6 percent at A$79.19 on Monday, in line with gains of 0.3 percent in the broader market.\n($1 = 1.2344 Australian dollars)\nReporting by Paulina Duran and Byron Kaye; Editing by Peter Cooney, Jonathan Barrett and Himani Sarkar\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-29T09:02:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-29T09:31:20.024+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
