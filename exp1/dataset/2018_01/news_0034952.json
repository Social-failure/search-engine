RBR had in total around 250 million francs in investments. \nIn a mail to investors seen by Reuters that included the line “Let’s make Credit Suisse great again”, RBR said Credit Suisse’s flagship wealth management business had too many staff in support functions and external contractors. \n“We have proposed a simple solution to solve this problem: build a new IT platform on a green field and gradually transfer all existing customers to the new platform,” it said. \nTo date, Credit Suisse’s board and management have instead pursued a “path of small gradual improvement”, it added, saying the bank risked falling behind rivals. \nRBR said it was convinced it was proposing the right strategy to transform Credit Suisse in the digital age. “The value creation potential is enormous and goes far beyond the doubling of the share price, which we initially communicated,” it added. \nUBS, for instance, is spending 1 billion Swiss francs ($1.04 billion) to standardize its IT platform. \nCredit Suisse declined to comment.
