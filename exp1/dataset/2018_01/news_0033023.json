(NYSE:AMC) from December 20, 2016 through August 1, 2017, inclusive (the “Class Period”), including purchasers in AMC’s secondary public offering on or about February 8, 2017.

When the true details entered the market, the lawsuit claims that investors suffered damages.\nA class action lawsuit has already been filed. If you wish to serve as lead plaintiff, you must move the Court no later than March 13, 2018.
