And despite what some might assume, the deliveries are not done by Hooters Girls. \nEarlier this year, Hooters’ investor Chanticleer announced plans to offer customers digital currency in return for eating at their outlets. The restaurant chain joined a handful of other small-cap stocks that have pushed up their stock price by announcing a link with Bitcoin or blockchain in the past year.
