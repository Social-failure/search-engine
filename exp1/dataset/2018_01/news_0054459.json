This was a communication of the European Union ... We will not have a market access treaty wrapped up by April.” \nBrussels has heaped pressure on Bern to sign a treaty under which non-EU member Switzerland would adopt EU laws governing the single market as the price of enhanced access. It would have the European Court of Justice help settle any disputes. \nThis is anathema to the anti-immigration People’s Party, which is the largest in parliament and has two of seven cabinet seats. Many Swiss conservatives are also wary of giving “foreign judges” such power and are keen to see what kind of EU deal Britain can swing after its vote in 2016 to leave the EU.

The cabinet will never agree something that damages Switzerland, even in the next 40 years,” he said. \nCassis named a new team to handle the Europe portfolio, appointing veteran diplomat Roberto Balzaretti as state secretary in charge of European affairs and the point man for coordinating EU negotiations. \nCassis said Bern was reviewing new approaches to settling disputes that arise under a treaty. He was not more specific, but sources close to the talks have said the EU proposed letting a special arbitration court handle some disputes. \nThe treaty issue is politically fraught ahead of elections in both Switzerland and the EU in 2019, which in effect means any deal has to be done this year. \n“We have around 10 months ahead of us to review the blockade,” Cassis said, referring to the logjam in talks with the EU. “If it works, it works. If not, then it doesn‘t. Then we have to go back over the books and see how it will go. It is clear not much will happen in 2019.” Editing by Mark Heinrich", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-31T20:51:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-31T21:16:21.006+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
