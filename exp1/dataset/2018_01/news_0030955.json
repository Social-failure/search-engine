(NASDAQ:HOMB), parent company of Centennial Bank, today announced net income for the year ended December 31, 2017 of $135.1 million. Diluted earnings per share for the year ended 2017 was $0.89 per share. For the fourth quarter of 2017, the Company recorded a profit of $23.3 million. Diluted earnings per share for the fourth quarter of 2017 was $0.13 per share.\nIn addition to merger expenses and acquisition gain from the 2017 acquisitions, the Company’s annual earnings were significantly impacted by Hurricane Irma and the recently enacted “Tax Cuts and Jobs Act” (the “TCJA”). Excluding the $36.9 million one-time TCJA charge, $33.4 million of hurricane expense, and $25.7 million of merger expenses associated with the 2017 acquisitions offset by $3.8 million of one-time non-taxable gain on acquisition, 2017 annual after-tax earnings excluding non-fundamental items were $204.8 million, an increase of 15.7% from 2016 annual after-tax earnings excluding non-fundamental items of $177.0 million.\nExcluding the $36.9 million one-time TCJA charge, after-tax earnings excluding non-fundamental items for the fourth quarter of 2017 were $60.2 million, an increase of 30.6% from the fourth quarter 2016 after-tax earnings excluding non-fundamental items of $46.1 million.\n“Looking back on the last year, we were active in growing and navigating the Company as we crossed over the $10 billion threshold,” said John Allison, Home’s Chairman. “Home added $3.46 billion in total assets through the completion of three acquisitions and issued $300 million of subordinated debt in an underwritten public offering. While we experienced challenges through the year that largely impacted our earnings, including Hurricane Irma and the tax reform bill, we achieved milestone earnings excluding non-fundamental items of over $200 million for 2017 and over $60 million for the fourth quarter. In 2018, we are well-positioned to continue to execute on opportunities to grow our Company with the focus of improving overall shareholder value.”\nTracy French, Centennial Bank President and Chief Executive Officer added, “We have been hard at work in 2017 managing the growth associated with our 2017 acquisitions. Once we convert the Stonegate core operating systems on February 9, 2018, the Company will be well-positioned to realize the anticipated cost savings, thereby rewarding our shareholders. Our team is focused on this important task and is working to recognize these enhancements as quickly as possible.”\n“Excluding the impact of the tax rate change, we are proud to report outstanding fourth quarter of 2017 earnings of $60.2 million, or $0.35 diluted earnings per share,” said Randy Sims, Home BancShares, Inc. President and Chief Executive Officer. “The Company was also able to maintain a sub-40 core efficiency ratio, reporting 37.35% for the fourth quarter of 2017, despite adding over $3 billion in assets through its 2017 acquisitions. With these excellent results, our shareholders can remain confident that our strong metrics will continue to provide them with solid returns.”\nOperating Highlights\nAccretion yield increased approximately $5.2 million from $7.2 million for the third quarter of 2017 to $12.4 million for fourth quarter of 2017. Each quarter we perform credit impairment tests on the credit impaired loans acquired in our acquisitions. During our fourth quarter 2017 impairment testing, several pools were determined to have a projected credit improvement. This projected credit improvement combined with the added accretion income from the acquisition of Stonegate Bank (“Stonegate”) offset by the expected decline in accretion income from the maturing and reduction of pay-offs in the previously acquired loan portfolios, resulted in a net increase of recognized accretion income when compared to the third quarter of 2017. The net increase of recognized accretion income when compared to the third quarter of 2017 is primarily due to $5.4 million of accretion income added during the fourth quarter of 2017 as a result of the Stonegate acquisition offset by a slight decline in legacy accretion income during the fourth quarter of 2017.\nNet interest margin, on a fully taxable equivalent basis, was 4.47% for the quarter just ended compared to 4.75% for the same quarter in 2016 and compared to 4.40% for the third quarter of 2017. The net interest margin, excluding accretion yield, decreased when comparing the third quarter of 2017 to the fourth quarter of 2017 at 4.07% and 4.01%, respectively.\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2017, the Company recorded a provision for loan loss of $4.9 million compared to $1.7 million in the fourth quarter of 2016. The Company was able to reduce fourth quarter 2016 provision for loan losses as a result of a significant loan recovery from a borrower which was charged-off in 2010. The Company estimates that the fourth quarter 2016 provision for loan losses was reduced by $4.5 million as a result of this loan recovery. For the fourth quarter of 2017, net charge-offs were $6.3 million compared to net recoveries of $1.9 million for the fourth quarter of 2016.\nThe Company reported $27.3 million of non-interest income for the fourth quarter of 2017, compared to $23.8 million for the fourth quarter of 2016. The most important components of the fourth quarter non-interest income were $10.1 million from other service charges and fees, $6.6 million from service charges on deposits accounts, $3.6 million from mortgage lending income, $2.9 million from other income and $1.2 million gain on securities, net.\nNon-interest expense for the fourth quarter of 2017 was $63.2 million compared to $47.5 million for the fourth quarter of 2016, an increase of $15.7 million. This increase is primarily the result of an increase in the costs associated with asset growth from the three acquisitions during 2017 combined with approximately $723,000 of growth in quarterly non-interest expense related to the Centennial Commercial Finance Group (“Centennial CFG”). For the fourth quarter of 2017, our core efficiency ratio was 37.35% which increased from the 35.97% reported for fourth quarter of 2016.\nFinancial Condition\nTotal loans receivable were $10.33 billion at December 31, 2017 compared to $7.39 billion at December 31, 2016. Total deposits were $10.39 billion at December 31, 2017 compared to $6.94 billion at December 31, 2016. Total assets were $14.45 billion at December 31, 2017 compared to $9.81 billion at December 31, 2016.\nDuring 2017, the Company acquired $2.82 billion of loans, net of purchase accounting discounts. As of December 31, 2017, the Company produced approximately $125.2 million of organic loan growth since December 31, 2016. Centennial CFG produced $295.5 million of net organic loan growth during 2017 while the legacy and Stonegate footprints experienced significant net payoffs during 2017, resulting in a decline of $153.9 million and $16.5 million, respectively.\nFrom September 30, 2017 to December 31, 2017, the Company experienced organic loan growth of approximately $45.0 million. During the fourth quarter of 2017, Centennial CFG produced $181.8 million of organic loan growth, while the legacy and Stonegate footprints experienced significant net payoffs resulting in a decline of $113.2 million and $23.6 million, respectively. Centennial CFG had loans of $1.40 billi", "external_links": ["https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=Z3OgxCRhhUQn2LWBAuqT6KYknDaNZJrMr3yDL8QgNwwglv2Zzuk_h6fvnK8XI_tkTQ1AKm_pjGYhO0cg2dpPCJeoIOIwqcQVsgzj2B6AzWtt-Zdlebjd7qGAsxJiwBnt", "http://dpregister.com/10115147", "https://www.globenewswire.com/NewsRoom/AttachmentNg/955ca3a3-ef71-4241-95bf-612b13009dae", "https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=HiCwnGALWotpqt6a8uBRtMphJj7Rlhk12eqY1htSExlwyJ1hMMPV0apUsr0_fbx9fGAvFUxYlAgNb6BxpcJ2ws6ghthc-3Iso2VtEguXjJE="], "published": "2018-01-18T16:15:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-18T16:32:07.023+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
