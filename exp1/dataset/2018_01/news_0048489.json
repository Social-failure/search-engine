While U.S. President Donald Trump, who has advocated a strong dollar, tried to row back from those comments, the damage had already been done and the greenback’s downturn since November showed little sign of abating.\nAgainst a basket of currencies .DXY, the dollar bounced a quarter of a percent higher to 89.30 after scoring six consecutive weeks of losses.\nOn a monthly basis it is set to fall 3 percent.\nOver the last decade, including the global financial crisis in 2008, it has fallen by that extent only 10 times, according to Thomson Reuters data.\nReuters data points to market expectations of about three more Federal Reserve rate hikes this year, starting in March, although some analysts, including at Goldman Sachs and JP Morgan Asset Management expect the Fed to raise four times.\nU.S. Treasury yields climbed to fresh multi-year highs in European trade on Monday, extending rises seen last week as investors braced for major central banks to step back from ultra-easy monetary policies. The 10-year yield rose to 2.71 percent, its highest since early 2014.\nFRANC WEAKNESS The Swiss franc was the day’s underperformer, declining more than a quarter of a percent against the dollar and weaker against the crosses after weekly deposits data showed a pick up in capital outflows.\nThe franc has traditionally been a countercyclical currency for global funds as it tends to gain when risk aversion is on the rise and vice versa, although that correlation has weakened thanks to central banks’ unconventional monetary policies.\nBut as the European Central Bank starts to unwind its multi-year policy stimulus starting this month, market watchers expect the Swiss currency to weaken substantially as domestic investors look to international markets for better returns.\n“We expect the SNB (Swiss National Bank) to lag the other European central banks in normalizing monetary policy as the exchange rate remains highly overvalued and as outflows from the Swiss market have picked up pace. That should be a relief for the SNB,” said Kamal Sharma, a director of G10 FX strategy at Bank of America Merrill Lynch.\nWhile the franc CHF= edged 0.3 percent weaker against a broadly struggling dollar, it was also on the back foot against the euro, with the currency stabilizing above the 1.16 line.\nUBS Wealth Management expects the franc to weaken to 1.19 against the euro EURCHF= as the gap between ECB policy withdrawal and SNB’s precautionary stance is likely to widen.\nChairman Thomas Jordan reaffirmed the SNB’s view on the currency earlier this month, saying the Swiss franc remained “highly valued” and negative interest rates were still needed.\nThe euro EUR=EBS traded at $1.2400, down 0.2 percent and off a three-year peak of $1.2538 touched on Thursday.\nThe single currency’s failure over the past couple of days to stay above $1.25 is seen by some traders as a sign of fatigue in its six-week old rally.\nData from U.S. financial watchdog the Commodity Futures Trading Commission showed speculators’ net long position in the euro/dollar futures traded in Chicago rose to a record high, suggesting that profit-taking could be on the cards. 1099741NNET\nReporting by Saikat Chatterjee; Editing by Catherine Evans\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-01-29T09:17:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-29T11:43:59.013+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
