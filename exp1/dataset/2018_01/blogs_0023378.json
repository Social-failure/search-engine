S&P on Thursday cut Brazil's credit rating deeper into junk territory as doubts grew   its costly pension system. \nThe move was widely expected after lawmakers last December pushed a key vote on the unpopular pension bill to February. Investors see the pension overhaul, a landmark proposal of President Michel Temer, as crucial to curtailing public debt and safeguarding long-term economic growth. Some said the downgrade could help Temer pressure lawmakers into approving the plan to avoid further damage. \"The government will certainly use this downgrade to pressure Congress, though it is still highly uncertain whether it will be successful in doing so,\" analysts at Coinvalores brokerage wrote in a client note. Equities in real estate and utilities were among the decliners on Brazil's benchmark Bovespa stock index while the real remained flat. The Mexican peso strengthened 1.13 percent, helped that he would be \"flexible\" on his threat to withdraw from the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) because Mexico faces a presidential election in July. \"Trump's statements helped the Mexican currency to cut losses and reach its best level yet in 2018. Investors now believe that the NAFTA renegotiation process will continue,\" CI Bank said in a report. The next round of negotiations will take place later this month. Mexico's benchmark IPC index gained slightly, partially pushed by bank Grupo Financiero Banorte, whose shares rose 2.74 percent. \nKey Latin American stock indexes and currencies at 2050 GMT: \nStock indexes Latest Daily YTD pct pct change \nchange \nMSCI Emerging Markets 1,209.71 1.06 3.33 MSCI LatAm 2,990.31 0.96 4.73 Brazil Bovespa 79,349.12 -0.02 3.86 Mexico IPC 49,141.69 0.7 -0.43 Chile IPSA 5,733.35 0.27 3.03 Chile IGPA 28,829.85 0.26 3.03 Argentina MerVal 32,762.66 2.13 8.97 Colombia IGBC 11,623.57 -0.22 2.22 Venezuela IBC 1,649.36 18.57 30.58 Currencies Latest Daily YTD pct pct change \nchange \nBrazil real 3.2058 -0.03 3.35 Mexico peso 19.0590 1.13 3.36 Chile peso 602.86 0.40 1.96 Colombia peso 2,859.55 -0.23 4.28 Peru sol 3.216 0.06 0.65 Argentina peso 18.6800 0.16 -0.43 \n(interbank) \nArgentina peso (parallel) 19.49 -0.41 -1.33 \n(Reporting by Bruno Federowski, Flavia Bohone, Daina Beth Solomon and Miguel Angel Gutierrez; Editing by Bernadette Baum and Diane Craft)", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-13T00:21:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-13T01:22:51.002+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
