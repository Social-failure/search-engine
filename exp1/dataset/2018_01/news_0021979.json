[nL4N1OK2OD]\nGlobe’s board has approved a capital expenditure budget of $850 million for this year, saying it seeks to improve internet services in the Philippines, “with the goal of becoming an admired nation for having first world internet connectivity”.\nReporting by Enrico dela Cruz; additional reporting by Karen Lema in Manila and Shida Yoshiyasu in Tokyo, editing by David Evans\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-01-14T23:58:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-15T16:53:46.008+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
