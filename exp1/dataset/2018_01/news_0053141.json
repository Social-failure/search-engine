REFEREEING ERROR \nThe Scots should have qualified for the 2015 Rugby World Cup semi-finals but for a referring error, while last November and now under former flyhalf Gregor Townsend, they came within one pass of beating New Zealand for the first time. \nWales coach Warren Gatland also led the British and Irish Lions to his homeland last year and sealed a series draw, while former Otago Highlanders coach Jamie Joseph is in charge of Japan and Milton Haig leads European dark horses Georgia. \nBoyd took over at the Hurricanes in 2015 and led the side to two Super Rugby finals, winning their first title in 2016, and the semi-finals last year. \nDespite his success at Super Rugby level, he said he had no immediate plans beyond Northampton and was not looking at the job as a springboard into the international arena. \n“I don’t really work on goals,” said Boyd, who was a technical advisor with Tonga during the 2011 Rugby World Cup. \n”If you’re in something, you want to do the best you can and if it works out well then another door will open. If it doesn‘t, then the doors close. \n”I didn’t really have a goal of coaching international football. \n“If you ask me where you think I’ll be in three years’ time, I actually have no idea.” Reporting by Greg Stutchbury; Editing by Ken Ferris", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-30T02:31:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-30T02:58:20.023+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
