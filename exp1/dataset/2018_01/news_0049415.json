Coal deliveries have been made a priority, she added, underscoring growing concern in the government as cold weather sweeps across swathes of the nation. \nThe transport congestion, which will take time to clear, will also affect grain and fertiliser shipments. \nThermal coal futures on Monday rose more than 1 percent to 679.8 yuan (£76.2) per tonne, their highest since the contract launched in 2015. \n“The price rally is being driven by blizzard weather across the country, which has blocked highways and even rail transportation in some places and boosted demand for heating,” said Xu Bo, analyst at Haitong Futures. \n“It is hard to ease tight coal supply in a short period since China is currently at its peak period for heating.” FILE PHOTO: Carriages loaded with coal are seen at a mine pit of Huaibei Mining Group in Huaibei, Anhui province, China January 11, 2018. China Daily via REUTERS/File Photo \nPrices have jumped 11 percent this year, extending a months-long rally and putting them on track for their best monthly performance since June last year. COAL PILING UP \nCoal traders said the bottleneck caused by extreme winter weather highlighted the fragility of the country’s freight rail network, even after China’s breakneck expansion over the past decade of its passenger train capacity. \nChina’s main coal mining hubs are in the northern regions of Inner Mongolia and Shanxi.

The same thing has happened at ports. They don’t have trucks and rail to get them out,” said a Beijing-based physical trader. \nInventory at the country’s three major coal ports - Qinhuangdao, Caofeidian and Jingtang - stood at 8.3 million tonnes on Monday, 10 percent higher than at this time last year. \nXu said he expected coal prices to fall eventually as they were already above levels China’s utilities could afford. \nThe utilities are under particular pressure this winter because of low natural gas supplies after Beijing ordered millions of households and some industrial plants in northern China to change to gas heating from coal as part of its war on pollution. EMERGENCY MEASURES \nRenewing worries about winter heating crisis, Jiangxi and Hunan provinces introduced power rationing to industrial users due to heavy snowfall, with snowy storms also striking parts of the provinces of Anhui, Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Hubei and Hunan. \nIn Jiangsu, the authorities posted a letter dated Jan. 26 on their website asking utilities to ensure sufficient power for heating because of bad weather and snarled transportation. \nJiangsu province has 7.46 million tonnes of coal inventory, enough for 13 days of demand, but seven utilities have less than seven days of stock, the notice warned.
