He left on Jan. 9. \nMalik hopes to launch his as-yet unnamed New York-based firm in the first half of the year, the person said, and is meeting with potential equity investors and clients. He is also exploring the possibility of a joint venture with an existing business. \nHedge funds, known for relatively high fees and limited access, have faced a more difficult fundraising environment in recent years as their performance has often lagged the stock market and other benchmarks. \nDespite the industry’s woes, prime brokerage relationships are highly sought-after by banks for the fees that can be earned from hedge fund trades. \nAt Bank of America, Malik also led its emerging manager program, which worked with smaller hedge fund managers to provide financing and business consulting. \nBefore Bank of America, Malik worked at Jon Corzine’s now-defunct brokerage MF Global Holdings Ltd and as a corporate attorney at Weil, Gotshal & Manges LLP.
