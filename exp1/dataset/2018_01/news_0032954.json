Russia’s Rosneft and India’s ONGC control 20 percent each. Japanese consortium SODECO owns 30 percent.\nAn Exxon Mobil spokesman in Moscow, Andrey Kurbatov, said no one was injured and no facilities damaged.\n“It is expected that gas supplies will be restored soon,” he said.\nThe project delivers limited supplies of natural gas to the Khabarovsk region. Fully fledged gas development has been hampered by the lack of an agreement with Gazprom, which has a monopoly on Russian gas exports by pipeline.
