Malabu has never commented on the case and Reuters has not been able to contact it.\nShell last year said it knew some of its payment to the Nigerian government as part of the deal would go to Malabu “to settle its claim on the block”, but that it was a legal transaction.\nThere are also ongoing investigations regarding the deal in Nigeria and the Netherlands, where Shell is based.\nThe license for the offshore block was awarded to Malabu in 1998 under then-President Sani Abacha, but Shell finalised a deal for the block with the Nigerian government in 2011.\nA British court, in a judgement late last year that agreed to return to Nigeria $85 million in frozen funds related to the deal, said that Malabu was controlled by Etete.
