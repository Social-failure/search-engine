I don’t know if we keep playing in these very, very hard surfaces what’s going to happen in the future with our lives.” MAJESTIC PERFORMANCE Tennis - Australian Open - Quarterfinals - Rod Laver Arena, Melbourne, Australia, January 23, 2018. Spain's Rafael Nadal receives medical attention during his match against Croatia's Marin Cilic. REUTERS/Issei Kato \nIt overshadowed a majestic performance from sixth seed Cilic who reached his second Australian Open semi-final eight years after losing to Murray at the 2010 tournament. \nBashing forehands as if felling trees with an axe, the 2014 U.S. Open champion struck a mind-boggling 83 winners to set up a clash with 49th-ranked Briton Kyle Edmund, one of the more unlikely semi-finals imaginable. \n“It was an unbelievable performance from both of us and it’s really unfortunate for Rafa,” the mild-mannered Cilic told Jim Courier during his post-match interview. \n“He always gives his best and it’s unfortunate for him to end this way.” Slideshow (2 Images) \nCilic will be favored to reach his first final in Australia after showing courage to battle back twice against Nadal. \nAfter dropping the first set, things looked grim when he double-faulted to go down a break in the second but he roared through four consecutive games in a stunning turnaround. \nAlthough reading Nadal’s serve with ease, the Croatian missed out on a number of break points, and he gave the Spaniard a free set point in the tiebreak when he hammered a forehand long. \nNadal bellowed in celebration after closing it out with an overhead smash but Cilic ripped the momentum straight back from the Spaniard.
