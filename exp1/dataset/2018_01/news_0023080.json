REUTERS/Michaela Rehle \nThe SPD had planned to reinvent itself in opposition after a poor election showing in September but was persuaded to enter the talks when Merkel’s attempt to form a coalition with two smaller parties failed in November. SLIDING IN POLLS \nThe latest INSA poll showed the SPD slipping to 18.5 percent, its worst result in that particular survey, and weaker still than the 20.5 percent it achieved in September’s election - which was its poorest performance since 1933. \nThe coalition question has split the SPD with branches in Berlin and the eastern state of Saxony-Anhalt recommending their members vote against. The Jusos youth faction is on a “No Grand Coalition” tour to rally delegates to reject the talks. \nNorbert Roemer, head of the SPD’s parliamentary group in North Rhine-Westphalia said results of the exploratory talks did not make clear enough that there would be a fresh start. \nHe told the Sueddeutsche Zeitung newspaper: “In our party - and this is true of me too - there’s a lot of mistrust of Ms Merkel and her troops.” \nThe most divisive issues for the two blocs concern taxes, pensions, migration and healthcare but both parties are aware that a grand coalition is one of the last options on the table. \nRefusal by SPD delegates to hold further talks could lead to new elections or a minority Merkel-led government for the first time in the post-war era.
