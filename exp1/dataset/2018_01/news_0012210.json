(NYSE: MSM) , \"MSC\" or the \"Company,\" a premier distributor of Metalworking and Maintenance, Repair and Operations (\"MRO\") products and services to industrial customers throughout North America, today reported financial results for its fiscal 2018 first quarter ended December 2, 2017. The Company also announced that its Board of Directors approved an additional 2 million share repurchase authorization, bringing the total current authorization to approximately 2.8 million shares.\nFinancial Highlights 1\nFY18 Q1\nFY17 Q1\nChange\nNet Sales\n$768.6\n$686.3\n12.0%\nOperating Income\n99.3\n90.6\n9.6%\n% of Net Sales\n12.9%\n13.2%\nNet Income\n59.6\n54.3\n9.8%\nDiluted EPS\n$1.05\n2\n$0.96\n3\n9.4%\n1 In millions unless noted. 2 Based on 56.5 million diluted shares outstanding for FY18 Q1. 3 Based on 56.6 million diluted shares outstanding for FY17 Q1.\nErik Gershwind, president and chief executive officer, said, \"The environment remained solid in the first fiscal quarter, and our own business reflected this momentum, with growth rates improving or holding steady across all customer types. We delivered low double-digit sales growth on an ADS basis, and another quarter of sequential gross margin stability and productivity improvements, with operating expenses as a percentage of revenue declining once again.\"\nRustom Jilla, executive vice president and chief financial officer, added, \"Our reported average daily sales rose 12%, operating margin was 12.9%, and EPS rose by 9.4% over the prior year's fiscal first quarter. Excluding our recently acquired DECO business, our quarterly average daily sales rose 7.7% over the same period a year ago, our gross margin was down slightly, our operating expenses to sales improved, and our operating margin expanded by 20 basis points to 13.4%. * We also had a strong quarter in terms of cash generation, with net cash provided by operating activities up 8% to $82 million. Finally, the recently announced 21% quarterly dividend increase and the additional share repurchase authorization are reflective of the significant positive impact of tax reform on our earnings and cash flow, as well as our ongoing commitment to allocating capital to enhance total shareholder returns.\"\nGershwind concluded, \"Looking forward, it is an exciting time for U.S. manufacturing and MSC on multiple fronts. First, after several years of a weak pricing environment, many suppliers have now raised list prices, and we expect to follow suit in the near-term. Second, customer sentiment and industry indices are positive, pointing to continued U.S. manufacturing growth prospects. And third, we see the recent tax reform as a significant tailwind not just for our own EPS, but also for our customers and the broader manufacturing economy in the coming years. We are well positioned to take advantage of this better environment, particularly given the improvements that we have made to our business in recent years.\"\nThe Company has increased its buyback authorization by 2 million shares. The timing and actual number of shares repurchased will depend on a variety of factors, including price, market conditions, and applicable legal and regulatory requirements. The share repurchase program does not obligate the Company to repurchase any specific number of shares and may be suspended or terminated at any time without prior notice.\nOutlook\nBased on current market conditions, the Company expects net sales for the second quarter of fiscal 2018 to be between $761 million and $775 million. At the midpoint, average daily sales are expected to increase roughly 9.1% compared to last year's second quarter. The Company's guidance for diluted earnings per share for the second quarter of fiscal 2018 is $1.93 to $2.03, which includes the following components:\nAn estimated beneficial impact of between $0.27 to $0.29 from the lower effective tax rate (combined federal and state) required to bring our first half into alignment with the expected full year rate; and An estimated net one-time beneficial impact of between $0.66 and $0.70 that reflects the re-valuation of tax-related balance sheet items. An estimated diluted earnings per share for the second quarter of fiscal 2018, excluding the positive impacts of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act noted above, of between $1.00 and $1.04.\nConference Call Information\nMSC will host a conference call today at 8:30 a.m. EST to review the Company's fiscal 2018 first quarter results.
