I did feel like a rookie. I was trying to learn as I went. \n“Right now, after a year, I feel a lot more comfortable. I feel like I have what I didn’t have then, which is a developed routine of what to do each week.” \nThe 23-year-old has learnt not to overdo things during a tournament, keeping practise to a minimum. He is also learning how to balance an international schedule without wearing himself out. \nHe has resisted the lure of heading to the Middle East this week or next for lucrative European Tour events, instead focussing on the PGA Tour’s West Coast swing. \n“I want to play both tours,” he said. “I need to pace myself.” \nMickelson, 24 years Rahm’s senior, is serving as something of a mentor to the Spaniard and the pair often play practise rounds together. \nMickelson’s brother Tim was Rahm’s coach at ASU, as well as his former agent before he began caddying for Phil last year. \nMickelson is winless since his 2013 British Open victory at Muirfield, having accrued five runner-up finishes since then without lifting a trophy. \nHe starts his 2018 campaign after more than two months off, seeking his third victory at a tournament he previously won in 2002 and 2004, albeit at different courses. \nThe format uses three courses, with the field playing three rounds -- one on each course -- before the cut is made for the final round at the host PGA West Stadium Course in La Quinta.
