Federer then took control, producing a neat backhand volley to close out the first set.\nThe second set went with serve up to 4-4 before Sock missed an opportunity to break. The American world number eight then double-faulted at 5-5 as Federer pounced to snatch a decisive break and went on to seal the win.\n“I’ve maintained a high level in all three matches, which is a great thing,” Federer said after the match.\n“This was another step up in terms of ranking and I thought it was a very entertaining match for both of us... I thought it was a good step forward.”\nBencic secured the victory for Switzerland with a 7-6(6) 6-4 win over Vandeweghe. Federer and Bencic then won the dead mixed doubles rubber 4-3(3) 4-2.\nGroup B winners Switzerland will face the winner of Group A in Saturday’s final, with Germany, Belgium and Australia all capable of sealing top spot.\nEarlier, Naomi Osaka ground out a 6-4 3-6 7-6(5) win over Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova but Japan failed to capitalize on the early advantage as they lost 2-1 to Russia.\nKaren Khachanov thumped Yuichi Sugita 6-4 6-2 before teaming up with Pavlyuchenkova to beat the pair of Sugita and Osaka 4-1 4-0 in the mixed doubles rubber.\nReporting by Shrivathsa Sridhar in Bengaluru Editing by Jeremy Gaunt.\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-04T17:44:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-04T18:05:21.001+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
