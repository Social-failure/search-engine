We think this is the right course of action, but it will take time to work, will drive near-term unit revenues down and risk a competitive response,” Corridore wrote. “We will wait to see how this plays out before recommending shares.”\nUnited’s financial results came on the heels of an uplifting fourth-quarter and full-year review from rival Delta Air Lines earlier this month.\nAmerican Airlines, Southwest Airlines ( LUV.N ), JetBlue Airways ( JBLU.O ) and Alaska Airlines ( ALK.N ) disclose their results on Thursday.\nReporting by Alana Wise in New York and Rachit Vats in Bengaluru; Editing by Supriya Kurane and Susan Thomas\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-24T16:24:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-24T16:44:13.007+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
