Opposition teams know Dan Biggar pretty well, so we could potentially have a flyhalf that the opposition don’t know a lot about.” \nGatland was quick to rebuff the suggestion that Wales had looked to add more variety to their attack under Howley after years of power-based “Warrenball”, saying the approach was more often based on availability than philosophy. \n”I think we’ve always been expansive,“ he said. ”We’ve had an attacking focus depending on personnel. Making sure you can use quick ball or using physical players like George North and Jamie Roberts to get across gain line and play off that, you’ve got to balance your attack. \n“If you have a different player at 12 then that changes.” \nAfter winning back to back titles in 2012 and 2013 Wales have dropped off in recent seasons and finished fifth last year after three defeats. \nGatland, however, said that was a reflection of the strength of the competition and pointed out that in three of those seasons they still lost only one game. \n“We’re pleased at how we’ve done. Our win ratio is about 75 percent since I’ve been involved,” he said. “I think it’s a fantastic record but its a tough tournament to win.” Reporting by Mitch Phillips; Editing by Keith Weir", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-24T16:59:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-24T17:37:19.032+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
