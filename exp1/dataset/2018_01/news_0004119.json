Target is the ideal offline partner for Amazon for two reasons, shared demographic and manageable but comprehensive store count,\" Munster wrote in a post on Monday. \"As for the demographic, Target's focus on mom[s] is central to Amazon's approach to win wallet share.\"\nMunster was an influential technology analyst with Piper Jaffray for 21 years before co-founding venture capital firm Loup at the start of last year.\nMunster said Amazon has \"aggressively pursued\" the family market with promotions for kid-friendly video content. In addition, an acquisition of Target will increase the company's store count to roughly 2,300 stores, which will allow it to compete with Walmart 's nearly 12,000 store footprint, according to the analyst.\nAmazon closed its $13.7 billion acquisition of Whole Foods Market in August.\n\"As for retail stores, Amazon's acquisition of Whole Foods 470 stores along with testing of the Amazon Go retail concept is evidence that Amazon see[s] the future of retail as a combination of mostly online and some offline,\" he wrote.\nAmazon shares rose 56 percent in 2017 versus Target stock's 10 percent decline.\nTarget shares rose 3.7 percent Tuesday. Amazon and Target declined to comment for this story.\nâ€” CNBC's Patricia Martell contributed to this story.\nDisclaimer WATCH: Amazon's big plans for Alexa ads in 2018 show chapters Amazon has big plans for Alexa ads in 2018 3 Hours Ago | 00:55", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-02T16:03:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-02T16:18:52.005+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
