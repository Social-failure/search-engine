China said it did not pursue protectionist policies.\n“In a world that looks benign for emerging markets, the biggest risk is probably a U.S.-China trade war,” said Tim Ash, a strategist at BlueBay Asset Management. “We’ve had a very long run in EM without a correction so could this be the trigger?”\nTrump is due to speak at the Davos forum on Friday.\nChinese mainland shares fell 0.6 percent, easing from two-year highs, and Hong Kong stocks fell 0.9 percent, their biggest one-day fall in a month.\nBut other Asian manufacturing hubs pushed higher, with South Korea shares up almost 1 percent to close at a record high. The index was boosted by chipmaker SK Hynix, which gained 4.7 percent after it posted a record profit. Samsung Electronics also rose nearly 2 percent.\nMany emerging currencies hit multi-year highs against the dollar which is languishing near three-year low after U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin departed from traditional U.S. currency policy saying “obviously a weaker dollar is good for us”.\nChina’s yuan firmed to its strongest since November 2015 for its biggest one-day rise in almost two years. It has gained 2.7 percent against the sliding dollar so far this year, following a rise of about 6.8 percent in 2017, and is set for its biggest monthly gain ever.\n“As long as the dollar weakness persists, the Chinese authorities will let the currency fly,” Commerzbank analysts wrote.\nThe Malaysian ringgit climbed 0.5 percent to a near two-year peak after the central bank raised rates for the first time in 3-1/2 years. The baht hit four-year highs.\nBut the weak dollar failed to help the South African rand , which fell 0.4 percent from 2-1/2 year highs after a strong run. The Turkish lira also remained under pressure, with Trump warning Turkey to curtail its military operation in Syria.\nThe Polish zloty briefly hit a 2-1/2 year high against the euro.\nUkraine’s central bank is also in focus and while most analysts expect steady rates after two hikes in a row, Ash said a rise was possible.\n“Inflation has been sticky, the currency has been weak, there are no positives on the reform front and the central bank will try to prove its credibility. How better to do that than raise rates?” he said.\nBrazilian markets could be in for another strong day after an appeals court upheld the corruption conviction of former President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, possibly derailing his plans to run again for the presidency.\nThe real surged almost 3 percent on Wednesday, and stocks hit a new intraday high, closing up 3.7 percent, their biggest one-day gain in over a year.\nBrazil’s five-year credit default swaps also fell 10 basis points to 145 bps.\nInvestors hope Lula’s exclusion from the 2018 race will clear the way for a more market-friendly candidate who can stick to Brazil’s austerity agenda.\nFor GRAPHIC on emerging market FX performance 2017, see tmsnrt.rs/2e7eoml For GRAPHIC on MSCI emerging index performance 2017, see tmsnrt.rs/2dZbdP5\nFor CENTRAL EUROPE market report, see\nFor TURKISH market report, see\nFor RUSSIAN market report, see) Emerging Markets Prices from Reuters Equities Latest Net Chg % Chg % Chg\non year\nMorgan Stanley Emrg Mkt Indx 1260.64 +1.89 +0.15 +8.82\nCzech Rep 1130.59 -7.98 -0.70 +4.86\nPoland 2612.82 -8.77 -0.33 +6.16\nHungary 40708.06 -271.71 -0.66 +3.38\nRomania 8418.26 -18.15 -0.22 +8.57\nGreece 881.96 -2.02 -0.23 +9.92\nRussia 1307.81 +15.49 +1.20 +13.29\nSouth Africa 54233.13 -342.81 -0.63 +3.24\nTurkey 19729.83 +81.45 +0.07 +3.81\nChina 3548.30 -11.16 -0.31 +7.29\nIndia 36104.49 -57.15 -0.16 +6.01\nCurrencies Latest Prev Local Local\nclose currency currency\n% change % change\nin 2018\nCzech Rep 25.40 25.38 -0.09 +0.49\nPoland 4.15 4.15 +0.07 +0.66\nHungary 309.24 309.12 -0.04 +0.42\nRomania 4.66 4.66 -0.04 +0.29\nSerbia 118.56 118.65 +0.08 -0.13\nRussia 55.86 56.15 +0.53 +3.22\nKazakhstan 320.11 320.96 +0.27 +3.96\nUkraine 28.72 28.80 +0.28 -2.00\nSouth Africa 11.88 11.85 -0.28 +4.03\nKenya 102.40 102.20 -0.20 +0.68\nIsrael 3.40 3.41 +0.16 +2.20\nTurkey 3.74 3.74 -0.10 +1.28\nChina 6.32 6.37 +0.71 +2.95\nIndia 63.58 63.65 +0.11 +0.40\nBrazil 3.15 3.15 +0.00 +5.27\nMexico 18.47 18.49 +0.13 +6.38\nDebt Index Strip Spd Chg %Rtn Index\nSov‘gn Debt EMBIG 295 0 .10 8 06.95 1\nReporting by Claire Milhench; additional reporting by Sujata Rao; Editing by Janet Lawrence\n ", "external_links": ["http://tmsnrt.rs/2dZbdP5", "http://tmsnrt.rs/2e7eoml", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-01-25T18:50:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-26T21:25:07.028+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
