Rival Etihad Airways announced last year it would cancel flights to San Francisco and Dallas Forth Worth.\nThe electronics restrictions were lifted in July 2017, though a third version of a policy banning citizens of some countries from entering the U.S. remains.\nEmirates did not say when it plans to increase services to Boston, Los Angeles, and Seattle, which were also reduced last year.\n”We continue to closely monitor the situation with the view to reinstate and grow our U.S. flight operations as soon as viable,” an Emirates spokeswoman told Reuters.\nThe airline also said Thursday that it would add a daily, direct Boeing ( BA.N ) 777 service to Newark Liberty International Airport in New Jersey from June 1 but drop one of its four daily Airbus ( AIR.PA ) A380 flights to nearby New York City’s John F. Kennedy Airport from March 25.\nEmirates already operates a daily flight to Newark via Athens, Greece from Dubai, and one of its remaining three daily New York flights is operated via Milan, Italy from Dubai.\nReporting by Alexander Cornwell; Editing by Keith Weir\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-01-25T17:46:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-25T12:53:52.004+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
