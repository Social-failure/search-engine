The warning level for the peak was raised to 3, warning people not to climb the mountain. \nCamera footage taken at the resort showed what looked like rocks flying through the air, along with a wave of black smoke. \nFour people riding a gondola on the slopes were injured by broken glass, chief cabinet secretary Yoshihide Suga told a news conference. Television news channels reported as many as 15 people may have been injured by rocks thrown out by the volcano. \nJapan has 110 active volcanoes and monitors 47 of them around the clock. In September 2014, 63 people were killed on Mount Ontake, the worst volcanic disaster in Japan for nearly 90 years.
