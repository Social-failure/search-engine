AQAP also has boasted of the world’s most feared bomb makers, Ibrahim Hassan al-Asiri, and the Pentagon estimates it has between about 2,000 and 3,000 fighters. \nBatarfi said Muslims in Western countries, including the United States, were obliged to target the interests of Jews and the Americans. \n“They must be eager to prepare themselves as much as possible, and to carry out jihadi operations against them,” he added, according to SITE. \nPalestinians seek East Jerusalem, including the walled Old City with its holy sites, as the capital of their own future state. Israel, which annexed East Jerusalem after capturing it in 1967 in a move not internationally recognised, regards all of the city as its “eternal and indivisible capital”.
