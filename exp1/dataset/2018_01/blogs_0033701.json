This breakout leads him to believe that should the stock dip, it could still bounce from the $217 level.\nIn advance of Nvidia's earnings report on Feb. 8, Gordon wants to sell the February monthly 220-strike put and pair that with the purchase of the February monthly 215-strike put. This would allow Gordon to collect a credit of $2.08, or $208, should Nvidia close above $220 on the Feb. 16 expiration.\nBut if Nvidia closes below $215 on expiration, then Gordon could lose $285. While Nvidia was trading at $224 on Wednesday, the trader wants to establish a point at which to step out.\n\"If the support at about $217 is broken, the reason for being in this trade is wrong,\" he said.\nNvidia has soared 118 percent in the past year.\nVote Vote to see results Total Votes: Not a Scientific Survey.
