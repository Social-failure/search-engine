The 2018 budget still has not passed through Congress, the U.S. officials said on condition of anonymity. \nOne of the officials said the request would closely follow the priorities unveiled by Defense Secretary Jim Mattis on Friday in the National Defense Strategy. \nMattis put countering China and Russia at the center of the new National Defense Strategy. \nThe Pentagon’s unclassified, 11-page version of the National Defense Strategy did not provide details on how the shift towards countering China and Russia would be carried out, but defense spending requests were expected to reflect that aim. \nThe U.S. military’s competitive edge has eroded “in every domain of warfare” Mattis said, partly because of inconsistent funding. Congress voted on Monday to end a three-day U.S. government shutdown, approving the latest short-term funding bill as Democrats accepted promises from Republicans for a broad debate later on the future of young illegal immigrants. \nThe Washington Post published the figures for the president’s budget request earlier on Friday afternoon.
