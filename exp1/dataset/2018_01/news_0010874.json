He declined to say how long into 2019 the policy of holding rates might extend. \n“We’re not going to do anything original. There is a disparity in rates (between Poland and other countries) at around 2 percent and nothing will be changed here,” he said. \nDespite expectations that growth in gross domestic product had exceeded an annual rate of 5 percent in the last quarter of 2017, Poland’s inflation slowed in December to 2.0 percent. The central bank’s target is 2.5 percent plus or minus one percentage point. \nGlapinski said prices in Poland were under control because of the effects of globalisation. \nThe zloty currency did not react to the central bank governor’s comments. It was already slightly losing steam this week in anticipation of dovish Glapinski remarks after a short stint of strength last week.
