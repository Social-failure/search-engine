The areas affected included parts of Nairobi, Mount Kenya, Nyanza, Western, Rift Valley and Coast regions, according to the company.\nIt said on Twitter overnight that power had been restored in parts of the capital, though on Twitter on Wednesday morning people still reported outages in some neighborhoods.\nPower was also back on in parts of the Rift Valley and most of the Western and Coast regions, the company said Wednesday.\nThe company is the country’s sole electricity distributor and the bulk of its power comes from Kenya Electricity Generating Company (KenGen).\nKenya Power, which has 6.4 million customers connected to its grid, gets 60 percent of its revenues from industrial consumers in Nairobi and the neighbouring town of Thika.\nWhile the frequency and severity of outages in Kenya has fallen over the years, many firms still run stand-by generators to cope with any interruptions.\nKenya has an installed electricity generating capacity of 2,341 MW, most of it from geothermal and hydroelectric power.
