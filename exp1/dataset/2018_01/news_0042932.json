Much of the money was spent on 138 high-end properties in California and Colorado, operating expenses and at least $21 million on luxury cars and jet charters for Shapiro and his family.\nShapiro has denied the allegations and has not been criminally charged. He resigned from the Sherman Oaks, California-based company on Dec. 1.\nAs part of Tuesday’s deal, the SEC dropped its request for a court-ordered trustee to replace management. On Friday, the company’s chief restructuring officer and independent manager said they were resigning.\n“The staff truly believes the settlement is in the best interest of investors,” said David Baddley, a staff attorney for the SEC.\nWoodbridge agreed to appoint Richard Nevins, Freddie Reiss and Michael Goldberg as its new board.\nThe SEC also agreed to withdraw a request filed with a Miami federal court to appoint a receiver over Woodbridge’s assets.\nU.S. Bankruptcy Judge Kevin Carey in Wilmington said the deal would be less disruptive than appointing a trustee, which is rare in a large bankruptcy.\nWoodbridge also agreed to pay for advisers for two newly formed committees for alleged victims. One committee would represent investors who bought promissory notes issued by seven Woodbridge funds. Another would represent holders of equity in the same seven Woodbridge funds.\nThe two groups of investors are at odds over who should be repaid first. In addition, Woodbridge’s property is divided among scores of legally separate entities, each with differing claims in favor of different groups of investors, complicating the process of unwinding the alleged fraud.
