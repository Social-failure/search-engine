He denied media reports that the SPD would tighten its voting rules. \nIn a similar ballot in 2013, people joining the party less than one month before the SPD clinched a coalition agreement with Merkel’s party were barred from voting on the deal. \nThe process of screening individual applications can take three to four weeks, meaning that the hundreds of Germans joining the SPD since Kuehnert’s appeal might not get to vote on any new coalition deal if it comes before late March.

REUTERS/Wolfgang Rattay JUMP IN APPLICATIONS \nRegional party organisations have reported a jump in SPD membership applications, costing from 5 euros a month, since the weekend. \nIn North Rhine-Westphalia (NRW), Germany’s largest state, the SPD had received 600 new applications, in Berlin, 300 and in Lower Saxony, some 400, though they do not all necessarily come from those sharing Kuehnert’s opposition to a new coalition. \nThe numbers are still small compared with the 30,000 who streamed into the party during 2017 amid the initial euphoria that surrounded Schulz’s appointment as party leader. \nMany in Jusos liken themselves to “Momentum”, a left-wing dissident membership group that has influence in Britain’s opposition Labour Party, securing the election of outsider Jeremy Corbyn as leader over the objections of the then-leadership. \nBut SPD leaders warned against a short-term influx of new members joining with just one purpose in mind. \n“The SPD isn’t eBay,” Michael Groschek, the SPD’s chief in NRW, told newspaper Die Welt. “We don’t put our political decisions up for auction.” Reporting by Thomas Escritt; Editing by Alison Williams and Gareth Jones", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-24T16:37:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-24T16:54:00.002+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
