In Australia, Rio Tinto and BHP, along with Fortescue Metals Group aim to add about 170 million tonnes of new capacity over the next several years.\nThe forecast price decline will continue into 2019, when the steelmaking raw material will average only $49 a tonne, the department said in its latest commodities outlook paper.\n“The iron ore price is expected to experience some ongoing volatility in early 2018, as the market responds to uncertainty regarding the impact of winter production restrictions on iron ore demand,” it warned.\nThe lower prices will reflect growing supply from low-cost producers and moderating demand from China, it said.\nChina is in the process of closing ageing, high-polluting steel mills and induction furnaces to curb overcapacity in the sector.\nChina’s President Xi Jinping said in October that fighting pollution was one of the country’s key tasks through 2020.\nAustralia’s liquefied natural gas (LNG) exports are forecast to climb to 76.5 million tonnes in the year to end-June 2019, from 63 million tonnes forecast for the 2017/18 fiscal year and 52 million tonnes last year.\nBetween 2016/17 and 2018/19, LNG should add A$14 billion ($11 billion) to Australia’s export earnings, while iron ore is forecast to subtract A$10 billion, according to the department.\nThe shift follows the construction of $180 billion of new gas projects. The rise in LNG earnings will be underpinned as three remaining projects under construction hit their stride, it said. These are Chevron Corp’s Wheatstone project, Inpex Corp’s Ichthys and Royal Dutch Shell’s Prelude.\nPrices for coking coal, another key steel-making ingredient, are forecast by the department to drift lower over the next eighteen months from last quarter’s benchmark price of $192 a tonne as rising supply more than offsets demand.\nIt also expects thermal coal prices to ease through 2018 and early 2019, with the Newcastle spot price forecast to drop 12 percent to an average $77 a tonne in 2018, and by a further 6 percent to $70 in 2019.\n($1 = 1.2719 Australian dollars)\nReporting by James Regan; Editing by Christian Schmollinger and Richard Pullin\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-01-08T06:02:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-08T00:23:31.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
