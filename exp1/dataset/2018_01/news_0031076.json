The mine produced just 320,000 tonnes of the metal in the first six months due to a strike that lasted more than 40 days.\nWorkers ultimately returned to work after deciding to extend their old contract, but that means they will return to the negotiating table with the company this year.\nRio Tinto PLC and Japan’s JECO Co Ltd also have stakes in Escondida.
