An online petition is circulating telling Trump he is not welcome. \nOn Saturday, around 500 anti-globalisation protesters marched peacefully past the Swiss parliament in Bern. \nSome were clad in black and carried placards saying “No future for capitalism”, “Eat the rich” and “Kill Trump”, also setting off flares. \nUp to 5,000 Swiss soldiers have been drafted in to guard Davos along with 1,000 police, while a no-fly zone will also be put in place to protect delegates.
