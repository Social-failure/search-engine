Here are his reasons why.\n• The stock is undervalued relative to its peers, with a forward price-earnings ratio of 11.8, according to FactSet data.\n• The company is strong in the cloud, mobile, security and analytics spaces.\n• IBM is expanding its footprint in the growing blockchain market.\nThe stock fell nearly 8 percent last year and the company has seen 22 straight quarters of declining revenue . Still, after its last earnings report in October, the stock surged 9 percent.\nBottom line: Tepper sees IBM as a value at these levels, ahead of the company's earnings report next week.\nDisclosure: Neither Mark Tepper nor his firm owns IBM.\nVote Vote to see results Total Votes: Not a Scientific Survey.
