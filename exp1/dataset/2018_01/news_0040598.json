U.S. special forces troops are on the ground in areas held by the YPG and its allies, although not in Afrin.\nU.S. support for the YPG has infuriated Washington’s NATO ally Turkey, which sees the YPG as a terrorist group and has vowed to crush it.\nKurdish efforts to build their own administration there have also alarmed Damascus, which rejects the idea of autonomy from the central state, and has threatened to crush what Assad called “traitors” to Syria.\nTurkey, long one of Assad’s main opponents, has meanwhile suggested it agreed its assault on Afrin with Russia, the main foreign military backer of Assad.\nReporting By Angus McDowall; Editing by Peter Graff\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-01-26T02:28:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-25T23:04:06.008+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
