Pakistan denies the allegations, saying that Washington has been trying to make it a scapegoat for the failures of its war in Afghanistan.\nIn the meantime, to Pakistan’s annoyance, the United States continues its drone campaign against militants in mountainous border regions bordering Afghanistan where government control is limited.\nSince Trump took office a year ago, these drone strikes have increased, though they are a long way off their peak of 2010.\nPakistan’s Foreign Ministry on Thursday reiterated its position that “unilateral actions are detrimental to the spirit of cooperation between the two countries in the fight against terrorism”.\nThe army said the strike had not eliminated any “organized terrorist sanctuary” but “struck individual target who had morphed into Afghan refugees”, without specifying who exactly it believed had been hit.\nThe army said 43 of Pakistan’s 54 Afghan refugee camps were in the northwest, and that it was essential that their inhabitants be repatriated. It said the incident vindicated Pakistan’s stance that the militants could easily blend in with the refugees.\nPakistan is home to nearly 2 million registered Afghan refugees and another 1 million unregistered ones, displaced by decades of war in their country.\nReporting by Asif Shahzad; Editing by Kevin Liffey\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-25T20:06:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-25T20:23:29.004+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
