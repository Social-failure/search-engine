REUTERS/Dondi Tawatao \n“Our petition raises legal issues that have far-reaching implications on business and press freedom,” Lim said, adding the SEC decision “has a chilling effect on business” and could be disastrous to government efforts to attract foreign capital. \nThe online news platform said no foreigner had exercised control, whether direct or indirect, over it, adding that the SEC had violated its own rules by denying Rappler due process. \nRappler said it was not informed about the decision by a special investigation panel of the regulator and was surprised by the January 11 decision revoking its licence. \nSEC head Teresita Herbosa welcomed Rappler’s court challenge. “It’s their right,” she said in a text to Reuters. \nA U.N. rapporteur and journalists’ groups in the Philippines and abroad have expressed concern over the SEC’s decision, calling it an assault on the freedom of the press. \nDuterte’s spokesman Harry Roque said the issue was distant from questions about press freedom, as Rappler used “deceptive schemes” to raise funds. He also denied any political pressure on the SEC to target the president’s critics. \nRappler has repeatedly drawn the ire of Duterte, who called it a “fake news outlet” after it said his closest aide, Bong Go, had intervened in a naval frigate project.
