Randall Matthew Lorayes via REUTERS \nSolidum said the agency had recorded increased seismic activity and “lava fountaining and a summit explosion” from Sunday night, indicating more explosions ahead, including a hazardous eruption. \nA level 5 alert signifies a hazardous eruption is underway. \nAlbay province has run out of emergency funds and more people would be evacuated once government financial help arrived, said provincial governor Al Francis Bichara. \nHe ordered schools to suspend classes, amid ash fall warnings following the explosion at the volcano. \n“In some areas...it’s already zero visibility, especially along the foot of the volcano,” he told CNN Philippines, adding that strong winds could carry ash to distant towns. \n“(People) have to stay home and if they intend to get out of their houses, they have to wear masks,” Bichara said.
