The funding, made under the EU’s programme for poorer EU regions, was meant for small business and Babis’s Agrofert would not qualify. It was however owned by Agrofert entities earlier and is now owned by Agrofert again. \nBabis has been charged with subsidy fraud in the case but won parliamentary immunity in the election. The lower house is expected to vote on lifting his immunity in the coming weeks. \nThe EU’s OLAF has completed its investigation of the case and sent recommendations to the Czech authorities. The report has not been released so far, with a Czech state attorney saying it could impede investigation. \nIt is up to regional Czech authorities to decide on the European Commission and the Finance Ministry recommendation. Officials there were not immediately available for comment.
