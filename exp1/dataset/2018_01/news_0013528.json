Earlier, it had been slightly lower. \n* The energy group climbed 0.7 percent, with Crescent Point Energy Corp rising 4.1 percent to C$10.90 as analysts at two banks increased their price targets on the stock following the release of the company’s 2018 budget. \n* Oil prices hit fresh multi-year highs as OPEC-led production cuts and healthy demand helped to balance the market, but analysts warned of possible overheating. \n* The materials group, which includes precious and base metals miners and fertilizer companies, added 0.7 percent. Those gains were led by gold miners boosting by higher bullion prices. \n* Gold futures rose 0.7 percent to $1,320.7 an ounce, as a report that Chinese officials had recommended slowing or halting U.S. Treasury purchases sparked a broad-based sell-off of the dollar, lifting assets priced in the U.S. currency. \n* The financials group gained 0.2 percent, with Manulife Financial Corp up 0.9 percent at C$26.89. \n* The energy, materials and financials groups combine to account for roughly two-thirds of the index’s weight.
