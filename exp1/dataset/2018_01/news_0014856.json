It reports full figures for the first quarter of its 2017/18 financial year on Feb. 13.\nMetro, which runs wholesale stores in 35 countries as well as struggling Real hypermarkets in Germany, reported sales up 0.2 percent to 10.1 billion euros ($12.3 billion), just below a Thomson Reuters Eikon analyst consensus for 10.2 billion.\nOverall, like-for-like sales were up 0.8 percent, despite a reduced number of trading days in the quarter, versus the company’s full-year forecast to “slightly surpass” the 0.5 percent growth of the previous year.\nChief Executive Olaf Koch said the figures were in line with its full-year outlook, which also foresees headline sales growth of at least the 1.1 percent achieved in 2016/17.\nThe wholesale business in Germany saw a like-for-like rise of about 2 percent, but a 9 percent fall in Russia, while Real reported flat like-for-like sales after nine of its 281 stores were renovated with a bigger focus on fresh and organic food.\nThe delivery business of the wholesale unit continued to grow, Metro said, as did Real ecommerce sales.\n$1 = 0.8187 euros Editing Douglas Busvine and Mark Potter\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-01-15T14:56:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-16T13:39:08.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
