This fluctuation will have the effect of adding to or subtracting from the Fund's overdistributed net investment income balance. Fund management analyzes the current and projected net earning rates prior to recommending dividend amounts to the Fund's Board of Trustees for declaration. There can be no assurance that the monthly dividend rate will remain at its current level or that the undistributed net investment income balance, if any, will be sufficient to cover any shortfall in earnings to meet the current dividend rate. The overdistributed net investment income balance is exclusive of market premium amortization on corporate bonds in accordance with federal income tax treatment. The overdistributed net investment income balance includes realized gain (loss) on the sale of contingent debt and Section 305 sales adjustments for accrual of deemed dividends from investments in convertible debt in accordance with federal income tax treatment.\n(c) Net Investment Income for the fiscal quarter and nine months ended November 30, 2017 includes market premium amortization on corporate bonds of $392,404 ($0.01 per common share) and $1,206,347 ($0.02 per common share), respectively. Net Investment Income for the fiscal quarter and nine months ended November 30, 2016 includes market premium amortization on corporate bonds of $579,760 ($0.01 per common share) and $1,645,708 ($0.02 per common share), respectively. For tax purposes, the Fund has elected not to amortize market premium on corporate bonds.\nAllianz Global Investors U.S. LLC an indirect, wholly-owned subsidiary of Allianz Asset Management of America L.P., serves as the Fund's investment manager and is a member of Munich-based Allianz Group.\nThe Fund's daily New York Stock Exchange closing market price, NAV, as well as other information, are available at us.allianzgi.com/en-us/advisors/products-solutions/closed-end-funds or by calling the Fund's shareholder servicing agent at (800) 254-5197.\nThe financial information contained herein is solely based upon the data available at the time of publication of this press release, and there is no assurance that any future results will be the same or similar to the results reported herein.
