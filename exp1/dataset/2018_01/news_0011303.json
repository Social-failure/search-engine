Dozens of people were killed in several bouts of violence between ethnic Oromos and Somalis in the Oromiya region last year. \nHailemariam made his announcement after the ruling EPRDF coalition concluded a weeks-long meeting meant to thrash out policies to address grievances. \nThe unrest had triggered growing friction within the party. Some high-ranking members had subsequently submitted their resignation, while officials have openly squabbled with each other over the cause of clashes. \nGetachew said more pardons and releases are set to follow. \nEthiopia, sandwiched between volatile Somalia and Sudan, is often accused by rights groups of using security concerns as an excuse to stifle dissent and media freedoms. It denies the charge. Reporting by Aaron Maasho; Editing by", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-16T03:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-16T22:50:52.007+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
