Although the Tesla was traveling at 65 mph, “Amazingly there were no injuries!” the fire fighters said in a tweet. \nEngine 42, which had been responding to a motorcycle accident, was parked in the left shoulder and carpool lane on Interstate 405 with a CHP vehicle parked nearby, Culver City Fire Department battalion chief Ken Powell told The San Jose Mercury News . Lights on the vehicles were also flashing. \nIn a statement to Fortune , Tesla said, “Autopilot is intended for use only with a fully attentive driver.” While working a freeway accident this morning, Engine 42 was struck by a #Tesla traveling at 65 mph. The driver reports the vehicle was on autopilot. Amazingly there were no injuries!

Instead, they have an “advanced driver assistance system” that is for only certain conditions, Bloomberg notes, and drivers must always remain alert. \nU.S. National Transportation Safety Board is looking into the crash, according to Bloomberg , but the board is unsure if it will open a formal inquiry.

In 2016, a Tesla Model S on “autopilot” was in use during a fatal crash in Florida. The NTSB partially faulted Tesla’s “autopilot.” Since then, Tesla has also updated its “autopilot” system .
