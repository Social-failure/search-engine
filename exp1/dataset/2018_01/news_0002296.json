LOUIS--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- As progress continues for the merger with Bayer, Monsanto Company (NYSE: MON) announced strong results for the first quarter of its fiscal year 2018, growing as-reported earnings per share (EPS) to $0.38. Early indicators from the first three months, such as volume and pricing growth for INTACTA RR2 PRO TM soybeans in South America, improved pricing in glyphosate and more than $85 million in gains from asset sales, signal that the company is well positioned to deliver on its business goals.\nLikewise, in its annual Research & Development (R&D) pipeline showcase today, Monsanto highlighted how new technologies will help growers combat threats in the field and optimize opportunities with less land, energy and water. This marks the fifth consecutive year of more than 20 research projects advancing. The company released information on the R&D showcase in a separate announcement this morning.\nFirst Quarter ($ in millions, except per share amounts) 2018 2017 Net Sales by Segment Corn seed and traits $ 787 $ 949 Soybean seed and traits 728 600 Cotton seed and traits 120 116 Vegetable seeds 114 131 All other crops seeds and traits 21 52 TOTAL Seeds and Genomics $ 1,770 $ 1,848 Agricultural productivity $ 888 $ 802 TOTAL Agricultural Productivity $ 888 $ 802 TOTAL Net Sales $ 2,658 $ 2,650 Gross Profit $ 1,312 $ 1,259 Operating Expenses $ 1,070 $ 1,012 Interest Expense – Net $ 109 $ 118 Other (Income) Expense– Net $ (97 ) $ 43 Net Income Attributable to Monsanto Company $ 169 $ 29 Diluted Earnings per Share $ 0.38 $ 0.07 Items Affecting Comparability – EPS Impact (For definitions of adjustments to EPS, see note 1.)

We’re excited and energized about the new areas of scientific advancement we expect to unlock by combining with Bayer, to allow us to bring more products to farmers faster.\"\nResults of Operations\nFor the fiscal year 2018 first quarter, net sales were nearly flat compared to the prior year’s first quarter at $2.7 billion. Gross profit for the quarter grew slightly, to $1.3 billion. More than $85 million in gains from asset sales were recorded in the first quarter, the most significant being the sale of Precision Planting to AGCO.\nSelling, general and administrative costs were $664 million, and research and development expenses were $382 million for the first quarter of fiscal year 2018. Total selling, general and administrative costs and research and development expenses increased, mostly due to higher commissions, point-of-delivery costs and bad debt expense associated with the growth in South America, as well as from inflationary increases and increased spend on R&D.\nThe company’s fiscal year 2018 first quarter EPS on an as-reported basis was $0.38, as compared to $0.07 in the prior year. EPS on an ongoing basis was $0.41, well above the prior year’s $0.21, driven by the strong start to the business in South America. (For a reconciliation of as-reported EPS to ongoing EPS, see note 1).\nCash Flow\nFor the first three months of fiscal year 2018, net cash provided by operating activities was $1.3 billion, compared with net cash provided by operating activities of $1.5 billion in the first three months of last year. Net cash required by investing activities for the first three months of fiscal year 2018 was $210 million, compared to $327 million for the same period of fiscal year 2017. Net cash provided by financing activities for the first three months of fiscal year 2018 was $178 million, compared to net cash required of $655 million for the same period of fiscal year 2017. Free cash flow was down for the first quarter of fiscal year 2018, at $874 million compared to $1.1 billion in the first three months of the prior year. (NOTE: free cash flow metric reflects the company’s definition of free cash flow, which is operating cash flows less capital expenditures. For a reconciliation of free cash flow, see note 1.)\nFiscal Year 2018 Outlook\nThe company expects growth in its pretax income for fiscal year 2018, but did not provide specific financial guidance in light of the pending combination with Bayer. The expected growth drivers for Monsanto’s business are continued improvements in pricing for glyphosate, plus the adoption of new technologies in Seeds and Genomics such as INTACTA RR2 PRO TM soybeans, Roundup Ready 2 Xtend ® soybeans, Bollgard ® II XtendFlex ® cotton, and new corn hybrids around the world. Gains from recent asset sales are also contributing to growth. The company will remain disciplined as it monitors the evolution of U.S. corn and soybean plantings through the spring.\nFor Agricultural Productivity, volumes of XtendiMax ® Herbicide with VaporGrip ® Technology are expected to expand as acreage grows. The company continues to invest in the construction of its dicamba manufacturing plant in Luling, La., slated for completion in 2020.\nAs communicated previously, the company expects to complete its restructuring and cost savings initiative that began in fiscal year 2015, with the expectation that selling, general and administrative costs and research and development expenses in fiscal year 2018 will be down slightly year over year. Once the initiative is completed, the company expects to re", "external_links": ["http://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=https%3A%2F%2Fservices.choruscall.com%2Flinks%2Fmon180104B4Fan3Fi.html&esheet=51737649&newsitemid=20180104005636&lan=en-US&anchor=https%3A%2F%2Fservices.choruscall.com%2Flinks%2Fmon180104B4Fan3Fi.html&index=2&md5=f237f0f8a4787b2754ff2693325e6b60", "https://monsanto.com/investors/reports", "http://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.twitter.com%2FMonsantoCo&esheet=51737649&newsitemid=20180104005636&lan=en-US&anchor=twitter.com%2FMonsantoCo&index=4&md5=2fd02de74ae3b0d6904dc4c0cc3c9e9a", "http://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=https%3A%2F%2Fmonsanto.com%2Finvestors%2Freports&esheet=51737649&newsitemid=20180104005636&lan=en-US&anchor=https%3A%2F%2Fmonsanto.com%2Finvestors%2Freports&index=1&md5=1ce86606fa9fe40e7ef84132d8290e3c", "http://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.monsanto.com%2F&esheet=51737649&newsitemid=20180104005636&lan=en-US&anchor=monsanto.com&index=3&md5=9d1324986a210c19c61907e87c87316b", "http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180104005636/en/", "https://services.choruscall.com/links/mon180104B4Fan3Fi.html"], "published": "2018-01-04T16:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-04T16:35:18.027+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
