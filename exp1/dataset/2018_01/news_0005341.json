If we start in a good position, it will be no problem, I think.” \nIn the motorcycle category, Britain’s defending champion Sam Sunderland lost the lead to Honda’s Spanish rider Joan Barreda and fell to fourth overall. \nBarreda leads French Yamaha rider Adrien van Beveren by two-and-a-half minutes. \nMonday’s 296-km third stage is south from Pisco to the coastal town of San Juan de Marcona.
