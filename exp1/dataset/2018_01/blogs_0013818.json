He remained mum on any future merger deals for the company. \n\"What we have publically said is we have concerns with AT&T and Time Warner,\" he said. \nStill, Dish is welcoming the competition as more companies like YouTube and Hulu start offering over-the-top (OTT) pay TV services, Carlson said. Dish's main OTT play is its Sling TV service, which some have said cannibalizes its satellite subscriptions. Carlson brushed off those concerns, saying Sling TV is \"progressing along nicely.\" \n\"One way to look at it is if the rising tide [of over-the-top subscriptions] will lift all boats,\" Carlson said. \"But our focus is really on the Sling TV business and providing a differentiated experience for customers so that the product and service that customers want are at a value that they're willing to pay for.\" \n- Additional reporting by Julia Boorstin \nNote: CNBC parent company NBCUniversal is co-owner of Hulu.
