However, that trend is changing and in recent years same-sex couples have been allowed to marry in Argentina, Brazil, Colombia, Uruguay and some parts of Mexico, despite church opposition. \nThe Inter-American Court, based in Costa Rica’s capital San Jose, said the countries that it oversees should treat same-sex couples “without discrimination,” ensuring that they receive the same family and financial rights as heterosexual couples. \nIt also recommended that these rights be ensured through temporary decrees while governments pursue permanent laws. \nCosta Rica’s government celebrated the decision, saying that lawmakers would take steps to adopt the court’s criteria “in its totality.” \n“The court ... reminds all states on the continent, including ours, of their obligation and historical debt toward this population,” Costa Rica’s vice president Ana Helena Chacon said at a press conference.
