Discounts of more than 10 percent of a vehicle's sticker price can hurt resale values, in turn weighing on new vehicle sales. In December, auto consultancies J.D. Power and LMC estimated discounts had topped 10 percent for the 17th time in the last 18 months.\nMark Wakefield, global co-head of automotive and industrial consulting at consultancy AlixPartners LLP - which expects U.S. industry sales to drop to 16.6 million in 2018 - said so far high discounts have not hurt automakers too much, but pricing discipline is a real concern moving forward.\n\"What we're really nervous about is if someone defects and adds $1,000 to the hood... and forces others to respond to protect market share,\" Wakefield said.\nGM reported a 3.3 percent drop in sales in December, driven by a decline in lower-margin fleet sales to government agencies and rental car companies. GM's retail sales were up 1.8 percent.\nThe automaker said its average transaction price hit $35,400 in 2017, above the industry average of $31,600.\nFord reported a 0.9 percent increase in sales for December, fueled by a 17 percent increase in fleet sales. The No. 2 U.S. automaker said its retail sales were down 4 percent.\nIn afternoon trading, GM shares were up 2.4 percent, Ford shares were up 1 percent and Fiat Chrysler was up 2.8 percent.\nFiat Chrysler posted an 11 percent sales decrease, with retail sales dropping 3 percent. Fleet sales slumped 42 percent, in line with a company strategy over the last year to cut back on this low-margin way to unload product.\nToyota Motor Corp said its sales fell 8.3 percent in December, with decreases across all segments.\nHonda Motor Co Ltd posted a 7 percent drop in sales in December, driven mostly by declining passenger car sales.\nNissan Motor Co Ltd reported a 9.5 percent drop in sales.
