Reach her on Messenger to share your thoughts on market moves: helen.reid.thomsonreuters.com@reuters.net Closing snapshot: European shares end slightly lower Though strength in commodities-related sectors did help stem losses. That's it for today folks, see you tomorrow for more on European equity markets, with all eyes on MiFID. We'll leave you with a closing snapshot: (Kit Rees) ** Miners pull European stocks off lows heading into close (1602 GMT) This is thanks to a turnaround among basic resources stocks, which are now in positive territory with steel makers such as ArcelorMittal, Tenaris and Voestalpine among the biggest mining gainers. Likewise energy stocks are positive while banks are flat, so we're seeing a helping hand from the cyclical cohort. (Kit Rees) Portuguese shares post mysterious outperformance (1554 GMT) Portugal's blue-chip index is set for a stellar outperformance in comparison to its European peers, rising 1.4 percent while the STOXX 600 is losing 0.2 percent. But we don't know why. \"I really can't see a single explanation to explain this\", a Parisian asset manager told us, saying current tailwinds for energy and financial stocks could be among the positive factors lifting the PSI 20. Another possible explanation would be a very large investor going overweight on the country. A trader in Lisbon also said he couldn't see any specific piece of news to justify today's move. You can see Portugal's outperformance here: tmsnrt.rs/2CCu1yI (Julien Ponthus) ** Bond market jitters a worry for stocks? (1505 GMT) Bond yields across the euro zone have shot up today after hawkish comments from a central banker spread fear among investors that the end of the ECB's stimulus programme could come earlier than expected. Part of today's stock market weakness could be down to a contagion effect from the bond sell-off as yields on German Bunds, the regional benchmark, hit a two-month high. \"The irrational exuberance supporting bond markets is over and equity markets will likely experience a long overdue correction in the path to a higher interest rate environment,\" says Christopher Peel, CIO at Tavistock Wealth. \"This is the start of a longer-term portfolio rotation that reduces bond duration and increases equity exposure, especially Smart Beta strategies.\" Investors are likely to stay favourable to stocks as long as their yield remains relatively more attractive, and Peel reckons bond yields will have to rise by at least 100 basis points for that relative advantage to disappear. He sees it as more of an issue for stocks in 2019.

Equity funds came in second place, with more than 7 billion euros' worth of inflows. Overall net inflows into European mutual funds stood at nearly 29 billion euros for November. (Kit Rees) ** U.S. stock futures up - but does the first day of trading matter? (1300 GMT) Futures for the S&P 500, Nasdaq and Dow Jones are all trading higher ahead of the Wall Street open, pointing to a strong start to 2018 for U.S. stocks, which had a stellar 2017. Some analysts say the direction on the first day of trading is actually a good predictor of how well stocks will do in the 12 subsequent months. Here's some number-crunching courtesy of Ryan Detrick, senior market analyst at LPL Financial: We checked whether we could find a similar trend for the STOXX 600 and the answer is no, not really. Since 2008, three years yielded negative returns (2008, 2011 and 2016). The year started badly in 2008 and 2016 but not in 2011. Of the 7 years when shares finished higher, two had a negative start (2014 and 2015). It's probably safe not to read much into day one. (Helen Reid and Julien Ponthus) ** Something \"naysayers\" forget about the U.S. yield curve (1220 GMT) Investors who worry that the flattening of the U.S. yield curve signals the upcoming end of the bull market forget one thing, SocGen's Alvin Tan writes. \"Naysayers might point to the flattening U.S. yield curve, but in the past two episodes (1998 and 2005) when the yield curve flattened to zero, the S&P500 index continued to climb for well over a year\", he notes. (Julien Ponthus) ** MiFID II- \"Peppercorn prices are unacceptable,\" research platform says (1157 GMT) \"MiFID II has arrived and action must be taken,\" writes Russell Napier, co-founder of research marketplace ERIC. He worries that a number of investments banks are conducting a \"research price war\" in a bid to woo clients. \"Devaluing (research) could harm the end investor, in direct contrast with MiFID II's ultimate aim\", he adds. Have a look at Reuters' latest stories on MiFID II, which comes into force tomorrow: (Julien Ponthus) ** More pressure in store for European retailers - Deutsche Bank (1141 GMT) There's a big focus on retail in notes this morning, with the big UK retailers Kit just mentioned due to report next week. Weighing in on non-food retailers, Deutsche Bank analysts say macro conditions will continue to be pretty unhelpful and performance will be largely determined by structural changes in a disrupted industry. Here are five investment tips and themes DB suggests to navigate this: 1) Buy the value retailers DB's top picks are AB Foods, B&M and Boohoo which could all benefit from consumers shifting to cheaper stores 2) Watch the value traps in mid-market apparel retail M&S, Next and Debenhams should be avoided despite low valuation multiples, DB reckons, though it sees a \"slightly better\" year for them in 2018 3) Back online brands over the platforms DB prefers ASOS and Boohoo over Showroomprive and Zalando, saying the UK online fashion starlets are more differentiated and can drive stronger growth 4) Be sceptical of transformation stories It's a difficult backdrop for successful turnarounds in the sector and DB downgrades Carpetright for that reason 5) Buy travel companies at the right price Airport retailers such as Dufry and WH Smith could benefit from increasing airport traffic boosting their captive consumer base (Helen Reid) ** X-mas: analysts watching UK \"Big Four\" supermarkets vs. discounters (1131 GMT) Following the Christmas period, it looks like there's a lot of interest in retailers - UBS analysts are weighing in with their thoughts on UK grocers, which have been feeling the heat from the discounters as well as an inflation-pressured consumer. \"With UK disposable income squeezed, Christmas trading could be a bellwether for down-trading in 2018,\" UBS analysts say in a note. \"But th", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-02T08:32:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-02T08:57:05.058+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
