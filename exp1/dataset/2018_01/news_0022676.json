Forecasts at the end of last week had seen cold weather fronts on the cards much sooner, which had beefed up spot prices for Monday.\n* Temperatures will now turn lower next week, with Germany’s seen falling by 2.4 degrees Celsius on average from the 4.4 degrees predicted for Tuesday, according to Thomson Reuters data.\n* It also showed French temperatures down at a likely 5.8 degrees next week, compared with 9.2 degrees expected for Tuesday.\n* The German baseload electricity contract for the week starting Jan. 22 rose 16.5 percent to 38.45 euros ($47.18) while its French equivalent increased by 11.6 percent to 43.25 euros.\n* Day-ahead prices in both countries fell sharply on more wind supply.\n* Wind power generation in Germany is forecast to reach 25 GW on Tuesday, up 3 GW day-to-day and equivalent to half the total capacity.\n* French nuclear capacity usage is currently steady at 91.6 percent of the available total.\n* Further ahead, Germany’s Cal ‘19 baseload contract dropped to a five-week low of just under 35 euros, down 1.1 percent from Friday and the lowest since Dec. 7.\n* Its less liquid French counterpart was off 1.3 percent at 40.45 euros, the lowest since Nov. 20.\n* December 2018 expiry carbon emissions permits lost 1 percent to 7.78 euros a tonne.\n* Traders said energy sector plans within the agenda for Germany’s coalition talks, published since Friday, while including a higher renewable power quota by 2030, have delayed previously more aggressive CO2 cutting targets for 2020.\n* “The view is this probably spares the coal sector plant closures, which could have come much sooner,” one said, adding 2020 and 2021 prices also came down. A commission will nevertheless have to come up with plans by the end of this year on how to prepare a long-term exit from coal generation.\n* In eastern Europe, Czech Tuesday baseload power was down 1.25 euros at 33.75 eurs/MWh.
