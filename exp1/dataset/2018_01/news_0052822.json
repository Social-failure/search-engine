(the “Company” or \"Blue Hills Bancorp\") (NASDAQ:BHBK), the parent of Blue Hills Bank (the \"Bank\"), today announced net income of $1.3 million, or $0.05 per diluted share, for the fourth quarter of 2017 compared to net income of $3.8 million, or $0.16 per diluted share, for the third quarter of 2017 and net income of $4.0 million, or $0.17 per diluted share, for the fourth quarter of 2016.\nThe fourth quarter of 2017 included an additional income tax expense of approximately $2.5 million, or $0.10 per diluted share, related to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “Tax Act”) which was enacted on December 22, 2017. The Tax Act provides for a reduction in the corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21% effective January 1, 2018 and this reduction in the corporate tax rate resulted in a downward revaluation to the Company's net deferred tax asset (DTA). The fourth quarter of 2017 also included a pre-tax charge of $317,000 ($188,000 after tax, or $0.01 per share) related to pension settlements. The third quarter of 2017 included a pre-tax loss of $118,000 ($73,000 after tax, or less than a penny per diluted share) from the sale of a purchased home equity loan portfolio. Excluding these items, net income was $4.0 million, or $0.16 per share, for the fourth quarter of 2017 on a non-GAAP basis and $3.9 million, or $0.16 per share for the third quarter of 2017 on a non-GAAP basis (see pages 15 and 16 for a reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP measures).\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017, net income was $16.5 million, or $0.67 per diluted share. Excluding nonrecurring items, net income for the year ended December 31, 2017 on a non-GAAP basis was $13.8 million or $0.56 per share. For the year ended December 31, 2016, net income was $8.7 million or $0.35 per diluted share.\n2017 HIGHLIGHTS\nRevenue growth and expense discipline allowed the Company to generate strong operating leverage in 2017 which, in turn, resulted in improvements to the efficiency ratio and return on assets compared to 2016 (see page 18). Loans grew 14% to $2.2 billion at December 31, 2017 from the end of 2016. Over the past three years, loans have increased $1.1 billion, or 93%, as the Company continued to execute on its balance sheet diversification strategy through an expansion of the residential mortgage, commercial real estate and commercial business loan portfolios. Since the end of 2014, commercial real estate loans are up 116%, 1-4 family residential mortgages have increased 101% and commercial business loans have grown 67%. Mortgage banking capabilities have been expanded over the past few years, including the opening of several new loan offices in Eastern Massachusetts. Current plans call for opening additional offices in Marblehead and Dorchester during the first quarter of 2018. Mortgage banking income grew to $3.7 million in 2017, up $1.2 million, or 48%, from 2016. Mortgage banking revenue was just $282,000 in 2015. Mortgage originations have been strong the past two years, totaling $495 million in 2017 and $539 million in 2016 compared to $269 million in 2015. Commercial loan originations (real estate and non-real estate combined) were $412 million in 2017 compared to $359 million in 2016 and $331 million in 2015. The Company has continued to expand its asset-based lending and specialized lending businesses as well as its commercial deposit taking capabilities, including converting to a new cash management platform. The combination of commercial and small business deposits totaled $359 million at December 31, 2017, up 20% from the end of 2016 and up 65% from the end of 2015. Over the past few years, new retail branches were opened in Milton (fourth quarter of 2014), Westwood (fourth quarter of 2015), and the Seaport District of Boston (fourth quarter of 2016). These three branches had combined total deposits of $266 million at December 31, 2017. Deposits, excluding brokered deposits, increased 13% during 2017. The Government Banking division has added to the growth in deposits over the past two years, as municipal deposits were $137 million at the end of 2017, up 32% from the end of 2016 and up 188% from the end of 2015. During 2017, the Company completed the process of restructuring its securities portfolio by selling its mutual fund and corporate bond portfolios. The remaining portfolio was moved in-house saving annual investment management fees of approximately $400,000. Net interest margin has improved over the last several quarters as the Company has benefited from maintaining an asset sensitive interest rate risk position while the Federal Reserve has been raising interest rates. Capital deployment efforts continued as the Company has reduced its tangible common equity to tangible assets ratio to 14.6% at December 31, 2017 from 23.7% at September 30, 2014 (the Company's first quarter as a public company). During 2017, the Company paid a $0.20 per share special dividend and raised its regular quarterly dividend twice. The quarterly dividend is now $0.15 per share compared to $0.03 at the end of 2016. Credit quality was strong throughout 2017 and the Company had net loan recoveries of $29,000 during the year. The Company and its foundations made donations in excess of $1 million in each of the last four years to various nonprofits reflecting the Company's active involvement in the communities it serves. Most of the donations were made through the Blue Hills Bank charitable foundations which support non-profits in the fields of education and the arts, health and human services, affordable housing, financial literacy, and community services.\nCommenting on the Company's results, William Parent, President and Chief Executive Officer of Blue Hills Bancorp, said, \"We are very proud of the progress we have made since becoming a public company in the third quarter of 2014. Our investment spending over the past few years has allowed us to build out our retail, mortgage and commercial banking platforms while adding experienced and dedicated employees who have led the effort in improving our financial performance and customer experience. These efforts have resulted in significant improvement in earnings growth, operating leverage, revenue, return on assets and operating efficiency; however, we recognize that our work is far from done and we look forward to another year of progress in 2018.\"\nBALANCE SHEET\nCompared to September 30, 2017, total assets grew $123 million, or 5%, to $2.7 billion at December 31, 2017. The increase was mainly driven by a $119 million, or 6%, increase in loans to $2.2 billion at December 31, 2017. By category, commercial real estate loans increased $83 million, residential mortgage loans were up $21 million and commercial business loans grew $12 million.\nCompared to December 31, 2016, total assets increased $199 million, or 8%. Loans also drove the growth in total assets in this comparison, increasing $275 million, or 14%. By category, the increase from December 31, 2016 was due to commercial real estate loans, which were up $147 million, or 22%; residential mortgage loans, which were up $72 million, or 8%; and commercial business loans, which were up $47 million, or 23%. Residential mortgage loan originations were $112 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 compared to $176 million in the fourth quarter of 2016 while commercial loans (real estate and non-real estate combined) added to the balance sheet were $156 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 compared to $93 million in the fourth quarter of 2016. The growth in loans from December 31, 2016 was partially offset by a $92 million, or 23%, decline in the combination of securities available for sale and held to maturity, primarily due to the sales of the mutual fund investment portfolio and the remaining available-for-sale corporate debt securities portfolio in the first half of 2017.\nCompared to September 30, 2017, deposits grew $54 million, or 3%, to $2.0 billion at December 31, 2017. The growth from the end of the third quarter was driven by a $66 million increase in brokered deposits and a $10 million increase in deposits at the Seaport branch, partially offset by a seasonal decline of $33 million in deposits at the Nantucket Bank. Borrowings increased to $205 million at December 31, 2017 from $130 million at September 30, 2017.\nCompared to December 31, 2016, deposits grew $231 million, or 13%, and included growth in all customer segments (consumer, small business, commercial and municipal). By category, the most significant increases were seen in certificates of deposit, which were up $108 million, money market deposits, which were up $73 million, and NOW and demand deposits, which were up $50 million. The growth in CDs lengthened the duration of customer deposits. These increases were partially offset by a $42 million decline in regular savings deposits. Nantucket Bank deposits increased $24 million from the end of 2016. Total brokered deposits increased $42 million from the end of 2016 while borrowings declined $46 million.\nStockholders’ equity was $398 million at December 31, 2017 compared to $399 million at September 30, 2017 and $387 million at December 31, 2016. The increase from a year ago included net income during 2017, which added $16 million to stockholders' equity and the payment of $14 million in dividends, including a special dividend of $0.20 per common share in the second quarter of 2017. There were no share repurchases in 2017.\nNET INTEREST AND DIVIDEND INCOME\nReported net interest and dividend income was $17.8 million in the fourth quarter of 2017, up $840,000, or 5%, from $17.0 million in the third quarter of 2017 and up $1.8 million, or 12%, from $16.0 million in the fourth quarter of 2016. Reported net interest margin was 2.80% in the fourth quarter of 2017, up from 2.77% in the third quarter of 2017 but down from 2.81% in the fourth quarter of 2016.\nNet interest and dividend income on a fully taxable equivalent basis (referred to herein as \"Reported net interest and dividend income (FTE)\", a Non-GAAP measure) was $17.9 million in the fourth quarter of 2017, up $846,000, or 5%, from $17.0 million in the third quarter of 2017, and up $1.8 million, or 11%, from $16.0 million in the fourth quarter of 2016. Net interest margin on a fully taxable equivalent basis (referred to herein as \"Reported net interest margin (FTE)\", a Non-GAAP measure) was 2.81% in the fourth quarter of 2017 compared to 2.78% in the third quarter of 2017 and 2.82% in the fourth quarter of 2016.\nThe table shown below provides a reconciliation of reported to adjusted net interest and dividend income and margin for the last five quarters (referred to herein as \"adjusted net interest and dividend income (FTE)\" and \"adjusted net interest margin (FTE)\", which are Non-GAAP measures). Commentary which follows the table focuses on changes in adjusted net interest and dividend income (FTE) and adjusted net interest margin (FTE).\n(Unaudited, dollars in thousands) December 31, 2017 September 30, 2017 June 30, 2017 March 31, 2017 December 31, 2016 Net Interest and Dividend Income Reported net interest and dividend income $ 17,794 $ 16,954 $ 16,408 $ 15,881 $ 15,950 FTE adjustment 64 58 60 66 78 Reported net interest and dividend income (FTE) 17,858 17,012 16,468 15,947 16,028 Mutual fund dividends (1) — — — — (844 ) Purchase accounting accretion (1) (100 ) (103 ) (181 ) (107 ) (137 ) Adjusted net interest and dividend income (FTE) (2) $ 17,758 $ 16,909 $ 16,287 $ 15,840 $ 15,047 Net Interest Margin Reported net interest margin 2.80 % 2.77 % 2.75 % 2.70 % 2.81 % FTE adjustment 0.01 0.01 0.01 0.01 0.01 Reported net interest margin (FTE) 2.81 2.78 2.76 2.71 2.82 Mutual fund dividends (1) — — — 0.03 (0.10 ) Purchase accounting accretion (1) (0.02 ) (0.02 ) (0.03 ) (0.02 ) (0.03 ) Adjusted net interest margin (FTE) (2) 2.79 % 2.76 % 2.73 % 2.72 % 2.69 % (1) In calculating the net interest margin impact of mutual fund dividends and purchase accounting accretion, average earning assets were adjusted to remove the average balances associated with each item. In the first quarter of 2017 when the mutual fund dividend income was zero, the removal of the average balance had a positive impact on the adjusted net interest margin. Management believes this adjusted net interest margin is useful to investors because of the volatility or non-recurring nature of certain items from quarter to quarter. The Company sold its investments in mutual funds during the first quarter of 2017.\n(2) Management believes that it is a standard practice in the banking industry to present net interest margin and net interest income on a fully taxable equivalent basis (FTE), using a federal statutory tax rate of 35%. Therefore, management believes, these measures provide useful information to investors by allowing them to make peer comparisons. Adjusted net interest and dividend income (FTE) increased $849,000, or 5%, to $17.8 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 from $16.9 million in the third quarter of 2017 and was up $2.7 million, or 18%, from $15.0 million in the fourth quarter of 2016. Adjusted net interest margin (FTE) improved to 2.79% in the fourth quarter of 2017 from 2.76% in the third quarter of 2017 and 2.69% in the fourth quarter of 2016. Adjusted net interest and dividend income (FTE) and adjusted net interest margin (FTE) benefited in both comparisons from higher floating rate loan yields related to the interest rate increases announced by the Federal Reserve Bank in June 2017, March 2017, December 2016 and, to a lesser extent, the rate hike that was announced in December 2017. The Company maintains an asset sensitive interest rate risk position. In addition, adjusted net interest and dividend income (FTE) was helped by loan growth, as average loans increased $82 million, or 4%, from the third quarter of this year and $355 million, or 19%, from the fourth quarter of last year. The increases in both comparisons were mainly driven by higher levels of commercial real estate loans, residential mortgages, and commercial business loans. Partially offsetting the improvement in adjusted net interest and dividend income (FTE) from the fourth quarter of 2016, was a $96 million, or 24%, decline in average securities reflecting the sales of the mutual fund and remaining available for sale corporate debt securities portfolios in the first half of 2017.\nNONINTEREST INCOME\nNoninterest income was $2.9 million in the fourth quarter of 2017, up $104,000, or 4%, from $2.8 million in the third quarter of 2017. The improvement reflects a $949,000 increase in loan level derivative income, which is related to a higher volume of new commercial loan customer back-to-back interest rate swap contracts. The amount of revenue in the loan level derivative income category can be volatile since it is a function of the amount of commercial loans that customers opt to convert from floating to fixed rate via interest rate swaps in any given quarter. This improvement was partially offset by a $594,000 drop in mortgage banking income due to seasonality and a $328,000 drop in miscellaneous income mainly reflecting lower income on CRA-qualified Small Business Investment Company investments.\nCompared to the fourth quarter of 2016, noninterest income declined $877,000, or 23%. This was mainly due to a $1.2 million decline in miscellaneous income which reflects the absence of large positive valuation adjustments recorded in 2016 on the portfolio of commercial loan customer back-to-back interest rate swap contracts and the absence of $298,000 of securities gains recorded a year ago. These declines were partially offset by a $465,000 increase in loan level derivative income and smaller increases in mortgage banking income, deposit account fees and interchange and ATM fees.\nNONINTEREST EXPENSE\nNoninterest expense was $14.2 million in the fourth quarter of 2017, up $830,000, or 6%, from $13.4 million in the third quarter of 2017 and up $676,000, or 5%, from $13.5 million in the fourth quarter of 2016. The fourth quarter of 2017 includes a $317,000 charge related to pension settlements and excluding such item, noninterest expense was up $513,000, or 4%, from the third quarter of 2017 and up $359,000, or 3%, from the fourth quarter of 2016. In addition, and as a result of the Tax Act, the Company recorded an expense of $70,000 in the fourth quarter of 2017 related to awarding a $1,000 bonus to each employee with a functional title below the Assistant Vice President level. The Company also took action to raise the hourly pay rate to $15 for a small number of hourly employees not already at that pay level. The linked quarter comparison also reflects a $200,000 increase in occupancy and equipment expense due mainly to non-capitalized equipment purchases made in the fourth quarter.\nThe fourth quarter of 2017 also includes a charge related to a settlement agreement that was reached between the Company and a former employee from a previously disclosed complaint filed by the former employee on December 30, 2014. Both parties provided mutual releases of all claims and executed a confidentiality agreement.\nINCOME TAXES\nThe Company's effective tax rate in the fourth quarter of 2017 was 78% and included a charge of approximately $2.5 million charge related to the Tax Act which was enacted on December 22, 2017. The Tax Act provides for a reduction in the corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21% effective January 1, 2018 and this reduction in the corporate tax rate resulted in a downward revaluation of the Company's net deferred tax asset which has an adjusted balance of $6.0 million at December 31, 2017. Excluding this charge, the Company's effective tax rate was 35% in the fourth quarter of 2017 compared to 38% in the third quarter of 2017. The decline in the effective tax rate in the fourth quarter was due to the tax effect associated with equity-based compensation transactions. As a result of the Tax Act, the Company expects its effective tax rate to be approximately 25% in 2018.\nASSET QUALITY\nThe provision for loan losses reflects management’s assessment of risks inherent in the loan portfolio. The provision for loan losses was $681,000 in the fourth quarter of 2017 compared to $242,000 in the third quarter of 2017 and $927,000 in the fourth quarter of 2016. Loan growth and loan mix impact the level of provision needed each quarter and the linked quarter increase in the provision reflects loan growth of 6% in the fourth quarter of 2017 compared to growth of 1% in the third quarter.\nThe allowance for loan losses as a percentage of total loans was 0.95% at December 31, 2017 compared to 0.97% at September 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016. The Company had net loan charge-offs of $52,000 in the fourth quarter of 2017 compared to net loan recoveries of $89,000 in the third quarter of 2017 and net loan recoveries of $93,000 in the fourth quarter of 2016. Net loan recoveries for the year ended December 31, 2017 were $29,000 compared to net charge-offs of $3.2 million in 2016, which included a $3.2 million net charge-off related to one commercial customer.\nNonperforming assets were $11.5 million at December 31, 2017 and September 30, 2017 compared to $9.0 million at December 31, 2016. The increase in nonperforming assets from the fourth quarter of last year was mainly due to loans secured by one income property that were placed back on nonaccrual in the first quarter of 2017. Nonperforming assets as a percentage of total assets were 0.43% at December 31, 2017 compared to 0.45% at September 30, 2017 and 0.36% at December 31, 2016.\nABOUT BLUE HILLS BANCORP\nBlue Hills Bancorp, Inc., with corporate headquarters in Norwood, MA, had assets of $2.7 billion at December 31, 2017 and operates 11 retail branch offices in Boston, Dedham, Hyde Park, Milton, Nantucket, Norwood, West Roxbury, and Westwood, Massachusetts.
