He went all of 2016-17 without scoring.\n“It was a big game for us, for our confidence,” he told Sportsnet.\nSven Baertschi, Erik Gudbranson, Alexander Edler and Jake Virtanen also scored as the Canucks posted their third win in the past 16 games.\n“Today, we wanted to compete - that was our main goal,” Gaunce told Sportsnet.\nThomas Vanek had two assists for the Canucks, including the primary helper on Gaunce’s winning tally. Henrik Sedin also notched a pair of assists.\nSeth Jones and Scott Harrington each scored for the Blue Jackets, who suffered their second straight loss.\nColumbus held a 1-0 lead after the first period, but the Canucks answered with four unanswered goals in the second period. Two goals came on power plays.\nJones gave the Blue Jackets a 1-0 lead on a slapshot at 4:33 of the first period. Henrik Sedin was off for holding at the time.\nBaertschi drew the Canucks even on a power play 1:19 into the second period as he put in Vanek’s nifty backhand pass.\nSlightly more than four minutes later, Gudbranson put the Canucks ahead 2-1 on another power play, firing in Loui Eriksson’s long pass from behind the net.\nGaunce extended Vancouver’s lead in another man-advantage situation at 14:31 of the second. Vanek provided another cheeky setup - a spin-around, backhand, cross-ice pass. Gaunce flubbed on his shot, but the puck still managed to go in off a Blue Jackets defenseman.\nEdler gave the Canucks a 4-1 lead less than four minutes later. His slapshot from the point went in off a Columbus player in front of the net.\nHarrington pulled Columbus within two goals on a long, high shot with 7:25 left in the game, but the Blue Jackets could not get any closer before Virtanen’s empty-netter closed out the scoring with less than 10 seconds to go.\n--Field Level Media\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-01-13T11:20:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-13T14:44:04.008+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
