The data will be used by regulators to spot market abuses and by investors to highlight less competitive prices;\n* Trading over the telephone replaced with electronic platforms in bonds and off-exchange derivatives to boost transparency;\n* Systematic internalizes or matching buy and sell orders for shares inside a bank will be more strictly regulated;\n* High-frequency trading or ultra fast trading rules updated;\n* EU securities watchdog ESMA gets powers to restrict or ban financial products that are harmful;\n* Banks and advisors must be clear about which type of investor is suitable for a product to avoid high-pressure sales that target everyone;\n* Asset managers must be clear to customers about who pays for stock research they get from banks;\n* Volume caps on “dark pool” or off exchange trading;\n* Position or size limits on how much of a commodity a broker can hold to avoid undue influence over market prices.\nReporting by Huw Jones.
