This proposed acquisition would strengthen Sopra Steria’s position in the German market and provide the local subsidiary further growth opportunities and access to major strategic accounts.\nFounded in 2001, BLUECARAT enjoys strong credibility among the clients in its concentrated portfolio, which includes leading manufacturers, financial services companies and public sector entities. With organic growth above 25%, BLUECARAT generated estimated revenue of about €33 million in 2017. If the acquisition is completed, the tie-up between BLUECARAT and Sopra Steria would help generate substantial commercial and cost synergies.\nSopra Steria, whose German subsidiary posted revenue of over €240 million for financial year 2016 and cemented its recovery by posting an operating performance in line with the Group’s standards for the first half of 2017 (operating margin on business activity above 8%) has very ambitious medium-term targets for the German market. The acquisition of BLUECARAT would thus help speed up the group’s development in Germany.\nThe proposed acquisition is subject to customary closing conditions. If it is completed successfully, BLUECARAT would be consolidated by Sopra Steria in the second half of 2018.\nAbout Sopra Steria\nSopra Steria, a European leader in digital transformation, provides one of the most complete portfolios of end-to-end service offers on the market: consulting, systems integration, business line software development, infrastructure management and business process services.
