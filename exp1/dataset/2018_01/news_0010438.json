China's Ministry of Transport/Handout via REUTERS \nIt collided with the freighter CF Crystal (IMO:9497050) that was carrying grain from the United States about 160 nautical miles (184 km) off China’s coast near Shanghai. \nThe Coast Guard has sent patrol boats and aircraft to monitor the situation, said a spokesman for the Japan Coast Guard’s 10th region based in Kagoshima. \nFourteen ships are carrying out emergency response work, including one from Japan and two from South Korea, the transport ministry said in a statement released late on Friday. \nThe Sanchi had a crew of 32 sailors at the time of the collision. The body of a mariner suspected to be from the ship was recovered on Monday and sent to Shanghai for identification. The rest of the crew, which included 30 Iranians and two Bangladeshis, remains missing. \nTwelve Iranian rescue workers had been brought to Shanghai to help and would join rescue work soon, Lu Kang, a spokesman from China’s foreign ministry, told a regular briefing. \nFor the map of oil tanker collision, click - tmsnrt.rs/2CBgqai \nFor the interactive 'Tanker blaze burns bright', click - tmsnrt.rs/2DmrPvL Reporting by Yuka Obayashi in TOKYO Additional reporting by Muyu Xu and Christian Shepherd in BEIJING; Writing by Josephine Mason in BEIJING; Editing by Christian Schmollinger", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-12T06:50:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-12T07:12:47.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
