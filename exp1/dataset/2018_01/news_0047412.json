The extra games are no problem for us. If it is a top Premier League team next, we will take that,” said a delighted Grigg, after becoming the tournament’s top scorer this season with his fifth and sixth goals. FAVOURITES FALTER Soccer Football - FA Cup Fourth Round - Wigan Athletic vs West Ham United - DW Stadium, Wigan, Britain - January 27, 2018 Wigan Athletic’s Will Grigg celebrates scoring their second goal Action Images via Reuters/Carl Recine \nNewport were close to pulling off an authentic FA Cup sensation against a side 72 places above them in the league hierarchy as they led Spurs 1-0 through a first-half headed goal from Irishman Padraig Amond. \nYet the dream evening for the Welsh club in front of a 10,000 sell-out at Newport’s tight Rodney Parade ground was ruined when Kane pounced from close range after an 83rd-minute corner for his 30th goal of the season in all competitions. \nIt was heartbreaking for Newport, who had held out courageously in the second half, but their substantial consolation is a replay at Wembley Stadium. Slideshow (4 Images) \nSwansea were also given an uncomfortable ride in a 1-1 draw at Meadow Lane after Luciano Narsingh’s goal just before halftime was answered by another goal in the 62nd minute from Notts County’s own cult figure, 34-year-old Jon Stead. \nStead, who helped knock out Jose Mourinho’s Chelsea in 2015 while at Bradford City, has now scored in all four rounds of the Cup this season. \nHuddersfield were in control at home to Birmingham through a first-half Steve Mounie goal but now have to go back to St Andrew’s after a 54th-minute Lukas Jutkiewicz equaliser. \nCoventry City, who caused a sensation in the third round by knocking out Premier League Stoke City, continued their heroics with a 1-0 win at League One MK Dons to ensure that one League Two side will be in the fifth round. \nIn the day’s early game, Leicester City made light work of a potentially troublesome hurdle as doubles from Kelechi Iheanacho and debutant Fousseni Diabate eased them towards a 5-1 victory at League One Peterborough United. \nThe first all-Premier League tie of the round saw Southampton knock out Watford 1-0 with a fourth-minute goal from Jack Stephens - the perfect way for the defender to celebrate his 24th birthday. \nNottingham Forest, who knocked out holders Arsenal in the third round, had their adventure ended in a 2-1 defeat at fellow Championship side Hull City. \nLiverpool host West Bromwich Albion in the day’s late kick-off.
