It is a Europe that must have a common foreign policy on strategic questions, a Europe that must create its own development policies, a Europe of defence, and it is a Europe that has to be economically strong.”\nShe said the two countries could make relatively quick progress on areas such as a common corporate tax structure and a banking union for the euro zone.\nReporting by Andreas Rinke; Writing by Joseph Nasr in Berlin; Editing by Andrea Shalal\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-01-20T01:17:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-20T17:45:51.019+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
