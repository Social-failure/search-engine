Last month, the government instituted real-name policies for virtual-currency traders and banned investors from opening new accounts. \nThe chair of the country’s Financial Services Commission told the parliament on Thursday that the government was still considering shutting down all local cryptocurrency exchanges, or at least those that have been breaking the law. \nNonetheless, the value of bitcoin has remained relatively stable in recent days, at around $11,500.
