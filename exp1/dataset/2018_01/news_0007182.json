William West—AFP/Getty Images By Emma Hinchliffe 12:35 PM EST \nNineties and early aughts beach favorites are together at last. The company behind Quiksilver bought Australian surf brand Billabong for $155 million on Friday. \nBoth brands, while around for decades in Australia, enjoyed peak popularity in the United States in the late ’90s and early 2000s, in the era of UGG boots and Australian surfer-inspired style. Quiksilver is now officially known as Boardriders Inc., and is part of the firm Oaktree Capital Management. Oaktree already held a 19% stake in Billabong through a refinancing deal meant to save the company in 2013 and now bought Billabong in full through its 85% ownership of the former Quiksilver. Oaktree also owns Roxy, the other popular surf brand of the era. Swimming trunks for sale at a store on Kalakaua Avenue.

Billabong lost a little over $60 million after taxes last year, Reuters reported . Friday’s deal was priced at $1 per share, or about $0.79, with Billabong’s board of directors unanimously recommending the agreement. \nThe companies expect the deal to close in the first half of 2018.
