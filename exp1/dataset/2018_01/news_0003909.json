That investigation is supervised by Special Counsel Robert Mueller into U.S. allegations of Russian meddling in the 2016 election campaign to tilt the election in Trump’s favour. \nMoscow has denied any effort to influence the election and Trump denies any campaign collusion. Trump supporters have said that the “dossier” and other allegations of Trump involvement with Russia are smears concocted by Trump’s political enemies. \nIn December, news outlets reported that Nunes would ask his committee to vote to hold the Justice Department and FBI in contempt of Congress if they did not turn over the material sought by the committee. It is unclear whether such a vote has already been taken. \nA spokesman for Nunes did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
