The country will announce Q4 and 2017 GDP growth on Thursday. \nAnalysts expect the People’s Bank of China (PBOC) to keep its benchmark lending rate unchanged at 4.35 percent through at least the second quarter of 2019, the Reuters poll showed. \nThey have, however, pushed back their expectations on a cut in the amount of cash that banks are required to hold as reserves - the reserve requirement ratio (RRR). \nThe central bank is forecast to cut the RRR for all banks by 25 basis points (bps) in the fourth quarter of 2018 to 16.75 percent, versus the October poll’s prediction for a 50-bps cut in the second quarter this year. \nThe poll predicted annual consumer inflation to be more pronounced at 2.3 percent in 2018, up from the 2.2 percent estimated in the October survey due to rising services prices. The higher rate could remain through to 2019, the poll showed. TRADE TAILWIND, PROTECTIONISM RISKS \nOn the whole, the forecasts back broad consensus of a gradual, rather than a sharp, slowdown in growth as authorities focus on turning off China’s years-long addiction to cheap money without imperiling the economy. \nA resilient real estate market, which has slowed due to curbs on risky lending practices, could be a drag on the economy this year, analysts say. \nAt a key twice-a-decade Communist Party Congress last October, President Xi Jinping said China has entered a new era where it looks to move from high-speed to high-quality growth to achieve moderate prosperity. \nA synchronized uptick in global growth, which has driven a worldwide trade boom and benefited China and other export-reliant nations over the past year, is expected to continue supporting the Asian giant. As well, a consumption boost from the rising numbers of Chinese to the middle class rank is seen providing a counterweight to some weakness in investment growth, analysts say. \nTrade protectionism is one of the risks that could play out in the year ahead. \n“While we remain comfortable about China’s export outlook for 2018, there are still uncertainties about Sino-US trade ties which may suddenly erupt,” Betty Wang, a Hong Kong-based analyst at ANZ, wrote in a note.
