He limped off to the locker room midway through the first half, however, with an apparent groin injury.\nTexas made only one basket over the final 9:21 of the half, missing nine straight shots and committing four turnovers.\nThe Longhorns, who entered Saturday with a 45 RPI, had not lost a game by double-digits this season.\nWest Virginia made all 12 of its free throws and put the game away with 65-pecent shooting from the floor after halftime.\n--Field Level Media\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-01-21T06:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-21T13:23:29.037+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
