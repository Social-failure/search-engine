Boucher could have faced up to 10 years behind bars. \nPaul was wearing headphones while mowing his lawn when Boucher became angered by seeing the 55-year-old senator stack brush near Boucher’s property, the U.S. Department of Justice said in a statement. \nBoucher had “had enough” and he ran onto Paul’s yard and tackled him, the statement said, causing Paul to suffer multiple fractured ribs as well as complications that meant he contracted pneumonia. \nThe attack raised questions about whether Paul had been targeted because of his politics. But Boucher, who like Paul is a physician, told investigators that was not the case, the statement said.

I know that he wishes that it had never happened.” FILE PHOTO: Rene Boucher, 59, of Bowling Green, appears in a booking photo provided by the Warren County Detention Center in Bowling Green, Kentucky, U.S. on November 3, 2017.

Boucher had previously pleaded not guilty to a misdemeanor assault charge that was brought by local prosecutors in Kentucky in connection with the incident.
