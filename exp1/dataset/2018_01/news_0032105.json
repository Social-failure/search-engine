Gbagbo is now on trial at the International Criminal Court for crimes against humanity.\nDetails of the plan to reinstate Gbagbo in a coup were found on Kouassi’s computer hard drive after his arrest. At the time, Kouassi said he wanted to ask for Ouattara’s forgiveness.\nKouassi’s lawyer Felix Bobre said his client would appeal against the decision. He said Kouassi was being targeted just because of his association with the disgraced ex-president.\n“This conviction confirms the denial of justice in Ivory Coast and the systematic condemnation of all the relatives of former president Gbagbo in arranged and unjust lawsuits,” said Bobre.\nReporting by Ange Aboa; Writing by Edward McAllister; Editing by Gareth Jones\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-01-19T19:32:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-19T14:12:10.002+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
