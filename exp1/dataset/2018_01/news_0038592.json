House prices have been outpacing a rise in wages for Britons, leading people to rent more, making buy-to-let an attractive investment.\nThe buy-to-let market is facing stricter regulations and the most recent regulatory changes require lenders to collect and analyse more information about a landlord’s property portfolio.\nParagon said this had resulted in a “realignment of competition”, with a number of mainstream lenders shrinking their buy-to-let business.\n“Paragon’s experience and capability is well aligned with these new requirements, allowing the Group to increase its share of more specialist portfolio landlord business,” it said on Tuesday.\nThe lender’s Idem Capital division, a consumer debt buyer and servicer of third-party loans, saw no new deals completing during the quarter.\nCommercial lending jumped 21 percent to 103.3 million pounds in the quarter.
