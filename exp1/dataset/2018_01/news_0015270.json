Media reports have said founders plan to float the firm in the coming years.\n“For the first time we’re bringing true multi-country banking - with real bank details in key currencies - to anyone who needs it,” Taavet Hinrikus, chairman and co-founder of TransferWise, said.\nUntil now, consumers using TransferWise could only send money overseas. Users pay into the firm’s account at home, and TransferWise pays the sum out of its bank account in the recipient’s local country at the real exchange rate.\nReporting by Emma Rumney; editing by Alexander Smith\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-01-09T08:13:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-09T17:06:37.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
