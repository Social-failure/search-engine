There was insufficient crushed mill feed for the Avino circuit. This has been rectified with the technical assistance from Metso, who are the suppliers of the crusher.\n3.\nTonnage processed increased by 8% as Circuit 2 was dedicated to processing Avino material rather than the San Gonzalo for the entire quarter.\n4.\nFeed material for the quarter primarily came from the main Avino vein, resulting in higher copper, and lower gold and silver, and therefore reflective of the changes of 41%, -53%, and -23% respectively.\n5.\nWith the change in feed and minerology, copper recovery was down 3%, no change in gold recovery and silver recovery increased by 2%.\n6.\nThe changes in the quality of the mill feed resulted in 9% more concentrate produced and the grade of copper increased by 35%, whereas the gold and silver grades decreased by 54% and 22% respectively. In addition, copper production increased by 47%, gold decreased by 50% and silver decreased by 15% resulting in an increase of 6% in silver equivalent ounces for the quarter.\nAvino Mine 2017 Year-End Production Highlights\n7.\nThe year over year change in mined tonnes and development is attributed primarily to the transition from development to production mining.\n8.\nTonnage processed increased by 7% as Circuit 2 was used exclusively to process Avino material.\n9.\nGold feed grade increased by 23% whereas copper and silver decreased by 3% and 4% respectively; the changes in grades are due to the mineralisation in the areas being mined.\n10.\nConcentrate production increased by 4% with little to no change in the copper and silver grades but the gold increased by 37% due to the higher mill feed.\n11.\nGold production increased by 42%, copper by 4% and silver by 2% resulting in 19% more silver equivalent ounces of production.\nSan Gonzalo Mine Production Highlights\nComparative figures for the years ended December 31, 2017, and December 31, 2016, as well as the fourth quarter 2017 and the fourth quarter of 2016 for the San Gon", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-16T14:45:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-16T17:08:58.024+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
