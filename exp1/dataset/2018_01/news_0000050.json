Trump added that \"Steve doesn't represent my base — he's only in it for himself.\" \n\"Steve pretends to be at war with the media, which he calls the opposition party, yet he spent his time at the White House leaking false information to the media to make himself seem far more important than he was,\" Trump said.\n\"It is the only thing he does well. Steve was rarely in a one-on-one meeting with me and only pretends to have had influence to fool a few people with no access and no clue, whom he helped write phony books,\" he added. \nThis is breaking news.
