Anglo American ( AAL.L ) was among the worst-performing. \nBanks ING ( INGA.AS ), HSBC ( HSBA.L ), and insurers AXA ( AXAF.PA ) and Prudential ( PRU.L ) were the biggest laggards among financials. Europe’s banks index fell 0.8 percent while financial services stocks dropped 0.7 percent. \nTech stocks .SX8P meanwhile outperformed the market, gaining 0.2 percent. \nResults drove trading, with investors rewarding Swatch and Alfa Laval while Loomis and Philips disappointed. \nLoomis ( LOOMb.ST ) was bottom of the STOXX, down 8.2 percent after the Swedish support services firm reported fourth-quarter profit missed forecasts.[nFWN1PP06C] \nSwatch ( UHR.S ) was among the top gainers on the index after impressive results. The Swiss watchmaker’s profit rose 28 percent in 2017, and it said it expected ‘very positive’ growth in 2018. [nL8N1PP0TJ] \nSwedish engineering group Alfa Laval ( ALFA.ST ) gained 3 percent after its fourth quarter order intake far exceeded market forecasts. [nL8N1PP17Y] \nWind turbine maker Siemens Gamesa ( SGREN.MC ) gained 5 percent after its first-quarter results. [nL8N1PP1KC] \nMedical technology firm Philips ( PHG.AS ) fell back 2 percent, with traders pointing to the firm missing fourth-quarter earnings and revenue expectations. \nM&A also drove trading with shares in British conference organizer UBM ( UBM.L ) rising 3 percent after Informa ( INF.L ) sealed its 3.8 billion pound ($5.3 billion) takeover of the firm.
