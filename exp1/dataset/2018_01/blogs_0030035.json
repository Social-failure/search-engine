Fare differences for premium economy vary, but a recent search of a flight in February from Philadelphia to Paris on American Airlines' premium economy showed a fare that was 27 percent more expensive than a seat in the regular coach cabin.\nUnited executives will likely provide more details about the launch during its investor day and earnings presentation on Tuesday after the market closes.\nAirlines including United are in the process of slicing their cabins into smaller classes to increase passenger revenue.\nUnited last year rolled out its basic economy class across U.S. markets. In exchange for a lower fare, passengers in basic economy are not allowed to select their seats, board last and can't make changes to their tickets. On United and American, they can't use overhead bins. Delta and American executives have said that around half of passengers choose the higher, regular economy fare to avoid the no-frills class.\nIn addition to basic economy, United is scrambling to outfit its planes with seats for its new business class, called Polaris.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-19T05:19:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-19T06:02:32.025+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
