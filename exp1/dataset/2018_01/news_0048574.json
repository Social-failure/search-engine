Slideshow (4 Images) \nFeuz, skiing fifth, was well outside Svindal’s time at the halfway mark but picked up time as he threw caution to the wind near the end. \nFeuz, who claimed the 10th World Cup win of his career, previously won this season at Lake Louise and Wengen. \nHe was also second in Beaver Creek and Kitzbuehel and leads the World Cup downhill standings with 542 points, 40 ahead of Svindal with Paris third. \nAustrian slalom specialist Marcel Hirscher leads the overall standings ahead of Henrik Kristoffersen with Svindal third and Feuz fifth.
