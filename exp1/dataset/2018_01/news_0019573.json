Boone Pickens, a famous oilman and investment manager, said he is closing the energy-focused hedge fund he has run for the last two decades as his health declines. \nThe move closes a chapter in a nearly seven-decade career that has included stints as a wildcatter, corporate raider, cattle trader and clean-energy evangelist. \nThe 89-year-old Oklahoma native cited both his deteriorating health and weak financial performance as reasons for closing the fund, according to a letter that he plans to publish soon and was reviewed by The Wall Street Journal. Pickens said he is recovering from a series of strokes last year and a bad fall. \n“It’s no secret the past year has not been good to me, from a health perspective or a financial one,” he wrote in the letter. “If you are lucky enough to make it to 89 years of age like I have, those things tend to put life in perspective.” \nPopular on WSJ.com: ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-12T13:42:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-12T14:06:30.045+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
