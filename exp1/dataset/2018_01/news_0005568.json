It also exempts U.S. corporations from U.S. taxes on most future foreign profits, sets a one-time tax for U.S. business profits now held overseas, and prevents companies from shifting profits out of the United States to lower-tax jurisdictions abroad.\nBristol-Myers said it is still evaluating all the provisions of the legislation and currently estimates that the net impact on its adjusted tax rate will be roughly neutral in 2018.\nThe drugmaker plans an update when it provides a full-year outlook on Feb. 5.\nReporting by Deena Beasley; Editing by Tom Brown\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-06T01:41:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-06T01:55:06.017+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
