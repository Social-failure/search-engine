Last year, KKR bought a majority control of vitamin maker Nature’s Bounty.\nEditing by Christopher Mangham\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-01-25T21:37:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-26T21:29:08.003+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
