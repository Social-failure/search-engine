Numerous existing investors, such as Konica Minolta and Bright Success Capital, plus over 5,000 new investors participated in the latest funding activities. Knightscope raised approximately $20 million through the Reg A+ offering and was oversubscribed by over $5 million due to significant investor demand. The company was able to accommodate the oversubscriptions in private placement transactions.\nThese financings add to the over $14 million closed in the company’s previous three rounds, bringing the total capital raised since inception in 2013 to $39+ million.\nKnightscope’s Reg A+ offering is also the most successful campaign in SeedInvest’s history.
