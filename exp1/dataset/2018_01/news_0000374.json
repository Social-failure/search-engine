The book will be published Jan. 9 by Henry Holt. NBC News obtained a copy of the book ahead of its release.\nIn a statement, President Donald Trump said: \"Steve Bannon has nothing to do with me or my Presidency. When he was fired, he not only lost his job, he lost his mind. \" \nBannon is also quoted in the book saying the meeting was \"treasonous\" and \"unpatriotic.\" \nAttendees of the meeting included Russian lawyer Natalia Veselnitskaya and other Russians. Trump was reportedly in Trump Tower on June 9 , the day of the meeting.\nBannon joined the Trump campaign team two months after the meeting. \nBannon was ousted from the White House in August after seven months as an influential operative known to have the president's ear. He has reportedly remained in contact with Trump since leaving the administration.\nAn attorney for Trump Jr. did not respond to a CNBC request for comment.\nWATCH: Trump disavows Steve Bannon: 'He not only lost his job, he lost his mind' show chapters Trump disavows Steve Bannon: 'He not only lost his job, he lost his mind'      42 Mins Ago | 06:05", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-03T19:35:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-03T19:36:08.030+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
