October was upwardly revised to an increase of 4.4 percent from an initially reported 3.5 percent gain.\nPermits for nonresidential structures declined 12.3 percent, with drops seen across the commercial, industrial and institutional components.\nPermits for single-family homes were up 0.6 percent, driven by increases in Ontario. But plans for multifamily buildings declined 10.1 percent, pulling residential building permits as a whole down 4.6 percent.\nCanada saw robust construction activity last year with housing starts exceeding economists’ estimates but activity is seen slowing in 2018 amid tighter mortgage rules and expected interest rate increases.\nReporting by Leah Schnurr; Editing by Jeffrey Benkoe\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-01-10T21:44:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-10T15:56:54.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
