Czech Republic's Denisa Allertova in action during her match against Ukraine's Elina Svitolina. REUTERS/Thomas Peter Allertova, the first qualifier to reach the fourth round since 2010, had won their only previous meeting in Doha last year and initially matched Svitolina stroke-for-stroke in some lengthy baseline rallies.\nThey exchanged breaks at the start of the opening set but Svitolina grabbed another for 3-2 when the Czech went long with a forehand and the Ukrainian backed it up with a couple of aces to hold her next service game.\nSlideshow (2 Images) The world number four had a bit of fortune on set point when her scrambled shot hit the net cord and threw Allertova, who dumped her backhand into the net, but there was no doubting Svitolina deserved her 1-0 lead after 36 minutes.\nThe second set was a procession. Svitolina thumped a backhand winner to break for 2-0 with a return from the same side smashed into an empty back court ending the contest inside the hour.\n“I‘m very pleased with the way I‘m playing here because it’s not the first time I‘m going into the tournament as one of the favourites,” Svitolina added.\n“It’s more pressure but it also gives you confidence ... I’ll just try to do my best and see how it goes.”\nReporting by Nick Mulvenney in Sydney, editing by Toby Davis\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-21T16:47:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-21T17:03:33.002+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
