On July 3, 2017, the name of the adviser was changed from Pioneer Investment Management, Inc., coinciding with its acquisition by Amundi. As a result of the transaction, Amundi Pioneer Asset Management, Inc. became an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of Amundi. Amundi, one of the world’s largest asset managers, is headquartered in Paris, France.\nKeep in mind, distribution rates are not guaranteed. A fund’s distribution rate may be affected by numerous factors, including changes in actual or projected investment income, the level of undistributed net investment income, if any, and other factors. Shareholders should not draw any conclusions about a fund’s investment performance based on a fund’s current distributions. Closed-end funds, unlike open-end funds, are not continuously offered. Once issued, common shares of closed-end funds are bought and sold in the open market through a stock exchange and frequently trade at prices lower than their net asset value. Net Asset Value (NAV) is total assets less total liabilities divided by the number of common shares outstanding. For performance data on Amundi Pioneer's closed-end funds, please call 800-225-6292 or visit our closed-end pricing page.\nAbout Amundi Pioneer Asset Management\nAmundi Pioneer Asset Management (Amundi Pioneer) references the U.S. business of Amundi, Europe’s largest asset manager by assets under management and among the top ten global asset managers. 1 Amundi Pioneer was formed in July 2017 as part of Amundi’s acquisition of Pioneer Investments, and includes the operations of Amundi Pioneer Asset Management USA, Inc. based in Boston and Durham, NC.
