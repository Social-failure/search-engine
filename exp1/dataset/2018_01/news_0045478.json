The Company also expects to exceed conservative estimates of $53 million in revenues for FY 2018 and $107 million for FY 2019 from APR gold processing using proprietary Hymax technology.\nWith respect to the cannabis industry, since the Company’s announcement regarding PHI EZ Water’s products ( www.phiezwater.com ) on October 17, 2017, the Company has actively worked with cannabis growers in the U.S. and Canada, including GrowersNetwork ( http://growersnetwork.org/ ), to provide our proprietary water enhancement systems that may reduce water consumption by up to 30% and fertilizer usage by 30%-50% while boosting cannabis crop yields by 30%-50%. PHI EZ Water’s conservative projected revenues from sales of water enhancement systems are $12,500,000 for FY 2018 and $25,000,000 for FY 2019. The Company will also use the water enhancement systems to grow medical marijuana and medicinal plants for its greenhouse project in Transylvania, Romania, which is expected to add significant revenues and profitability.\nIn addition, the Company has been working on a number of crucial projects in the recent months which can potentially transform the company in extraordinary ways in the very near future, including institutional bank funds, cross-border acquisitions, and burgeoning hot industries such as blockchain and crytocurrencies, etc. The Company will update on further progress regarding these subject matters in the coming weeks, including financial plans and conceivably substantial impact on future operating results.\nAbout PHI Group\nPHI Group ( www.phiglobal.com ) primarily focuses on mergers and acquisitions and invests in select industries and special situations that may substantially enhance shareholder value.
