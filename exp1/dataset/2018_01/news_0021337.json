(BOC) by the end of June 2018.\nThe West Qurna 1 oilfield, operated by Exxon Mobile, currently produces around 405,000 barrels per day.\nReporting by Rania El Gamal, editing by Louise Heavens\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-01-15T22:19:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-15T22:15:25.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
