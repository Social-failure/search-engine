GKN shares closed at 445 pence on Thursday. \nMelrose’s bid is one of the biggest hostile takeover attempts in Britain since Kraft bought chocolate maker Cadbury in 2009. Pfizer’s attempt to buy AstraZeneca in 2014 and Kraft Heinz’s tilt at Unilever last year were both abandoned after successful defense plans were put up by the target companies. BREAK-UP \nMelrose, whose business model is to buy engineering companies, improve their margins and resell them, already owns diversified firm Nortek and the Brush electricity generating equipment businesses. \nGKN said on Thursday that Melrose’s board had “very limited experience ... of managing Tier 1 aerospace and automotive suppliers.” \n“GKN is more than five times larger than any of Melrose’s prior acquisitions by revenue,” GKN chief executive Anne Stevens said in a statement. \nGKN also refuted Melrose’s suggestion that it was rushing into a break up, saying the timing of the separation “will be determined by the need to maximize the economic benefits and minimize the costs associated with separation”. \nA source familiar with the situation said earlier this week that Elliott Advisors, which has a small interest in GKN, thinks it should open talks with Melrose, though the fund considers the existing offer unattractive. \nA regulatory filing on Thursday showed Elliott cut its interest in GKN to 0.5 percent after Melrose went hostile with its bid on Wednesday, from the previously disclosed 1.7 percent. \nAnother fund, Vulcan, has also trimmed its interest in GKN to 3.9 percent from 4.1 percent, a separate filing showed. The Financial Times reported on Monday that Vulcan wanted GKN to hold discussions with its suitor. \nMelrose bought engineering firm Elster for 1.8 billion pounds in 2012, selling it to Honeywell Inc for 3.3 billion pounds three years later. It returned 2.4 billion pounds to shareholders in 2016. \nMelrose has some experience of aerospace businesses after buying McKechnie, a manufacturer of aerospace components, and Dynacast, which makes small engineered precision components, in 2005. It sold its aerospace and aftermarket businesses in 2007. \nRothschild, RBC Europe and Investec are advising Melrose, while GKN is working with Gleacher Shacklock, JPMorgan Cazenove and UBS.
