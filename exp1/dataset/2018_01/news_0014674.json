To retain the unique talent and loyalty of our stylist community, we intend to offer many of our impacted stylists and salon managers comparable positions in other SmartStyle or Regis family of brands salons.”\nMr. Sawyer continued, “Consistent with our multi-year strategic plan, Regis is taking steps in 2018 to restructure our salon portfolio to improve shareholder value and position the company for long-term growth. Today’s announcement, when combined with the previously announced sale and subsequent franchising of our mall-based and international salons, delivers on that commitment.”\n“This initiative is a positive step forward and we anticipate this action will allow Regis to reallocate capital and human resources to strategically grow our remaining 2,000 SmartStyle salons with creative new offerings within Walmart,” said Mr. Sawyer.\n“Regis is committed to maintaining our leadership position in the salon industry,” added Mr. Sawyer. “As a result, we are making significant strategic and operational changes to our business to increase customer traffic, invest in new technologies, decrease non-strategic costs, expand our franchise capabilities and create a new eco-system for customer interaction.”\nThe closure of this group of nonperforming company owned salons is expected to be the only material reduction in Regis’ SmartStyle salon portfolio for the foreseeable future. “With SmartStyle and other Regis brands continuing to maintain an extensive Company owned and franchised footprint across the country, we believe this action will substantially complete the restructuring of our nonperforming Company owned salon portfolio during the first year of our strategic and operational transformation,” Mr. Sawyer concluded.\nAnnouncement Conference Call and Webcast\nRegis Corporation will host a conference call via webcast discussing this announcement today, January 8, 2018, at 9 a.m., Central time.
