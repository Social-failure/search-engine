It has been linked to thousands of suspected cases of microcephaly, a typically rare birth defect marked by unusually small head size, as well as eye abnormalities and nerve damage resulting in joint problems and deafness.\nFor the study, the CDC examined data from existing birth defect surveillance systems in 15 U.S. jurisdictions to look for birth defects possibly associated with Zika.\nThey broke these states and territories down into three groups - places with local Zika transmission, places with higher levels of travel-associated Zika, and places with lower rates of travel related Zika.\nOverall, they found that an excess of three cases of birth defects per 1,000 live births that may have been linked with Zika virus infection out of a group of 1 million births in 2016.\nBecause many pregnant women exposed to Zika virus in late 2016 gave birth in 2017, CDC researchers anticipate that there could be another increase in possible Zika-related birth defects when 2017 data are analyzed.\n“This report highlights the critical importance of documenting birth defects possibly related to Zika and our need to maintain vigilance,” CDC Director Dr. Brenda Fitzgerald said in a statement.\nReporting by Julie Steenhuysen; Editing by Alistair Bell\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-25T20:17:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-25T20:43:58.027+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
