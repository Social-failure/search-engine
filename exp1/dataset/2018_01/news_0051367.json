The total return does not include the effect of purchased loan charge-offs or recoveries in the quarter. 2. Deposits decreased by $41.2 million, or 4.6%, from June 30, 2017, attributable primarily to a decrease in money market accounts of $22.3 million, or 6.0%, and a decrease in time deposits of $19.4 million, or 5.8%.\n3. Shareholders’ equity increased by $7.2 million, or 5.9%, from June 30, 2017, primarily due to earnings of $7.9 million, partially offset by stock option exercises which decreased additional paid-in-capital by $1.1 million and dividends paid on common stock of $177 thousand. Additionally, there was stock-based compensation of $485 thousand.\nNet income increased by $204 thousand to $3.3 million for the quarter ended December 31, 2017, compared to net income of $3.1 million for the quarter ended December 31, 2016.\n1. Net interest and dividend income before provision for loan losses increased by $624 thousand for the quarter ended December 31, 2017, compared to the quarter ended December 31, 2016. The increase is primarily due to higher average balances in the total loan portfolio. This increase was partially offset by higher funding costs and higher average deposit balances.\nThe following table summarizes interest income and related yields recognized on the loan portfolios:\nInterest Income and Yield on Loans Three Months Ended December 31, 2017\n2016\nAverage\nInterest\nAverage\nInterest\nBalance (1)\nIncome\nYield\nBalance (1)\nIncome\nYield\n(Dollars in thousands)\nCommunity Banking $ 141,486 $ 1,753 4.92 % $ 203,963 $ 2,350 4.57 % SBA 49,457 814 6.53 % 41,038 574 5.55 % LASG: Originated 340,240 5,565 6.49 % 216,353 3,210 5.89 % Purchased 229,732 6,369 11.00 % 233,502 7,659 13.01 % Secured Loans to Broker-Dealers - - 0.00 % 48,000 120 0.99 % Total LASG 569,972 11,934 8.31 % 497,855 10,989 8.76 % Total $ 760,915 $ 14,501 7.56 % $ 742,856 $ 13,913 7.43 % Six Months Ended December 31,\n2017\n2016\nAverage\nInterest\nAverage\nInterest\nBalance (1)\nIncome\nYield\nBalance (1)\nIncome\nYield\n(Dollars in thousands)\nCommunity Banking $ 145,832 $ 3,496 4.76 % $ 204,864 $ 4,754 4.60 % SBA 51,499 1,756 6.76 % 36,093 1,093 6.01 % LASG: Originated 334,507 10,831 6.42 % 200,731 5,949 5.88 % Purchased 234,928 13,800 11.65 % 232,751 13,740 11.71 % Secured Loans to Broker-Dealers - - 0.00 % 48,000 180 0.74 % Total LASG 569,435 24,631 8.58 % 481,482 19,869 8.19 % Total $ 766,766 $ 29,883 7.73 % $ 722,439 $ 25,716 7.06 % (1) Includes loans held for sale. The components of total transactional income on purchased loans are set forth in the table below entitled “Total Return on Purchased Loans.” When compared to the three months ended December 31, 2016, transactional income decreased by $1.0 million. The total return on purchased loans for the three months ended December 31, 2017 was 11.0%. The decrease over the prior comparable period was primarily due to lower accelerated accretion in the three months ended December 31, 2017. When compared to the six months ended December 31, 2016, transactional income increased by $432 thousand. This increase over the prior comparable period was primarily due to higher loan fees in the six months ended December 31, 2017. The following table details the total return on purchased loans:\nTotal Return on Purchased Loans Three Months Ended December 31, 2017 2016 Income Return (1) Income Return (1) (Dollars in thousands) Regularly scheduled interest and accretion $ 4,466 7.71 % $ 4,716 8.01 % Transactional income: Gain on loan sales - 0.00 % - 0.00 % Gain on sale of real estate owned - 0.00 % - 0.00 % Other noninterest income - 0.00 % - 0.00 % Accelerated accretion and loan fees 1,903 3.29 % 2,943 5.00 % Total transactional income 1,903 3.29 % 2,943 5.00 % Total $ 6,369 11.00 % $ 7,659 13.01 %\nTotal Return on Purchased Loans Six Months Ended December 31, 2017 2016 Income Return (1) Income Return (1) (Dollars in thousands) Regularly scheduled interest and accretion $ 9,079 7.67 % $ 9,470 8.07 % Transactional income: Gain on loan sales - 0.00 % - 0.00 % Gain on sale of real estate owned - 0.00 % 19 0.02 % Other noninterest income - 0.00 % - 0.00 % Accelerated accretion and loan fees 4,721 3.98 % 4,270 3.64 % Total transactional income 4,721 3.98 % 4,289 3.66 % Total $ 13,800 11.65 % $ 13,759 11.73 % (1) The total return on purchased loans represents scheduled accretion, accelerated accretion, gains on asset sales, gains on real estate owned and other noninterest income recorded during the period divided by the average invested balance, which includes loans held for sale, on an annualized basis. The total return does not include the effect of purchased loan charge-offs or recoveries in the quarter. Total return is considered a non-GAAP financial measure. 2. Noninterest income decreased by $1.5 million for the quarter ended December 31, 2017, compared to the quarter ended December 31, 2016, principally due to the following:\nA decrease in gain on sale of SBA loans of $1.4 million, due to a lower amount of SBA loans sold in the quarter; and A decrease in gain on sale of residential loans held for sale of $82 thousand, due to lower volume of residential loans sold in the quarter.\n3. Noninterest expense decreased by $393 thousand for the quarter ended December 31, 2017, compared to the quarter ended December 31, 2016, primarily due to the following:\nA decrease in other noninterest expense of $395 thousand, primarily due to a $330 thousand decrease in expense related to the quarterly valuation of SBA servicing rights; and A decrease in loan expense of $179 thousand, largely driven by lower expense related to loan acquisition and refinance activity. The decreases in noninterest expense were partially offset by an increase in data processing fees of $214 thousand, primarily due to the increased cost associated with outsourcing of data processing.\n4. Income tax expense decreased by $458 thousand for the quarter ended December 31, 2017, compared to the quarter ended December 31, 2016, primarily due to the following:\nA decrease in the federal corporate income tax rate as a result of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act signed into law on December 22, 2017, which resulted in a $762 thousand decrease in federal income tax expense. Of this total, $328 thousand was related to the decrease in the federal corporate income tax rate for the three months ended December 31, 2017 and $434 thousand was related to income tax expense previously recorded in the three months ended September 30, 2017, to arrive at the required blended federal corporate income tax rate of 28.0% for fiscal year 2018; and A decrease in income tax expense as a result of a $279 thousand income tax benefit arising from the treatment of stock options exercised or vested restricted stock awards under ASU 2016-09, Compensation—Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting , whereby the tax effects of exercised options or vested awards are treated as a discrete item in the reporting period in which they occur. The decreases in income tax expense were partially offset by the impact of revaluing the deferred tax asset as a result of the change in the federal corporate income tax rate as well as the recording of current year changes in the deferred tax asset, which resulted in an increase in income tax expense of $498 thousand.\nAs of December 31, 2017, nonperforming assets totaled $19.0 million, or 1.84% of total assets, as compared to $18.7 million, or 1.78% of total assets, as of September 30, 2017, and $14.8 million, or 1.37% of total assets, as of June 30, 2017.\nAs of December 31, 2017, past due loans totaled $30.0 million, or 3.87% of total loans, as compared to $12.1 million, or 1.60% of total loans as of September 30, 2017, and $13.4 million, or 1.72% of total loans as of June 30, 2017. The increase was primarily attributable to $5.3 million of loans purchased in December that were delinquent at purchase, as well as $8.8 million of loans that were 30 days past due as of December 31, 2017 and are now current.\nAs of December 31, 2017, the Company’s Tier 1 Leverage Ratio was 13.4%, compared to 12.8% at June 30, 2017, and the Total Capital Ratio was 20.3%, compared to 19.5% at June 30, 2017. The increase in both the Tier 1 Leverage Ratio and the Total Capital Ratio resulted primarily from the increase in earnings and the net decrease in the loan portfolio.\nInvestor Call Information\nRichard Wayne, Chief Executive Officer of Northeast Bancorp, and Jean-Pierre Lapointe, Chief Financial Officer of Northeast Bancorp, will host a conference call to discuss second quarter earnings and business outlook at 10:00 a.m. Eastern Time on Tuesday, January 30th.
