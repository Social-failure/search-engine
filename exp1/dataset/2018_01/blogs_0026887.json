Recent better results notwithstanding, retail is still subject to significant disruption, while Walmart, we think, is still very much in control of its own destiny,\" analyst Matthew Fassler wrote in a note to clients Thursday. \"We expect the mass market to benefit from stronger income growth, and from personal tax reform.\" \nFassler increased his price target for the retailer to $117 from $115, representing 14 percent upside from Wednesday's close. \nHe said tax reform will give an average annual benefit of $1,018 per tax payer filing. The tax relief as a percentage of income for the key income brackets in the $40,000 to $200,000 range will be 1 percent to 1.8 percent, he added. \n\"We expect a meaningful dividend hike as the firm redeploys cash from tax savings, and repatriated overseas cash,\" he wrote. \nWalmart shares rose 1.7 percent in early trading Thursday. \n— CNBC's Michael Bloom contributed to this story.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-18T14:19:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-18T14:31:50.018+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
