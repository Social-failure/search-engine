(CSE: MYM) (CSE: MYM.CN) (OTCQB: MYMMF) (the \"Company\" or \" MYM \") is pleased to announce that the Company has entered into a binding letter of intent with Budly Software Inc. (\" Budly \"), a leading software company that has developed a smartphone-enabled sales and distribution system connecting medicinal cannabis patients with local dispensary drivers for fast delivery and monitoring of orders. Using the system, a customer can select a dispensary, place an order, and then choose a driver to deliver it. The customer can then track the order on his smartphone and knows exactly when it will arrive. Orders can be placed via the Budly app on iOS, Android and Windows phones, and via the website www.budly.com .\n\"The Budly software is a game-changer for MYM because it brings us one step closer to becoming a fully integrated global cannabis company,\" commented Rob Gietl, CEO of MYM. \"Budly's clean and simple interface allows orders to be easily placed by patients, right on their phone, and provides extensive back end management and logistics control for licensed producers and dispensaries.\"\nThe Budly system consists of two iOS apps, two Android apps, one web app, a dispensary backend admin and a master admin system.

The Budly system can easily be customized for the individual requirements and regulations for different countries and regions.\nPursuant to the letter of intent, MYM will issue 800,000 common shares to Budly in exchange for all non-U.S. rights to Budly's software and intellectual property.
