It also permanently lowers the U.S. corporate rate to 21 percent from 35 percent.\nThe announcement makes FedEx the latest U.S. company to promise higher pay for workers, citing the tax cuts.\nFedEx, which said the recent tax changes would likely boost economic growth and investment in the United States, also said it would contribute $1.5 billion to an employee pension plan.\nThe company plans more than $200 million in higher compensation, about two-thirds of which will go to hourly employees with the remainder funding increases in performance-based incentive plans for salaried workers.\nFedEx shares were down 0.3 percent in morning trading.\nReporting by Rachit Vats in Bengaluru, Eric M.
