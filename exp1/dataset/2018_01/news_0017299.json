Allertova won 6-4 7-6(5). \nWith 15-year-old Ukrainian Marta Kostyuk also getting through it means three qualifiers have made the third round in the bottom half of the wide open women’s draw. \nTimea Babos, who put paid to the hopes of a third American seed, CoCo Vandeweghe, in the first round was in action later. \nLuksika, ranked 124th in the world, produced a masterful display to beat the former world number seven Bencic and reach the third round of a major for the first time having twice reached the second round of the Australian Open.
