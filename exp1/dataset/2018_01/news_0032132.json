Because we are going further than the law requires.”\nHe said that even though ATP would much prefer to convince reluctant potential business partners to live up to its new rules, it would ultimately be ready to exclude on tax grounds.\n“We are not doing this for fun,” Foged said, adding that ATP -- Europe’s fourth largest pension fund -- sees paying the right tax as its social responsibility.\n“We’re convinced this will not cost us money. We think this represents an investment risk,” he said.\n“If these kind of investment structures are being disallowed by the authorities then you will not get the yield you thought you would, and the yield you based your investment decision on.”\nWith the new rules, ATP aims among other things to ensure tax is paid where the value is created, and that no investments are made in jurisdictions that do not meet Common Reporting Standards or that are blacklisted by the European Union.\n$1 = 6.0803 Danish crowns Reporting by Teis Jensen; Editing by Catherine Evans\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-01-19T01:21:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-19T12:32:55.001+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
