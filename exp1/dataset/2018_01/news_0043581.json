The indicator was last that high in October 2001.\nThe Reuters consensus forecast was for a reading of 10.8.\n“Consumers in Germany are making an extremely optimistic start to 2018,” said GfK researcher Rolf Buerkl. “They see the German economy as experiencing a clear economic boom.” GfK’s sub-index measuring income expectations rose to 56.8 in January from 54.3 a month earlier. The headline consumer reading always leads the component indices by a month.\nConsumers’ willingness to buy rose to 60.4 from 57.1, a strong reading that indicates traditionally thrifty Germans are opening their purses more readily.\nReporting by Cirsten Pahlke and Paul Carrel\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-01-25T15:21:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-25T10:02:09.005+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
