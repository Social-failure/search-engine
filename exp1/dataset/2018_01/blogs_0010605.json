SHARES \nWhether you're in the market for a new pair of flip flops or Fingerlings toys, you'll likely find it in the endless aisles at Walmart. \nNow the retail behemoth has revealed its top-selling products in every state. \nWalmart looked at data from 2017 sales to determine the top 25 most popular items purchased on its website in each state, and identified \"interesting\" top-sellers. \nThe retail giant found that popular product categories included everything from school supplies to beverages to toys, with specific products ranging from utilitarian to unique.

And many appear to have a sweet tooth, like Arkansas (chocolate), Colorado (M&M's peanut chocolate candy), Delaware (spiced jelly candy), Maine (brownie mix), Missouri (Life Savers candy) and Washington (vanilla frosting). \nSome top products made sense geographically: In Wisconsin, shoppers were purchasing Green Bay Packers bath mats.

Cinnamon-flavored toothpaste was a top-selling product in New Hampshire, while coin banks made the list in South Carolina.
