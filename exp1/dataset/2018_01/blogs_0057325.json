Foxconn said it planned to invest $10 billion over four years to build a 20-million square foot plant that could eventually employ up to 13,000.\nReporting by Jess Macy Yu and Hong Kong bureau; Editing by Jacqueline Wong\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-31T08:16:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-31T08:29:55.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
