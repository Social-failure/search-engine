I mean, c’mon, that’s not my fault,” she said during an argument with the chair umpire.\n”Why do I have to play under a different set of rules? I don’t have to make myself uncomfortable because it’s ill prepared.\n“I have needs and it’s not my fault that this court is ill prepared.”\nThe American was docked a point toward the end of the second set after appearing to curse at 51st-ranked Babos.\nVandeweghe told media she was not happy about Babos getting “in her face” but the Hungarian denied trying to rile her up.\n”She always does that (loses her temper),” Babos said.\n“A couple of racquets are broken every match, this time it was I believe a time violation, but I’m not sure.\n“The second one I believe was an insult against me. If the umpire heard it then it must have been this.”\nVandeweghe became the third of four American women who made the semi-finals at last year’s U.S. Open to fall at the first hurdle at Melbourne Park on Monday.\nChampion Stephens, the 13th seed, was bundled out in three sets by China’s plucky Zhang Shuai. It was Stephens’ eighth successive defeat since her maiden grand slam triumph.\nFifth seed Williams, who lost last year’s final at Melbourne Park to her champion sister Serena, was beaten in two sets by resurgent Swiss Belinda Bencic.\nVenus praised her opponent for playing “above and beyond” but was otherwise tight-lipped and sullen during her post-match media duties.\nIsner was sent packing in four sets by unfancied local Matthew Ebden at the Margaret Court Arena while Sock slipped to a 6-1 7-6(4) 5-7 6-3 defeat to 41st-ranked Yuichi Sugita on Show Court Two.\nEditing by Peter Rutherford\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-15T11:11:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-15T11:26:40.059+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
