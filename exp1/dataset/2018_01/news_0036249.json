Reported gross margin, though, decreased 60 basis points.\nAs competition amid retailers intensifies in the U.S., they are putting increasing pressure on products manufacturers. P&G told analysts on Tuesday it is still coping with retailers buying less inventory and discounting products, which has impacted its sales.\n\"There continues to be significant retail competition [in the U.S.] which is forcing prices down to consumers,\" the company told analysts. \"While that doesn't change the price that we necessarily sell products through to these retail channels, it starts driving price points in the marketplace.\"\nNet sales in P&G's grooming business, which includes Gillette shaving, dropped 3 percent. Within the segment, shave care dropped at a mid-single-digit pace, still an improvement over last quarter , when net sales of the business fell 5 percent.\nSales in its baby, feminine and family care business, which includes Pampers diapers, dropped 1 percent. The business is pressured more broadly as the U.S. birth rate declines.\nKimberly-Clark, which competes with P&G in diapers and paper towels, on Tuesday announced it is slashing about 13 percent of its workforce globally in a bid to cut costs as sales wane. In an interview with The Wall Street Journal, CEO Tom Falk pointed to P&G's price-cutting to regain sales as part of the industry's challenge.\nP&G saw its strongest sales growth in beauty, which jumped 9 percent, and health care, which jumped 4 percent. Within health care, its oral care sales growth clocked in at the low single digits and its personal health care jumped high single digits. The Vicks owner said the latter was driven in part by an early and intense cold season.\nP&G said the recent change in U.S. tax law resulted in a net benefit of roughly $135 million in the latest period. It expects that to continue for fiscal 2018 and increase in the future.\nIt also took a provisional net charge of $628 million for the quarter, due to the new tax law.\nCore earnings per share, which excludes certain items such as the temporary impact of the tax law, were $1.19, an increase of 10 percent versus the prior year. P&G attributed this increase to a jump in net sales and a lower core effective tax rate.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-23T13:45:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-23T14:45:10.011+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
