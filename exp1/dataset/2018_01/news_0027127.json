It sends a very clear shot across the bow to Canada.”\nThe Canadian federal government “works closely with all provinces and territories to ensure their liquor distribution and sales policies are consistent with our international trade commitments,” said Pierre-Olivier Herbert, spokesman for Canada’s international trade minister.\nCanada will also give “careful consideration” to consultation requests from any WTO member, Herbert added.\nAustralia has seen exports of bottled wine to Canada almost halve between 2007 and 2016, from $224 million to $119 million, although sales to Britain and the United States, once its top export markets, have fallen by even more.\nDespite a growth in sales to China, now the top export destination, and to Hong Kong, Australian wine sales overall fell from $2.5 billion in 2007 to $1.7 billion in 2016.\nUnder WTO rules, Canada has 60 days to settle the dispute with Australia. After that, Australia could ask the WTO to adjudicate, with a view to forcing Canada to change its laws or risk trade sanctions.\nReporting by Tom Miles; additional reporting by Leah Schnurr in OTTAWA and Tom Westbrook in SYDNEY; editing by Susan Thomas and Lisa Shumaker\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-01-16T23:51:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-17T20:16:48.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
