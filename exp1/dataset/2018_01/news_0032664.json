REUTERS/Yuri Gripas/File Photo \nMoscow has long denied any such meddling. \nJ.D. Maddox, who worked as a counter-terrorism official at the State Department and CIA, cautioned that the data do not necessarily pinpoint the primary driver of a social media trend. \n“The only conclusion you can draw right now is that certain Russian accounts that have previously been associated with pushing anti-American narratives are also pushing this narrative and pushing it effectively,” said Maddox, an adjunct professor of national security at George Mason University. \nAt issue is a classified memo commissioned by Rep. Devin Nunes, the Republican chairman of the U.S. House of Representatives Intelligence Committee who last year said he was removing himself from the Trump-Russia probe. \nIn a rare joint statement, the committee’s nine Democrats called the document “a misleading set of talking points attacking the FBI” and drawn from “highly classified” documents. \nThe Republicans, they said, made the memo available to all House members in preparation for a public release “for the political purpose of spreading a false narrative and undermining” Mueller and the FBI. \nRepublicans have suggested the memo shows the FBI and Justice Department are biased against the president and, along with U.S. intelligence agencies, improperly surveilled members of Trump’s 2016 campaign. \nCurrent and former senior U.S. intelligence officials deny that they conducted any improper surveillance. Democrats on the panel think material in the memo is mischaracterized and taken out of context, said the committee source, who spoke on condition of anonymity. \nJack Langer, a spokesman for Nunes, did not respond directly to a request for comment on the Russian-linked internet activity surrounding the memo. \n“This sounds like yet another ridiculous article from Reuters,” Langer said in an email.
