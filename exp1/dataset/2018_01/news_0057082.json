Argentina is the world’s No. 3 exporter of raw soybeans and the top global supplier of soybean meal and soybean oil. \n“We will continue to assemble outside of the plants. No one is working,” Diaz said, adding that the group had a meeting scheduled with Argentina’s labor minister scheduled for Thursday. \nCargill’s local affiliate said in a statement it was restructuring its Rosario and Bahia Blanca operations and laying off a “limited group” of workers who would later be replaced. It did not mention the work stoppage. \n“The aim of this measure is not to eliminate or sub-contract jobs, but rather to ensure the continuity of operations in an effective and efficient matter compatible with the business’s new challenges,” the statement said.
