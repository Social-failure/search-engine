Some people misspoke. We are not creating a border security force at all,” he said aboard his aircraft taking him back to Washington from Canada, where he hosted a meeting on North Korea.\n“I think it’s unfortunate that comments made by some left that impression. That is not what we’re doing.”\nEditing by Robert Birsel\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-18T06:25:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-18T06:39:57.032+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
