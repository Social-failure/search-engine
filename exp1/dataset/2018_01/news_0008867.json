Over the past month California’s scenic coastline was ravaged by a series of intense wildfires that burned off vegetation. \nOn Tuesday, emergency workers using search dogs and helicopters to rescue dozens of people stranded in mud-coated rubble in the normally pristine area, sandwiched between the ocean and the sprawling Los Padres National Forest, about 110 miles (180 km) north of Los Angeles. \nA 14-year-old girl was found alive after firefighters using rescue dogs heard cries for help from what was left of her Montecito home, the Los Angeles Times reported. \n“I thought I was dead there for a minute,” the teenager Lauren Cantin, covered in mud, said after workers spent six hours rescuing her, NBC News reported.

Local rescue crews, using borrowed helicopters from the U.S. Coast Guard, worked to airlift them out, officials said. \nHeavy downpours struck before dawn on Tuesday after 7,000 residents in Santa Barbara County were ordered to evacuate and another 23,000 were urged to do so voluntarily, some of them for a second time since December.

The fires burned away grass and shrubs that hold the soil in place and also baked a waxy layer into the earth that prevents water from sinking deeply into the ground. \nSome local residents had to flee their homes due to the fires last month and again this week because of the rains.
