December 2017 Tax Legislation benefit amounts are estimated as of December 31, 2017 and may be subject to adjustment during 2018. “Underlying” results, as applicable, also exclude a 1Q17 $23 million benefit related to the settlement of certain state tax matters and reclassify 2Q17 results for the pre-tax impact of $26 million of lease asset impairments to reflect their credit-related impact. 3Q16 after-tax notable items excluded from our “Adjusted” results reflect a $19 million gain on a TDR portfolio sale less other notable items (“TDR Transaction”). Where there is a reference to “Adjusted”, “Underlying” or “Adjusted/Underlying” results in a paragraph, all measures that follow these references are on the same basis, when applicable. Current reporting-period regulatory capital ratios are preliminary.\nFourth Quarter 2017 vs. Third Quarter 2017\nKey Highlights\nFourth quarter highlights include ROTCE of 19.9% and Underlying ROTCE* of 10.4%. Underlying results* reflect revenue growth of 2% driven by strength in net interest income given continued loan growth and a three basis point improvement in net interest margin. Provision expense increased modestly from relatively low third quarter levels. Results reflect an efficiency ratio of 61%, which includes the impact of $40 million of notable expense items.\nOn an Underlying basis,* operating leverage was 1.6% and the efficiency ratio improved 91 basis points to 58.5%. Tangible book value per common share of $27.48 increased by 2%. Fully diluted average common shares outstanding decreased by 8.4 million shares.\nResults\nTotal revenue of $1.5 billion increased 3% including the $17 million benefit tied to notable items; on an Underlying basis,* total revenue of $1.5 billion increased 2%. Net interest income of $1.1 billion increased $18 million, reflecting 1% average loan growth and a three basis point improvement in net interest margin to 3.08% from third quarter levels that included a two basis point benefit tied to higher commercial loan interest recoveries. Net interest margin reflects improved yields on interest-earning assets, including the benefit of higher short-term interest rates and balance sheet optimization, partially offset by higher funding costs. Noninterest income of $404 million increased $23 million, which includes a $17 million benefit from notable items. Underlying noninterest income* of $387 million increased 2%, driven by strength in foreign exchange and interest rate products, trust and investment services fees and other income. Noninterest expense of $898 million increased $40 million, driven by the impact of notable items. On an Underlying basis,* noninterest expense of $858 million was stable, as lower other operating expense and salaries and employee benefits were offset by an increase in outsid", "external_links": ["http://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.linkedin.com%2Fcompany%2Fcitizens-bank&esheet=51745344&newsitemid=20180119005195&lan=en-US&anchor=LinkedIn&index=6&md5=32425db3e9ec982f6d361500a7c521dc", "http://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.citizensbank.com%2Fabout-us&esheet=51745344&newsitemid=20180119005195&lan=en-US&anchor=www.citizensbank.com%2Fabout-us&index=1&md5=dec04c0e70622d2fb0c3ea03597db2bf", "http://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=https%3A%2F%2Ftwitter.com%2FCitizensBank&esheet=51745344&newsitemid=20180119005195&lan=en-US&anchor=Twitter&index=5&md5=30b0cad92179bce30086afa0d52f1fbf", "http://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.citizensbank.com%2F&esheet=51745344&newsitemid=20180119005195&lan=en-US&anchor=www.citizensbank.com&index=4&md5=9813bcdc40b538cd8ddde9ddc24e544e", "http://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=http%3A%2F%2Finvestor.citizensbank.com&esheet=51745344&newsitemid=20180119005195&lan=en-US&anchor=http%3A%2F%2Finvestor.citizensbank.com&index=3&md5=497a63f2284e4c211f91915c8887703a", "http://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Fcitizensbank%2F&esheet=51745344&newsitemid=20180119005195&lan=en-US&anchor=Facebook&index=7&md5=0d958a3fef3991de63a0091cca28b9da", "http://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=http%3A%2F%2Finvestor.citizensbank.com&esheet=51745344&newsitemid=20180119005195&lan=en-US&anchor=http%3A%2F%2Finvestor.citizensbank.com&index=2&md5=d5400cc10bf925053b3847bc9aa44019", "http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180119005195/en/"], "published": "2018-01-19T14:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-19T16:03:24.005+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
