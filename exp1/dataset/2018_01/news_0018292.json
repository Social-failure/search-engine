The man appeared drunk and injured when he was arrested, police said, and he was sent to hospital. \nRitz Carlton did not immediately respond to requests for comments by phone and by email, and the South Korean consulate could not be reached as it was outside office hours. \nNo further details are immediately available. \nThe Ritz-Carlton is located on the top 15 floors of Hong Kongâ€™s tallest building, the International Commerce Centre, and overlooks the Victoria Harbour.
