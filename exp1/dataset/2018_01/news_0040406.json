But a break below 12.00 to the dollar could trigger further rand gains, he said.\nOn the equities market, South Africa’s main stock index closed up 0.68 percent at a new record-high on Tuesday and the blue-chip JSE Top-40 index ended up 0.66 percent.\nLewis Group topped gainers, rising 17.70 percent to 28.60 rand after the budget furniture retailer reported a 13.3 percent rise in same-store quarterly sales.\nGovernment bonds were little changed, with the yield for the benchmark 2026 instrument at 8.35 percent.\nReporting by Alexander Winning and Tiisetso Motsoeneng, Editing by William Maclean\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-01-24T00:32:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-24T15:15:17.022+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
