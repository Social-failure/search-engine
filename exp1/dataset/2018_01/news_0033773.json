A vote is expected again in the U.S. Senate later on Monday for a short-term spending plan.\nIt is unclear how long the SEC operations can stay open for business, though for companies with IPOs already on the road, the uncertainty comes at a awkward time while they are out raising funds from investors.\nPlayAGS is scheduled to price an up to US$184m IPO on Thursday and list on the NYSE on Friday. It is one of eight scheduled pricings in what is shaping up to be the busiest week of the year to date for new issues and the busiest January for IPO volumes in recent memory.\nA banker close to the deal said PlayAGS filed several forms with the SEC that enabled its registration to become effective and move ahead with its debut regardless of the SEC’s status.\nThe company could withdraw the request if the SEC is unaffected.\nFiling activity suggests others on the calendar this week, including Menlo Therapeutics, PagSeguro Digital and Corporación América Airports, did the same.\nThis gives these companies the flexibility to go ahead with their IPOs - or not - regardless of whether the government shutdown, though it may remain an issue for IPOs planned for the following weeks.\nAn extended shutdown may mean the SEC’s key prospectus processing divisions, including the Division of Corporation Finance, are unable to process filings, provide advice and conduct normal activities.\nNew or pending registration statements would not be processed regardless of their status, the SEC said Friday.\n“In the event that the SEC does shut down, we will pursue the agency’s plan for operating during a shutdown. As that plan contemplates, we are currently making preparations for a potential shutdown with a focus on the market integrity and investor protection components of our mission,” the SEC said.\nLaw firm Cooley was among the securities law firms that advised clients on Friday to plan accordingly ahead of the shutdown.\nReporting By Anthony Hughes\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-22T15:57:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-22T16:11:47.016+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
