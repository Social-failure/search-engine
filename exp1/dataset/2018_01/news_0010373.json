It closed up 45.3 percent, just above Novo Nordisk’s offer price of 30.5 euros per share. \nThat level suggests Ablynx investors are ready to pay a light premium in the hope of a higher rival bid or a sweetened offer by Novo. \nOptimism was palpable for M&A with brokers’ research pointing to sectoral consolidation (such as security firms) and BNP Paribas arguing the U.S. tax cuts would give a boost to deals without Europe missing out. \n“As Europe is lagging in the cycle, its potential for external growth and share buybacks is at least as good as in the U.S.,” the French bank said in a research note. \nShares in payment processor Wirecard ( WDIG.DE ) hit record highs, up 6.5 percent at 105.9 euros after the company signed new contracts and KBW’s analysts lifted their target price to 114 euros. \nThe auto sector .SXAP signed off a positive session up nearly 1 percent. \nItalian-American automaker Fiat Chrysler ( FCHA.MI ) rose about 1 percent after a note from Morgan Stanley highlighted the potential of a spin-off of its Jeep brand. \n“2018 is an extremely important year for Jeep from a product and strategic perspective, which we believe can gain investor attention and continue to unlock the discount on the stock,” analysts at the U.S. brokerage said. \nElsewhere in the sector France’s Renault ( RENA.PA ) climbed 1.5 percent, while Germany’s BMW ( BMWG.DE ), Daimler ( DAIGn.DE ) and Volkswagen ( VOWG_p.DE ) rose between 0.3 and 1.3 percent. \nMicro Focus ( MCRO.L ) plummeted close to 17 percent, leading losers on the STOXX following its half-year results, which missed some analyst expectations. \nThe British firm that bought Hewlett Packard Enterprise’s (HPE) software assets in an $8.8 billion deal said its revenue would fall 2-4 percent in the 12 months to October, after a disappointing sales performance in the acquired business in recent months. \nDialog Semiconductor ( DLGS.DE ), recently hit by investor fears it could lose its top customer Apple, fell 0.8 percent after early gains in morning trading. \nThe chipmaker reported preliminary sales of $463 million for the fourth quarter, above the upper end of its outlook range announced in November. \n“While the higher sales level is positive news, key for the investment case will be the business volume with Apple over the coming years,” said Baader Helvea analysts.
