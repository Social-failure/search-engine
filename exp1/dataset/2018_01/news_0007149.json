So we appealed.\" The appeal was filed on Dec. 29.\nA TransCanada official declined to comment.\nThe proposed pipeline has been a lightning rod of controversy for nearly a decade, pitting environmentalists worried about spills and global warming against business advocates who say the project will lower fuel prices, shore up national security and bring jobs.\nThe Trump administration granted TransCanada a federal permit for the pipeline in March, reversing a decision by former President Barack Obama to reject the project on environmental grounds. That left Nebraska - the only one of three states that had not approved a route for the line - as the final hurdle.\nTransCanada has said it expects enough commercial support to make the project viable, though it has not made a final investment decision.
