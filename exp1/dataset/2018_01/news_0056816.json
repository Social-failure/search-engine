Had he known the drugs were tainted, he would not have sent them out, Chin said.\n“This should never have happened,” he said.\nA separate jury in March found Cadden guilty of racketeering and fraud but similarly cleared him of second-degree murder over the deaths of 25 people.\nBeyond Chin and Cadden, charges were filed in 2014 against 12 other people associated with NECC. Three have pleaded guilty. A trial for the remaining nine defendants is scheduled for October.\n(This version of the story refiles to add missing Quote: mark around the word “derelict” in fifth paragraph.)\nReporting by Nate Raymond in Boston; Editing by Sandra Maler and James Dalgleish\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-31T14:04:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-31T14:16:02.008+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
