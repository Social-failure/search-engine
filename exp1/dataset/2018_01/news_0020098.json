REUTERS/Edgar Su/File Photo \nGrab has expanded to eight Southeast Asian countries and has said it is the biggest operator in the region’s third-party taxi hailing and private-vehicle hailing sector. \nThe companies will jointly develop services in Southeast Asia, including one utilising Hyundai’s eco-friendly models such as the IONIQ Electric, the two firms said in a statement. \nThey did not disclose the value of Hyundai’s investment and a spokeswoman for the automaker declined to comment further. \nGrab’s latest fundraising round, which Hyundai has joined, already includes investors such as China’s Didi Chuxing, Japan’s SoftBank ( 9984.T ) and Toyota Tsusho ( 8015.T ), the firms added. \nHyundai said on Wednesday it is considering building a car plant in Southeast Asia, possibly in Indonesia or Vietnam. \nThe company’s interest in the region has grown since a diplomatic row between Beijing and Seoul last year hurt South Korean firms that are highly reliant on the Chinese market. \nThe automaker also announced for the first time a self-driving technology partnership with Silicon Valley start-up Aurora earlier this month, a shift from its usual preference for developing technology itself.
