She said that McDonald’s will work with industry experts, local governments and environmental groups to improve packaging designs, create new recycling programs, set progress benchmarks and educate its employees and customers. \n“These goals have the potential to be transformational because no other restaurant has the scope and global supply chain of McDonald‘s,” said Tom Murray, vice president of corporate partnerships at the Environmental Defense Fund, which is one of McDonald’s partners on the waste reduction and recycling initiative. \nSuch efforts are good for the environment and for the bottom line, said Murray. “When McDonald’s began their waste reduction efforts nearly 30 years ago, the business and environmental benefits were immediate: the company saved an estimated $6 million a year.” \nMcDonald’s also has used its large size and global reach to fight the rise of dangerous, antibiotic-resistant bacteria known as “superbugs”. \nScientists and public health experts warn that using medically important antibiotics to prevent disease and speed up growth in healthy animals fuels the development of those potentially deadly bacteria. \nIn 2015, McDonald’s was the first global fast-food chain to commit to eliminating the use of those drugs from its U.S. chicken supply chain, a move that prompted most of its rivals and most major chicken suppliers to follow suit.
