Neasden’s work would be transferred to other sites in the M&S network, it said. \nThe Neasden site is run by XPO Logistics with transport operations provided by DHL. Both companies have entered into a period of consultation with the site’s 380 workers. \nM&S declined to comment on the cost of the programme. The firm guided in November that capital expenditure for the full year 2017-18 would be 300 million to 350 million pounds. \nLast week M&S disappointed investors with its Christmas trading update.
