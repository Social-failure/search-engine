She was so small and emaciated, officers at first thought she was about 10 years old. \nOn Wednesday, police and prosecutors prepared for the arraignment of each parent on nine counts of torture and 10 counts of child endangerment. \nThe couple is accused of keeping 13 offspring, ages 2 to 29, in filthy and fetid conditions, chaining some to their beds and giving them so little food the adult children were initially mistaken for minors, police said. They are believed to be the couple’s biological children, Vasquez said. \nNeighbours and family members have offered little insight into the couple’s motivations or actions. Experts have said it may have been easier for the parents to shield their children from scrutiny because they were home-schooled. \nReached by telephone Wednesday at the West Virginia home of David Turpin’s parents, his mother, Betty Turpin, said she was busy preparing paperwork and entering information into a computer to help her son. She said the family had engaged an attorney, who advised them not to speak about the case. \nOn Tuesday, Louise Turpin’s sister, Teresa Robinette, told NBC News in Knoxville, Tennessee, that she was not aware of the conditions at the family’s California home. \n“We always thought she was living the perfect life,” Robinette said of her sister. “She would tell us they went to Disneyland all the time. They would go to Vegas.” Reporting by Sharon Bernstein in Sacramento, Calif., and Suzannah Gonzales in Chicago; Writing by Sharon Bernstein; Editing by Jonathan Oatis", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-17T23:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-17T23:57:25.006+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
