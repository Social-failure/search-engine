But it could also threaten U.S. plans to stabilise and rebuild a large area of northeast Syria.\nManbij, to the east of Afrin, is part of a much larger area of northern Syria controlled by the U.S.-backed Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), led by the YPG.\nReporting by Orhan Coskun and Ercan Gurses; Writing by Daren Butler; Editing by David Dolan\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-24T13:52:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-24T14:25:30.005+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
