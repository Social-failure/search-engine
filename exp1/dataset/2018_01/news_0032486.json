Prices have risen by a third since early 2017 helped by the agreement to curb output.\n“The decision about the OPEC+ deal will be made once the information about the trend sustainability is understood. It is premature to talk about it,” Dvorkovich said, adding that a decision would be taken in late spring or early summer on what to do next.\nEnergy Minister Alexander Novak has said the matter of how to make a smooth exit from the output deal could be discussed by ministers from OPEC and non-OPEC producers this weekend.\nTASS news agency reported that Dvorkovich said on Friday that oil prices, which earlier this week reached $70.37 per barrel, their highest level since December 2014, could fall again.\nReporting by Jack Stubbs; writing by Vladimir Soldatkin; editing by Alexander Smith and Jason Neely\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-01-19T18:55:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-19T14:21:41.011+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
