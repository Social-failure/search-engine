They just don’t need that right now,” Feehery said. \nIn November, Republicans must defend their Senate and House majorities in nationwide midterm congressional elections, which historically produce big gains for the opposition in the first term of a new presidency. \nTrump said on Saturday after a meeting with Republican leaders that any welfare legislation should be bipartisan or wait until later in 2018 after other priorities such as infrastructure and immigration are addressed. \nRep.

REUTERS/Aaron P. Bernstein “What we will see is perhaps a more focused approach, to a work requirement, instead of a comprehensive entitlement reform initiative,” North Carolina Republican Representative Mark Meadows said in an interview. He is chairman of the House Freedom Caucus, a conservative faction. \nIn an example of what such proposals invite, Democrats quickly attacked the administration’s decision to let states proceed with Medicaid work requirements. \n“It’s really sad. ... The elderly, disabled, pregnant women and children will all suffer,” House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi told reporters. \nA person familiar with a meeting last weekend at Camp David, the president’s mountain retreat in Maryland, between Trump and congressional leaders said some participants were wary of making “welfare reform” a Republican message. \nStill, polling in mid-2017 by the Kaiser Family Foundation found 70 percent of respondents favored work requirements for Medicaid for non-disabled adults. At the same time, 74 percent said they had a favorable view of Medicaid as it is now. \nHouse Agriculture Committee Chairman Mike Conaway, a Texas Republican, said the 2018 farm bill will including tighter work requirements for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), better known as food stamps. He gave no details. \nHouse tax committee Chairman Kevin Brady, also a Texas Republican, said his panel is exploring ways to get workers who are “trapped in the welfare system ... off the sidelines.” \nRepresentative Bradley Byrne, an Alabama Republican, said safety net programs are under review by a bipartisan group he co-chairs called the Opportunity Action Caucus. He said he hoped the group this month would propose ways for “able-bodied people who are presently on one or more of our welfare programs, to go out and get the skills and training they need to get a job.” \nEditing by Kevin Drawbaugh, Jonathan Oatis and Susan Thomas\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-12T20:12:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-12T20:20:11.020+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
