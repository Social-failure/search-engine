That is, I would say, a medium-sized song (revenue-wise),” Gruss said.\nLast week, Round Hill said it had acquired Carlin Music, one of the largest of a few remaining independent music publishers in the world, with a catalog of more than 100,000 songs, including pop and rock classics such as ‘Are You Lonesome Tonight’, ‘Fever’ and ‘La Bamba’.\nThe deal was for $245 million, according to a source familiar with its terms who requested anonymity to discuss them.\nOther similar private equity funds have launched in recent years. Kobalt Capital Ltd said last November it had raised its second fund to invest in music copyright, amassing $600 million through $345 million of equity commitments plus debt.\nReporting by Joshua Franklin in New York; Editing by Nick Zieminski\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-16T15:05:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-16T15:21:59.011+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
