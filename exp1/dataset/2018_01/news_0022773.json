Only a portion of the funding was approved in the budget and additional money will have to be set aside by the end of September. \nThe focus on Africa comes as Italy is seeking to stop migrants from reaching its shores. The mostly African immigrants first cross the Sahel states to reach Libya, where they set off in boats for Italy. More than 600,000 have come in the past four years. \nThe Niger mission was announced on Dec. 28 as Italy joined France and the United States, which already have troops there, in efforts to help President Mahamadou Issoufou better control Niger’s territory and borders. \nGentiloni said the mission would “guarantee stability in the area and fight illegal trafficking of migrants”. \nSome 400 soldiers are expected to work in Libya, up from about 370, and, as a member of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, Italy will send 60 troops to Tunisia to improve border control and fight terrorism. \nThe number of troops in Afghanistan will be halved to about 750, while about 200 soldiers will be withdrawn from Iraq. \nReporting by Steve Scherer; Editing by Robin Pomeroy\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-17T18:47:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-17T19:07:16.029+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
