The remaining votes were invalid.\nHyundai did not have an immediate comment.\nReporting by Joyce Lee; Editing by Edwina Gibbs\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-01-16T08:56:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-16T03:14:49.002+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
