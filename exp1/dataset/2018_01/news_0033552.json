They have rejected demands for a shorter working week unless hours could be increased temporarily so as not to put output at risk. \nThree rounds of regional talks have failed to result in agreement. \n“A further escalation of the conflict with 24-hour warning strikes can therefore no longer be ruled out,” said Knut Giesler, head of IG Metall in North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany’s most populous state. \nHe said that employers had not presented an improved pay offer and even refused to talk about working-hour reductions as outlined by the union. \n“However, IG Metall will not come out of these talks without presenting solutions for the whole set of demands.” \nA fourth round of talks begins in the southwestern state of Baden-Wuerttemberg, home to Daimler and sports car maker Porsche, on Jan. 24. Any deal in Baden-Wuerttemberg would typically be applied in other states as well. \nIf the two sides remain at loggerheads, IG Metall’s leadership may decide at a meeting on Jan. 26 to call for 24-hour walkouts or ballot the union’s members for extended strikes. \nMore than half a million workers at hundreds of metals and engineering companies have taken part in industrial action this month to support IG Metall’s wage claim. \nOn Thursday, as talks were held in North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany’s industrial heartland, some 4,000 workers at Daimler near Stuttgart downed their tools, and over 1,000 employees of Bosch in the Bavarian town of Ansbach took action. \nForklift truck maker Jungheinrich ( JUNG_p.DE ), Thyssenkrupp’s System Engineering and elevator businesses and premium carmaker BMW ( BMWG.DE ) were also among the nearly 200 companies affected. \nSuch industrial action is common in Germany during sector-wide pay negotiations, and similar walkouts took place in 2016 and 2015.
