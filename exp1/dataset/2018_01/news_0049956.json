On Monday it sold a stake in investment firm PSG Group for 7.1 billion rand ($600 million), after securing 60 million euros ($75 million) from South African lenders the previous week.\n“It is not a uniquely South African issue but it is incredibly disappointing for that to have happened in an environment that we are so proud of,” added Newton-King.\nDespite the problems at Steinhoff, Newton-King said the “South African narrative is definitely feeling on the up,” after Cyril Ramaphosa narrowly won the race to succeed President Jacob Zuma as head of the ruling African National Congress (ANC).\n“I would think that in a more positive environment, certainly one in which people are wanting to raise capital for long term investment, both the number of IPOs and capital raised will trend in a positive direction,” she said.\nDuring his ANC party leadership election campaign, Ramaphosa - a 65-year-old former trade union leader and one of the country’s wealthiest businessmen - vowed to address record unemployment and a sluggish economy.\nMarkets have rallied since the victory of Ramaphosa who said South Africa wants to attract foreign investors to help kick-start economic growth. He has also promised to crack down on corruption.\nSouth Africa’s central bank governor, also speaking in Davos, said Ramaphosa’s appointment had removed political uncertainty that contributed to the depreciation of the rand.\n($1 = 11.8506 rand)\n($1 = 0.8028 euros)\nEditing by Keith Weir\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-01-26T17:47:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-26T11:51:21.023+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
