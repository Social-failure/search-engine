SoftBank last week secured agreements from shareholders who were willing to sell, and the deal will close early this year, Uber said.\nKalanick had offered to sell half of his total shares, but because there was a limit on how much SoftBank will buy, he will sell just 29 percent, according to the source. Other investors also did not get to unload as many shares as they had hoped because of such widespread interest to sell.\nA spokesman for Kalanick declined to comment. SoftBank could not be reached for comment.\nKalanick's share sale will earn him about $1.4 billion, the source added. The former Uber CEO is still on the board of directors.\nThe SoftBank deal values Uber at $48 billion, about a 30 percent discount from its most recent valuation of $68 billion. However, the investor consortium is also making a $1.25 billion investment of fresh funding at the older, higher valuation.\nBloomberg first reported Kalanick's plans to sell part of his stake.\n(Reporting by Liana Baker and Heather Somerville in San Francisco; Additional reporting by Philip George in Bengaluru; Editing by Gopakumar Warrier and Lisa Shumaker)", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-05T04:46:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-05T06:33:40.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
