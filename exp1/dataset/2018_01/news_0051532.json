It owns 40 percent of Saudi Arabia’s Arab National Bank ANB.\nArab Bank CEO Nemeh Sabbagh said liquidity continued to be robust and the bank’s provisions coverage ratio for non-performing loans stood in excess of 100 percent.\nThe statement said the bank’s board of directors recommended the distribution of a 30 percent cash dividend on its 2017 results.\nReporting by Suleiman Al-Khalidi Editing by Jeremy Gaunt and Louise Heavens\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-01-27T23:40:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-29T11:45:35.006+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
