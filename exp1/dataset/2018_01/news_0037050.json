He blanked Chicago 4-0 on Jan. 14. The Red Wings lost their last two games with Jimmy Howard in goal.\nMrazek became the first Wings goaltender to record back-to-back shutouts since Dominik Hasek in January 2008.\nCory Schneider stopped 27 shots for the Devils, who have lost eight of the last 10 games.\nDylan Larkin had a goal and an assist for the Wings while Tyler Bertuzzi and David Booth also scored. Andreas Athanasiou recorded two assists.\nDetroit led 1-0 after the first period. Schneider stopped Larkin’s backhander but Bertuzzi was left unchecked and knocked in the rebound 6:36 into the game.\nIt was Bertuzzi’s second career goal. His other goal came against Chicago on Jan. 14.\nThe Red Wings had a 12-11 edge in shots on goal and neither side was whistled for a penalty during the period.\nThat changed dramatically, as the teams had a combined five power plays during the second period. However, all those opportunities were wasted.\nBooth gave the Wings a two-goal lead with 1:48 remaining in the period. Jonathan Ericsson skated past the blue line and sent a short pass to Booth, whose slapshot from the point deflected off a Devils stick and over Schneider’s right shoulder. Booth increased his season total to four goals.\nMrazek robbed Brian Boyle with a skate save on a point-blank shot during a power play early in the third.\nLarkin fired in his eighth goal from the left circle at the 11:02 mark of the third to make it 3-0. The officials originally ruled no goal but changed the call after replays showed the puck hit inside the crossbar.\nForwards Justin Abdelkader, Darren Helm, Luke Glendening and defenseman Trevor Daley missed the game for Detroit due to injuries. Forwards Brian Gibbons and Taylor Hall and defenseman Mirco Mueller sat out for New Jersey.\n--Field Level Media\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-01-23T11:13:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-23T18:04:25.023+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
