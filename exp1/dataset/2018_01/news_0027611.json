The president’s tweet in February 2017 that news outlets are “the enemy of the American people” uses words “infamously spoken by Joseph Stalin to describe his enemies,” said the senator, who has been a vocal critic of the president in recent months. \nTrump said in a Jan. 7 Twitter message he planned to give out awards Wednesday to media outlets he claims are “the most corrupt & biased.” SPONSORED FINANCIAL CONTENT ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-19T01:50:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-18T16:43:54.042+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
