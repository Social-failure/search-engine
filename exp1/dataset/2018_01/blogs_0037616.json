Right now, there's no integration between the Google Home and Amazon's Audible and Google's audiobooks won't play on the Echo. While both Home and Echo integrate with a large variety of outside services, they're becoming walled gardens against each other's content. As consumers decide which speaker to purchase, they may be swayed by whichever device gives them easier access to their audiobooks, or they'll buy audiobooks from whichever company makes their speaker. \nThe company is rolling out a dedicated audiobook store on Play and the Google Play Books app works with both Android and iOS. The Play Store already sold a small selection of audiobooks, but this update makes the selection much more comprehensive and easy to sort. \nGoogle won't offer a subscription pricing plan like Audible does. Audible's cheapest subscription tier is one book a month for $14.95, which shaves as much as $10 off the price of a standalone audiobook. With Google, you can buy books only on a one-off basis. \nGoogle launches the service with a handful of big discounts on titles such as \"Why Not Me?\" by Mindy Kaling ($5.99 on Google versus $21 on Audible without a subscription) or \"Lincoln in the Bardo\" by George Saunders ($8.99 on Google versus $24.50 on Audible without a subscription). \nWhile it will take a deep-dive after the discounts expire to get a full pricing comparison, it seems that Google is trying to appeal to customers who don't read enough to want to buy into Audible's subscription model.
