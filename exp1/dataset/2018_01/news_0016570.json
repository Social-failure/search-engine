The dismal PMI reading suggests that the South African manufacturing sector ended the year on the backfoot,” analysts at Absa said.\nThe economy slipped into recession in the first quarter of 2017, due to contractions in the manufacturing, mining and retail sectors, before recovering in the following two quarters as easing drought boosted agricultural production.\nManufacturing, the fourth largest sector at 13 percent of gross domestic product, also recovered in the second half of 2017, although business activity remains below potential.\nPolitical and policy uncertainty have hampered business confidence and investment, but with the ruling African National Congress’s leadership battle concluding in victory for Cyril Ramaphosa, viewed as pro-business, confidence is seen returning.\nThe index tracking expected business conditions in six months’ time rose to 61.9 in December from 50 in November.\n“This suggests that, in the absence of any adverse shocks, the sector could perform better in 2018,” the Absa analysts said.
