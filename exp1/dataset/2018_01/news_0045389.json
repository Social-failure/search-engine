It did not give further details on what the factors were.\nHNA Investment said in March last year it had signed a framework agreement with AEP on the REIT, which will be listed in Singapore.\nHNA Investment is one of seven HNA Group units that has announced a trading halt as the parent faces rising financing costs after a two-year $50 billion acquisition spree.
