We have a system which is very price sensitive and runs with no spare capacity.\"\n\"In this context, any geopolitical event can create a price spike.\nDescalzi said he expected oil demand to expand in 2018 by around 1.3 to 1.5 million barrels per day (bpd).\n\"By the end of the year inventories may go down again by 150 to 200 million barrels and fall below the multi-year averages, and it won't be easy to push U.S. output higher at the same levels in 2019. \" Descalzi said.\n(Reporting by Dmitry Zhdannikov, writing by Ron Bousso.
