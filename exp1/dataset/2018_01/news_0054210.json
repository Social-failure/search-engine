But she gave no reason for her resignation, a month after Mugabe stepped down when the army and his ZANU-PF party turned against him. \nA copy of Chigumba’s appointment letter written by the chief secretary to Mnangagwa and his cabinet showed that Chigumba would start her new job immediately and was expected to be sworn-in on Thursday. \nA government source also confirmed her appointment. \nMnangagwa said last week the southern African country would hold transparent elections by July and he would respect the result if the opposition wins. \nChigumba’s last high-profile case was in November when she freed activist pastor Evan Mawarire, who had faced trial on charges of attempting to subvert Mugabe’s government.
