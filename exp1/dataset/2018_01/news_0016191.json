The Larapinta Trail website lists over exertion as one of the greatest risks to hikers due to the potential for dehydration. \nThe men had hiked 16 km (10 miles) before they were separated on a path that afforded little shade and were carrying limited supplies of water, according to police. \n“We live in a beautiful but harsh environment,” Nobbs said.
