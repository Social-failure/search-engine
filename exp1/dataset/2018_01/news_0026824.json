Those borders have been fortified since a migrant influx in 2015.\nKovacs added that third-country nationals could also be subject to a restraining order anywhere in the country.\nDetails were not immediately clear as the bills will only be published and submitted for public debate on Thursday.\nBut pro-government media reported that the bills could lead to a ban on Soros, who has U.S. and Hungarian citizenship, entering the country.\nSoros, 87, is a Hungarian-born Jew whose longtime support for liberal and open-border values in eastern Europe have put him at odds with right-wing nationalists, especially in Hungary.\nOrban’s government said in its position paper that it opposed migration through “every means possible.”\n“Illegal mass immigration is a problem that affects Europe as a whole, posing serious security risks,” it said.\nAsked about implications for Soros himself, Kovacs said: “If Soros is found to have engaged in such activity, meaning he organizes illegal immigration, then the rules will apply to him.” An aide for Kovacs declined to elaborate.\nLast year, the Orban government introduced a measure requiring NGOs that get money from abroad to register with the state, raising alarm in the European Union and United States.\nThe European Commission said late last year it was taking Budapest to the EU’s top court over its NGO laws as well as a higher education law that targets Central European University in Budapest founded by Soros.\nOrban is locked in a series of running battles with the EU, where Western member states and the Brussels-based executive Commission decry what they see as his authoritarian leanings, the squeezing of the opposition and the free media.\nReporting by Marton Dunai; editing by Mark Heinrich\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-17T19:17:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-17T19:29:31.003+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
