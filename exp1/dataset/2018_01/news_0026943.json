The Tribunal allows for that. We will attempt to prove that if there is any logging it is only due to people’s safety,” Kowalczyk told public radio on Friday. \nFor environmental campaigners, the words echoed those of Szyszko who said some logging had to take place to ensure the safety of people from falling trees. \nKowalczyk also said that the beetle outbreak, which environmentalists see as a pretext for cutting down trees, needed to be reduced. \nA final ruling on Bialowieza Forest by the EU’s top court is expected later this year.
