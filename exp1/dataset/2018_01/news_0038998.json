REUTERS/David Gray \nMertens, ranked 37th in the world, extended her winning streak to eight matches after defending her title at the Hobart International earlier this month. \n“It’s been amazing, the good start of the year, no words to describe this feeling,” Mertens, who was unable to participate in the Australian Open qualifying last year as she was still involved in the Hobart International, said in her on-court interview.

If you have a strong belief you can do something, you can get there.” \nThe 22-year-old ended up winning at Hobart last year for her first WTA title and finished the season in the top 40. \nShe will face either fourth seed Elina Svitolina from Ukraine or Czech qualifier Denisa Allertova in the quarter-finals.
