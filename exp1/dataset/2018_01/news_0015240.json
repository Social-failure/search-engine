With Republicans in power eager to loosen restrictions rather than tighten them, it seems unlikely the recommendations will gain traction.\nThe study recommends regulators require large banks to issue common equity equal to 23.5 percent of risk-weighted assets, roughly double what they currently hold. It also recommended a steeper leverage ratio of 15 percent.\nThe plan would also require the treasury secretary to certify that individual banks no longer pose a systemic risk. If he could say that for a specific bank, its capital requirements would automatically increase until the secretary is comfortable making that claim, either because the bank held enough capital to withstand shocks or because the institution has restructured itself to lower its footprint on the financial system.\nThe plan also recommended a tax on leverage for large “shadow banks” to ensure banking activity does not shift to more lightly regulated firms outside the traditional banking sector.\nThe Minneapolis Fed findings seemed at odds with Jerome Powell, the Fed governor who President Trump has nominated to serve as its next chair. In November, Powell told the U.S. Congress that he believed there were no U.S. banks that remained too big to fail.\nReporting by Michelle Price and Pete Schroeder; Editing by Jeffrey Benkoe\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-01-10T22:16:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-11T12:34:06.018+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
