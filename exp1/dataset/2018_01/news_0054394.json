Prices fell by 0.5 percent in the previous session.\n* FINANCIAL MARKETS: The dollar fell, remaining on track for its biggest monthly drop in nearly two years as U.S. President Donald Trump's first State of the Union address failed to offer any comfort to ailing dollar bulls.\n* FOMC: The Federal Reserve is due to release a statement at the end of its latest two-day policy meeting, at 1900 GMT. It is the last Fed meeting at which Janet Yellen will act as head of the central bank.\n* NICKEL PRICES: LME nickel led gains across base metals, closing 1.9 percent up at $13,600 a tonne.\n* NICKEL INVENTORIES: Nickel stocks in London Metal Exchange warehouses <MNISTX-TOTAL> fell another 2,280 tonnes to their lowest since September 2014, data showed on Wednesday.\n* NORNICKEL: Russia's Norilsk Nickel said on Wednesday its fourth-quarter consolidated nickel output rose 11 percent quarter on quarter to 60,032 tonnes.\n* OTHER METALS: LME zinc advanced 1.3 percent to close at $3,540 a tonne, while lead finished 0.8 percent up at $2,612 and aluminium gained 0.6 percent to $2,219.50. Tin finished 0.3 percent up at $21,680.\n* JANUARY PERFORMANCE: LME tin has surged nearly 9 percent in the month to date, while metals affected by China's winter pollution crackdown also rallied.
