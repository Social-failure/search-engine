High water means vessels do not have enough space to sail under bridges.\nThe Rhine is an important shipping route for commodities including oil products such as heating oil, grains, animal feed and coal. It is an important route for Swiss commodity imports. The river was also closed due to high water in early January.\nReporting by Michael Hogan; editing by Jason Neely\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-24T10:22:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-24T10:36:25.020+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
