The government also approved its first budget in 12 years and awarded its first offshore oil land gas exploration licences. \nIn August, Islamic State and other militants were cleared from the Lebanon-Syria border area after separate offensives by the Lebanese army and Lebanon’s powerful Hezbollah militia.

He subsequently withdrew the resignation and the government resumed business as usual.
