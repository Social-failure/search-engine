Singh has denied wrongdoing.\nSouth Africa’s parliament is investigating Eskom over allegations executives were involved in unduly awarding contracts to friends of President Jacob Zuma.\nThe utility’s chairman, Zethembe Khoza, also quit on Saturday, hours before the government named a new Eskom board, ending a power vacuum that dates back to mid-2017 when then chairman Ben Ngubane resigned and the government reversed Eskom’s decision to reinstate Brian Molefe as chief executive.\n$1 = 12.0748 rand Reporting by Nqobile Dludla; Editing by Mark Potter\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-01-24T02:17:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-24T15:19:39.012+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
