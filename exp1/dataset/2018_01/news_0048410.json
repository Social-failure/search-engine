Utah had its three-game winning streak broken.\nJackson-Cartwright’s jumper with 8:50 remaining gave Arizona (18-4, 8-1) a 65-54 lead before Utah responded to take a 66-65 lead with a 12-0 run buoyed by four Bibbins free throws and 3-pointers by Tyler Rawson and Parker Van Dyke.\nAfter the teams traded baskets, Arizona regained the lead for good on Ristic’s jumper with 2:31 remaining.\nRistic hit a 3-pointer on the next possession to make it 72-68, and his two free throws with 1:01 left boosted the advantage to 74-70.\nBibbins hit a 3-pointer with 4.3 seconds remaining to make it 74-73, and Trier ran into Bibbins and was called for an offensive foul as Arizona tried to inbound the ball, giving the ball to Utah and taking no time off the clock.\nThe Utes got the ball under the basket to Donnie Tillman, whose short shot was contested and did not draw iron. Arizona’s Keanu Pinder grabbed the rebound and was fouled with three-tenths of a second remaining.\nPinder missed the free throw, but Collette could not get a shot off after getting the rebound.\nArizona made 11 of its first 16 shots from the floor and finished with a 64.4 field-goal percentage. The Wildcats were 11th in NCAA Division I with a 50.4 percentage entering the game.\nUtah shot 44.4 percent but stayed in the game by making 18 of 21 free-throw attempts. Arizona was 6-of-11 at the line.\nThe Wildcats made 10 of 16 3-point attempts, including six of their first seven. Trier and Jackson-Cartwright had two apiece. Jackson-Cartwright has made eight 3-pointers in his past four games.\nBarefield, a starter most of the season, has scored 14, 17 and 26 points while coming off the bench in the past three games.
