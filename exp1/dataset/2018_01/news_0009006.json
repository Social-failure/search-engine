The cancer was removed surgically and found not to have spread beyond the prostate,” the source said. \nRomney would be seeking to succeed Republican Senator Orrin Hatch, who has announced he will retire rather than seek re-election. \nPresident Donald Trump had urged Hatch to run again in an apparent attempt to head off Romney, who initially opposed Trump’s presidential candidacy. Trump and Romney spoke by phone last week. A White House aide said Trump wished him well.
