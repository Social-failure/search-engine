The group on Saturday kidnapped an Ecopetrol contractor repairing damage to the Cano-Limon pipeline, also bombed by the ELN, the army said. \nPresident Juan Manuel Santos has recalled the head of the government’s negotiating team at the peace talks in Quito back to Bogota to discuss the future of talks.
