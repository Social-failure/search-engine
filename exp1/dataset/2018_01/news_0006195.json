Soccer   Tottenham Hotspur vs AFC Wimbledon - Wembley Stadium, London, Britain - January 7, 2018 Tottenham's Harry Kane scores their first goal Action Images via Reuters/Matthew Childs \nPremier League Tottenham were labouring to break down the visitors before Kane effectively sealed the tie with goals in the 64th and 66th minutes. Jan Vertonghen added his side’s third. \nWimbledon had proved stubborn opposition until a Moussa Sissoko cross found Kane who slid in to prod the ball home. \nKane made it 2-0 when he turned in an attempted shot by team mate Kyle Walker-Peters from close range. \nVertonghen fired home a spectacular third goal from distance eight minutes later for his first Tottenham goal for four years. \nAFC Wimbledon, founded in 2002 to replace the existing club that became Milton Keynes Dons and who have worked their way back up through the various leagues, came close to scoring in the first half when Jimmy Abdou’s shot hit the bar.
