Wood Mackenzie said China and India alone represent 40 percent of global demand growth.\nAsia’s demand to refine crude oil into fuel products like gasoline and diesel will average 34.5 million barrels per day (bpd) in 2018, up 630,000 bpd from the year before, Wood Mackenzie senior research analyst Joe Willis said in a media briefing in Singapore.\nTo meet this increase in demand, Asian refiners are expected to increase crude oil distillation capacity, although Willis said that the bulk of new investments would only be ready in the second half of the year.\nShould there be delays, Willis said, Asia’s fuel market would tighten, pushing up profits for existing facilities but also requiring more imports.\nSome delays have already been announced. The start-up of Vietnam’s 200,000 bpd Nghi Son refinery, for example, has been pushed back from its planned start in late 2017, said Willis.\n“If the Ngi Son refinery, or any of the other investment, is pushed back (further), we could actually see the Asian market...becoming tighter in terms of supply and demand of oil products,” said Willis.\nThe bulk of this year’s growth in oil demand will be driven by increased use of road fuels like gasoline and diesel, as well as liquefied petroleum gas used for cooking and transport, as well as in the petrochemical industry, Wood Mackenzie said.\nReporting by Roslan Khasawneh; Editing by Henning Gloystein and Kenneth Maxwell\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-30T11:14:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-30T11:30:49.007+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
