[L8N1MF2OM] \nA ban on direct international flights to and from the Kurdistan region, also imposed in retaliation for the Sept. 25 Kurdish independence referendum, is still in place. \nThe central government in Baghdad said the vote, which delivered an overwhelming yes for independence, is illegal. \nIn October, Iraqi government forces dislodged Kurdish fighters from several disputed areas including the oil region of Kirkuk.
