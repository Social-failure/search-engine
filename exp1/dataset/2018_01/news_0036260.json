As leaders we need to recognise and to act to show that truly time is up,” he said. \nOver the past two years, more than a dozen women have accused Trump of making unwanted sexual advances against them years before he entered politics. Trump has denied the accusations, and the White House has accused the women of lying. \nSince the 2016 presidential campaign, Trump has had sharply lower approval ratings among women than among men. A Pew Research Center poll in May showed 46 percent of men approving of Trump’s job performance, while only a third of women did. \nTrudeau also called on global leaders to not forget “the people who aren’t here in Davos and never will be”. \n“The people in this room are immensely privileged. We owe it to society to use this privilege for good. We should ask ourselves: do we want to live in a world where the wealthy hide in their gated enclaves while those around them struggle or do we want to create a world grounded in the notion of fairness.” \nIn his speech on Friday, Trump is expected to urge investors to take advantage of his deregulatory and tax cut policies, which his Democrat opponents describe as a giveaway to the wealthy which will widen the income gap between rich and poor. \nTrump signed sweeping tax legislation into law last year, in a bill that slashes taxes for corporation and the wealthy while giving mixed, temporary tax relief to middle-class Americans.
