The deal was terrible, the way it was structured was terrible. If we did a substantially better deal, I would be open to TPP,\" he said.\nLast January, Trump made the largely symbolic move to pull out of the Pacific trade deal championed by his predecessor, President Barack Obama. As a candidate, Trump repeatedly blasted the agreement, which had little chance of securing congressional approval even before he took office.\nJason Alden | Bloomberg | Getty Images President Donald Trump gestures as he arrives on day three of the World Economic Forum (WEF) in Davos, Switzerland, on Thursday, Jan. 25, 2018. TPP was a 12-nation agreement among the United States and Pacific rim nations designed partly to curb China's influence. Critics like Trump worried that it would encourage companies to ship jobs from the U.S. to lower-wage countries.\nTrump's populist campaign partly blamed free-trade agreements for manufacturing job losses and companies relocating outside the United States. He has also preached the benefits of bilateral trade deals rather than multilateral agreements.\n\"I like bilateral, because if you have a problem, you terminate. ... You don't have that same option\" with multilateral deals, he said Thursday.\nTrump also reiterated that he may terminate the North American Free Trade Agreement, another target of his ire, if the U.S. cannot reach what he deems a better deal during ongoing negotiations.\n\"I think we have a good chance, but we'll see what happens,\" he said of whether the U.S. would strike an agreement to stay in the three-nation deal with Canada and Mexico.\nâ€” Reporting by CNBC's Joe Kernen .\n_ CNBC's full interview of President Trump will air on \" Squawk Box \" at 6 a.m. ET Friday.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-25T20:04:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-25T20:07:41.008+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
