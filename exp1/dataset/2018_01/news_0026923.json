Both companies will continue to co-manage the joint ventures after the sale.\nCIMB-Principal Asset Management Group has more than 70 billion ringgit in assets under management.\nThe lender beat analyst expectations in its third-quarter results, recording a net profit rise of 10.7 percent for the July-September period. Malaysia’s expanding domestic economy and improving capital market and consumer spending have buoyed banks’ performance in 2017.\n$1 = 3.9850 ringgit Reporting by Liz Lee; Editing by Sherry Jacob-Phillips\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-01-11T19:28:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-12T18:45:47.030+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
