Higher installation levels around the world, the lack of threat to the solar investment tax credit, lower than expected tariff recommendation by U.S. ITC , strong debt financing activity, and over a billion dollars in securitization deals helped the solar industry have a much better year in terms of financial activity compared to 2016. After several challenging years, most of the solar securities were up in 2017 reflecting overall positive sentiments around the solar industry even as several Chinese manufacturers decided to go private. Of course, all this could change swiftly if President Trump decides to impose higher tariffs in the trade case,\" commented Raj Prabhu, CEO and Co-Founder of Mercom Capital Group.\nGlobal VC investments came to $1.6B in 99 deals in 2017, up from $1.3B in 78 deals in 2016.\nChart: Solar VC Funding 2010-2017\nSolar downstream companies accounted for $1.4B in 2017.
