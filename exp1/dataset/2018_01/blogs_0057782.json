No date is yet scheduled, but it will take place after the final divorce terms have been agreed.\nMay said it would be wrong to publish any official analysis until the terms of the deal are known, in part because doing so could prejudice the negotiations.\nReporting by William James; Editing by Nick Macfie\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-31T08:02:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-31T08:09:30.014+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
