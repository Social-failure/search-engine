The non-partisan panel included Republican members, said Knowles, who was the Democratic governor of Alaska from 1994 to 2002. \nKnowles sent a letter on Monday to Zinke to inform him of the resignations. \n“If we’re going to be ignored, we’re going to make a statement,” Knowles said by telephone. \nRepresentatives of the Department of the Interior did not respond to emails seeking comment late on Tuesday. \nAll those who resigned were appointed during the Obama administration, which ended nearly a year ago. Their terms were set to end in May, allowing Zinke to choose replacements then. \n“My sense is they’re just running out the clock,” Knowles said. \nThe concerns of the resigning panel members include climate change and the hiring of diverse candidates by the U.S. National Park Service, Knowles added. \nIn May 2017, Zinke suspended outside committees pending an internal review of the work of those panels, according to the Washington Post, which first reported the resignations. \nThe terms of two members of the panel expired this month, Knowles said. But they were not informed that they were officially off the panel, and added their names to the seven who resigned, he said.
