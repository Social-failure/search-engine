I am sorry for that.” \nSandgren continued: ”This is a tumultuous time in our political landscape It seems each issue has become polarizing and communication has broken down to the point where people refuse to talk to each other. \n“I encourage everyone to keep an open mind, to think critically and honestly.” \nSandgren encouraged people “to avoid tribalism and collectivism”. \n“I have not always practiced this in the past, and for that I am sorry,” he said. “I will do better moving forward.” Reporting by Gene Cherry in Salvo, North Carolina,; Editing by Christian Radnedge", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-28T00:07:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-28T00:21:18.004+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
