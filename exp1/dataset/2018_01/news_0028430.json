Twelve percent were neither satisfied or dissatisfied.\nThe figures mirrored the same trend in Duterte’s trust rating, which bounced back to “excellent” in December in the SWS survey, from “very high” three months before.\nThe Duterte administration’s rating exceeded the previous record of +66 achieved by the administration of former President Benigno Aquino in June 2013.\nIt got “very good” scores in five of 18 “performance subjects” rated, such as fighting terrorism, helping the poor, infrastructure development, foreign relations and providing jobs, SWS said.\nPresidential spokesman Harry Roque said, “This excellent public confidence will continue to motivate the president and his team to continue working hard to lay down the foundations for a peaceful and prosperous nation.”\nThe administration got “good” scores in 11 subjects, including defending territorial rights and protecting human rights, but scored low in fighting inflation and solving the traffic problem, the SWS said.\nReporting by Enrico dela Cruz; Editing by Martin Petty and Clarence Fernandez\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-18T10:46:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-18T11:19:15.004+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
