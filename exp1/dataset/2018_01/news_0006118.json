It competes with larger companies such as Alteryx Inc ( AYX.N ), which went public last year.\nLike many traditional software companies, Datawatch, which was founded in 1985, has been shifting its business model from selling software for large upfront payments to monthly subscription fees. This change can often result in a bumpy financial performance.\nDatawatch trades at a revenue multiple of roughly 2.0, below the 3.7 average for the enterprise software and IT services sector, according to Thomson Reuters data.\nDatawatch was the target of an activist investor campaign by hedge fund Potrero Capital in 2016. Potrero had urged the company in a presentation in March 2016 to hire a financial adviser to pursue strategic alternatives. The company later reached an agreement with Potrero Capital and added a new director to its board. That director, Charles Gillman, has since left the board.\nDatawatch narrowed its net loss to $4 million in fiscal 2017, from a net loss of $14.63 million a year earlier. Annual revenue rose 19 percent to $36.26 million from $30.46 million a year ago.\nIts shares rose nearly 70 percent in 2017. Datawatch fell 2.7 percent to close at $9.20 on Thursday.\nReporting by Liana B.
