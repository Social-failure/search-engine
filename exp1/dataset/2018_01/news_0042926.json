The average balance of commercial real estate loans increased by $176.4 million to $3.03 billion from the third quarter of 2017, resulting in a $2.2 million increase in interest income, while the average balance of consumer real estate loans increased by $29.4 million to $1.21 billion for the same period, resulting in a $345,000 increase in interest income. Interest income earned on commercial and industrial loans declined by $402,000 for the quarter ended December 31, 2017 compared to the third quarter of 2017, primarily due to $295,000 in unamortized loan origination fees that were recognized as interest income during the third quarter of 2017 on the payoff of an energy loan, with no comparable transactions occurring during the fourth quarter of 2017, as well as a $5.0 million decrease in the average balance of the commercial and industrial loan portfolio during the fourth quarter of 2017. Interest income earned on Warehouse Purchase Program loans increased by $125,000 from the third quarter of 2017, due to a nine basis point increase in the average yield, which offset an $11.0 million decrease in the average balance during the fourth quarter of 2017. Interest income on loans for the fourth quarter of 2017 included $529,000 in accretion of purchase accounting fair value adjustments on acquired loans, which included $151,000 on acquired commercial real estate loans, $74,000 on acquired commercial and industrial loans, $2,000 on acquired construction and land loans and $302,000 on acquired consumer loans.\nThe $6.1 million increase in net interest income compared to the fourth quarter of 2016 was primarily due to a $10.9 million increase in interest income on loans, which was driven by increased volume in the commercial real estate, commercial and industrial and consumer real estate loan portfolios, as well as higher yields earned on the commercial and industrial portfolio and Warehouse Purchase Program loans. The average balance of commercial real estate loans increased by $431.8 million from the fourth quarter of 2016, resulting in a $5.6 million increase in interest income. The average balance of commercial and industrial loans increased by $181.4 million from the fourth quarter of 2016, while the average yield earned on this portfolio increased by 20 basis points for the same period, resulting in a $3.2 million increase in interest income. The average balance of consumer real estate loans increased by $154.1 million compared to the fourth quarter of 2016, which offset a six basis point decline in the average yield and led to a $1.6 million increase in interest income. Despite a $91.1 million decline in the average balance compared to the prior year period, interest income on Warehouse Purchase Program loans increased by $886,000 due to a 64 basis point increase in the average yield earned for the fourth quarter of 2017, compared to the same quarter last year.\nInterest expense for the quarter ended December 31, 2017 increased by $413,000 compared to the linked quarter, which was primarily due to higher average deposit and borrowing rates, as well as increases of $53.9 million and $50.4 million in the average balances of savings and money market and interest-bearing demand deposits, respectively, compared to the third quarter of 2017. A $170.3 million decrease in the average balance of borrowings was partially offset by a 19 basis point increase in the average rate paid for borrowings, resulting in a $270,000 linked-quarter decrease in interest expense on borrowed funds.\nCompared to the fourth quarter of 2016, interest expense for the quarter ended December 31, 2017 increased by $5.5 million, primarily due to higher average deposit and borrowing rates, as well as increases of $224.9 million and $86.9 million in the average balances of savings and money market and interest-bearing demand deposits, respectively, compared to the fourth quarter of 2016. A $193.3 million decrease in the average balance of borrowings from the fourth quarter of 2016 was partially offset by a 73 basis point increase in the average rate, resulting in a $1.3 million year-over-year decrease in interest expense on borrowed funds.\nThe net interest margin for the fourth quarter of 2017 was 3.78%, a seven basis point increase from the third quarter of 2017 and a ten basis point increase from the fourth quarter of 2016. The average yield on earning assets for the fourth quarter of 2017 was 4.53%, a nine basis point increase from the third quarter of 2017 and a 33 basis point increase from the fourth quarter of 2016. The cost of deposits for the fourth quarter of 2017 was 0.64%, up three basis points from the linked quarter and up 21 basis points from the fourth quarter of 2016.\nNon-interest Income\nNon-interest income for the fourth quarter of 2017 was $6.9 million, a $5.3 million decrease from the third quarter of 2017 and a $5.4 million decrease from the fourth quarter of 2016. Gain (loss) on sale and disposition of assets for the fourth quarter of 2017 included a $3.9 million write-down on a foreclosed property. Service charges and other fees decreased by $1.2 million from the third quarter of 2017, which was primarily due to a $541,000 decrease in title premiums and a $358,000 decrease in commercial loan fee income (consisting of syndication, arrangement, non-usage and pre-payment fees). The Company recognized $1.6 million in net gains on the sale of mortgage loans held for sale during the fourth quarter of 2017, which included gains recognized on $46.7 million of one-to four-family mortgage loans that were sold or committed for sale during the fourth quarter of 2017 and fair value changes on mortgage derivatives and mortgage fees collected, compared to $2.0 million in comparable net gains recorded during the third quarter of 2017 on $52.4 million of one-to four-family mortgage loans sold or committed for sale.\nThe $5.4 million decrease in non-interest income from the fourth quarter of 2016 was primarily due to a $3.1 million loss in gain (loss) on sale and disposition of assets due to the above-mentioned write-down on a foreclosed property recorded in the fourth quarter of 2017, compared to a $407,000 loss on the sale of a foreclosed property recorded in the fourth quarter of 2016. Service charges and other fees decreased by $1.8 million, which was driven by a $695,000 incentive payment received from Mastercard in the fourth quarter of 2016 for 2015 transaction performance, a $577,000 decrease in commercial loan fee income (consisting of syndication, arrangement, non-usage and pre-payment fees), and a $544,000 decrease in title premiums. Net gains on the sale of mortgage loans held for sale during the fourth quarter of 2017 decreased by $456,000 compared to the fourth quarter of 2016, which included gains recognized on $57.8 million of one-to four-family mortgage loans that were sold or committed for sale and fair value changes on mortgage derivatives and mortgage fees collected during the 2016 period, compared to $46.7 million for the fourth quarter of 2017.\nNon-interest Expenses\nNon-interest expense for the quarter ended December 31, 2017 was $40.7 million, a $413,000 increase from the third quarter of 2017 and a $1.2 million increase from the fourth quarter of 2016. Occupancy and equipment expense increased by $477,000 compared to the third quarter of 2017, primarily resulting from an early termination fee collected from a tenant in the third quarter of 2017. Data processing expense increased by $450,000 on a linked-quarter basis as the Company transitions to outsourcing certain segments of its data processing, while advertising expense increased by $422,000 due to a higher number of events and sponsorships compared to the linked quarter. These increases in non-interest expense were reduced by a $1.0 million decrease in salaries and employee benefits expense from the third quarter of 2017, which was primarily driven by lower health care costs, as well as a reduction in performance incentive accruals based on increased non-performing assets, and were partially offset by decreased deferred salary costs related to loan originations that will be accounted for over the lives of the related loans.\nThe $1.2 million increase in non-interest expense from the fourth quarter of 2016 was primarily related to a $746,000 increase in data processing expense as the Company transitions to outsourcing certain segments of its data processing and a $411,000 increase in outside professional services expense related to higher consulting and legal costs.\nFinancial Condition - Loans\nGross loans held for investment at December 31, 2017, excluding Warehouse Purchase Program loans, grew $31.6 million from September 30, 2017, which included growth in commercial real estate, commercial and industrial and consumer real estate loans. Commercial real estate and commercial and industrial loans at December 31, 2017 increased by $2.8 million and $18.7 million, respectively, from September 30, 2017, and consumer real estate loans increased by $15.5 million for the same period. These linked-quarter increases were partially offset by a $4.7 million decline in construction and land loans and a $771,000 decline in other consumer loans.\nCompared to December 31, 2016, gross loans held for investment, excluding Warehouse Purchase Program loans, grew $584.0 million, which included growth in commercial real estate, commercial and industrial and consumer real estate loans. On a year-over-year basis, commercial real estate, commercial and industrial and consumer real estate loans increased by $348.9 million, $122.1 million and $138.5 million, respectively. These year-over-year increases were partially offset by declines of $17.0 million and $8.5 million in construction and land and other consumer loans, respectively.\nAt December 31, 2017, Warehouse Purchase Program loans increased by $26.7 million compared to September 30, 2017 and by $99.2 million compared to December 31, 2016.\nReserve-based energy loans, which are secured by deeds of trust on properties containing proven oil and natural gas reserves and included in the Company's commercial and industrial loan portfolio, totaled $531.7 million at December 31, 2017, up $4.9 million from $526.8 million at September 30, 2017 and up $4.5 million from $527.2 million at December 31, 2016. In addition to reserve-based energy loans, the Company has loans categorized as \"Midstream and Other,\" which are typically related to the transmission of oil and natural gas and would only be indirectly impacted from declining commodity prices. At December 31, 2017, \"Midstream and Other\" loans had a total outstanding balance of $15.4 million, down $12.4 million from $27.8 million at September 30, 2017 and down $23.6 million from $39.0 million at December 31, 2016.\nFinancial Condition - Deposits\nTotal deposits at December 31, 2017 increased by $7.3 million from September 30, 2017, which included growth of $139.7 million and $106.6 million in interest-bearing demand and non-interest-bearing demand deposits, respectively. These increases were partially offset by declines of $232.4 million and $6.6 million in savings and money market and time deposit balances, respectively.\nCompared to December 31, 2016, total deposits increased by $402.2 million, which included growth in all deposit categories with the exception of time deposit balances, which declined by $514,000. Non-interest-bearing demand and interest-bearing demand deposits increased by $251.7 million and $126.1 million, respectively, while savings and money market deposits increased by $25.0 million from December 31, 2016.\nCredit Quality\nAt or For the Quarters Ended\n(unaudited)\nDec 31, 2017\nSep 30, 2017\nDec 31, 2016\n(Dollars in thousands)\nNet charge-offs\n$\n2,643\n$\n12,347\n$\n242\nNet charge-offs/Average loans held for investment, excluding Warehouse Purchase Program loans\n0.16\n%\n0.78\n%\n0.02\n%\nNet charge-offs/Average loans held for investment\n0.14\n0.67\n0.01\nProvision for credit losses\n$\n3,743\n$\n7,157\n$\n7,833\nNon-performing loans (\"NPLs\")\n94,403\n76,915\n111,389\nNPLs/Total loans held for investment, excluding Warehouse Purchase Program loans\n1.42\n%\n1.16\n%\n1.84\n%\nNPLs/Total loans held for investment\n1.21\n0.99\n1.56\nNon-performing assets (\"NPAs\")\n$\n102,835\n$\n90,500\n$\n122,227\nNPAs to total assets\n1.13\n%\n1.00\n%\n1.46\n%\nNPAs/Loans held for investment and foreclosed assets, excluding Warehouse Purchase Program loans\n1.54\n1.36\n2.01\nNPAs/Loans held for investment and foreclosed assets\n1.32\n1.17\n1.71\nAllowance for loan losses\n$\n71,301\n$\n70,044\n$\n64,576\nAllowance for loan losses/Total loans held for investment, excluding Warehouse Purchase Program loans\n1.07\n%\n1.06\n%\n1.06\n%\nAllowance for loan losses/Total loans held for investment\n0.91\n0.90\n0.91\nAllowance for loan losses/Total loans held for investment, excluding acquired loans & Warehouse Purchase Program loans 1\n1.14\n1.13\n1.18\nAllowance for loan losses/NPLs\n75.53\n91.07\n57.97\n1\nExcludes loans acquired in the Highlands and LegacyTexas transactions, which were initially recorded at fair value.\nThe Company recorded a provision for credit losses of $3.7 million for the quarter ended December 31, 2017, a decrease of $3.4 million from the quarter ended September 30, 2017 and $4.1 million from the quarter ended December 31, 2016. The decrease in provision expense on a linked-quarter basis was primarily related to $11.9 million in charge-offs recorded during the third quarter of 2017 on the resolution of two reserve-based energy relationships, while the decrease in provision expense on a year-over-year basis was primarily due to increased qualitative factors that were applied during the 2016 period related to some negative migration in asset quality during the fourth quarter of 2016.\nThe below table shows criticized (rated \"special mention\") and classified (rated \"substandard\" or \"doubtful\") loans at December 31, 2017, September 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016.\nDec 31, 2017\nSep 30, 2017\nDec 31, 2016\nLinked-Quarter\nChange\nYear-over-Year\nChange\n(Dollars in thousands)\nCommercial real estate\n$\n30,656\n$\n28,187\n$\n7,972\n$\n2,469\n$\n22,684\nCommercial and industrial, excluding energy\n15,496\n16,300\n13,316\n(804)\n2,180\nEnergy\n27,665\n27,754\n141,794\n(89)\n(114,129)\nConsumer\n1,409\n1,491\n2,120\n(82)\n(711)\nTotal criticized (all performing)\n$\n75,226\n$\n73,732\n$\n165,202\n$\n1,494\n$\n(89,976)\nCommercial real estate\n$\n3,893\n$\n7,094\n$\n8,446\n$\n(3,201)\n$\n(4,553)\nCommercial and industrial, excluding energy\n1,295\n14,516\n17,215\n(13,221)\n(15,920)\nEnergy\n11,352\n25,589\n—\n(14,237)\n11,352\nConstruction and land\n—\n—\n86\n—\n(86)\nConsumer\n2,823\n2,391\n2,559\n432\n264\nTotal classified performing\n19,363\n49,590\n28,306\n(30,227)\n(8,943)\nCommercial real estate\n4,134\n4,064\n5,195\n70\n(1,061)\nCommercial and industrial, excluding energy\n25,579\n14,548\n19,088\n11,031\n6,491\nEnergy\n58,424\n51,012\n67,576\n7,412\n(9,152)\nConstruction and land\n—\n—\n11,385\n—\n(11,385)\nConsumer\n6,266\n7,291\n8,145\n(1,025)\n(1,879)\nTotal classified non-performing\n94,403\n76,915\n111,389\n17,488\n(16,986)\nTotal classified loans\n$\n113,766\n$\n126,505\n$\n139,695\n$\n(12,739)\n$\n(25,929)\nAt December 31, 2017, the allowance for loan losses allocated to the Company's $547.1 million energy loan portfolio totaled $20.7 million, while the allowance for loan losses allocated to the Company's $38.0 million corporate healthcare finance portfolio totaled $3.4 million.\nConference Call\nThe Company will host an investor conference call to review the results on Wednesday, January 24, 2018 at 8 a.m. Central Time.

These forward-looking statements are based on current beliefs and expectations of the Company's management and are inherently subject to significant business, economic and competitive uncertainties and contingencies, many of which are beyond the Company's control. In addition, these forward-looking statements are subject to assumptions with respect to future business strategies and decisions that are subject to change.\nThe following factors, among others, could cause actual results to differ materially from the anticipated results or other expectations expressed in the forward-looking statements: the expected cost savings, synergies and other financial benefits from acquisition or disposition transactions might not be realized within the expected time frames or at all and costs or difficulties relating to integration matters might be greater than expected; changes in economic conditions; legislative changes; changes in policies by regulatory agencies; fluctuations in interest rates; the risks of lending and investing activities, including changes in the level and direction of loan delinquencies and write-offs and changes in estimates of the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses; the Company's ability to access cost-effective funding; fluctuations in real estate values and both residential and commercial real estate market conditions; demand for loans and deposits in the Company's market area; fluctuations in the price of oil, natural gas and other commodities; competition; changes in management's business strategies; changes in the regulatory and tax environments in which the Company operates, including the impact of the \"Tax Cuts and Jobs Act\" (the \"TCJA\") on the Company's deferred tax asset, and the anticipated impact of the TCJA on the Company's future earnings; and other factors set forth in the Company's filings with the SEC.\nThe factors listed above could materially affect the Company's financial performance and could cause the Company's actual results for future periods to differ materially from any opinions or statements expressed with respect to future periods in any current statements.\nThe Company does not undertake - and specifically declines any obligation - to publicly release the result of any revisions which may be made to any forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date of such statements or to reflect the occurrence of anticipated or unanticipated events.
