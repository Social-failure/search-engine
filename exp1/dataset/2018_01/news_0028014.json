Revenue from all “strategic imperatives” rose 17 percent.\nTotal revenue increased 3.6 percent to $22.54 billion, beating analysts’ average estimate of $22.06 billion.\nIBM swung to a loss of $1.05 billion from a year-ago profit of $4.50 billion, due to a $5.5 billion tax reform-related charge. Its adjusted profit of $5.18 per share beat estimates by a penny.\nThe company’s adjusted gross margins of 49.5 percent fell short of market expectations of 50.8 percent.\nIBM shares were down 3.4 percent at $163.40 in extended trading.\nReporting by Pushkala Aripaka and Sonam Rai in Bengaluru; Editing by Maju Samuel and Savio D'Souza\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-19T00:25:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-19T00:56:23.004+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
