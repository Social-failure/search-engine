Lee, said, adding that such a bill helps to strengthen two-way ties. \n“We won’t stop making efforts because of any intervention or interruption by outside forces,” he added. \nWhen still U.S. president-elect in December 2016, Donald Trump angered China by taking a congratulatory phone call from Taiwan’s president Tsai Ing-wen and by questioning the United States’ long-held “one China” policy. \nTrump later re-affirmed U.S. commitment to the policy in a telephone call with Chinese president Xi Jinping.
