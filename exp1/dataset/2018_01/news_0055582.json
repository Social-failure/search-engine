It causes severe watery diarrhoea, which can lead to dehydration and even death if untreated.\nReporting by Nyasha Nyaungwa; Editing by Joe Brock and Andrew Heavens\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-31T20:05:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-31T20:45:06.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
