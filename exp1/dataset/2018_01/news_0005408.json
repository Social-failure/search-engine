Material stocks are likely to buoy the Australian market, riding on a rally in metal prices. The local share price index futures rose 0.1 percent or 8 points to 6,030, a 31.3-point discount to the underlying S&P/ASX 200 index close. The benchmark edged 0.1 percent lower on Tuesday. New Zealand's benchmark S&P/NZX 50 index rose 0.2 percent at 2117 GMT on its first day of trade in the new year.
