Other parties then refused to back its proposed cabinet, mainly because Babis is facing an investigation into alleged subsidies fraud. He denies any wrongdoing.\nThe government must now resign but it will remain in office -- possibly for weeks or even months -- while Babis seeks an agreement with other parties that could back a new ANO administration, with or without Babis at the helm.
