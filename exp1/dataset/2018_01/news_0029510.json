In one week in November last year, about 110 reindeer were killed by eight freight trains in Norway.\nMostly in the Arctic north, Sami indigenous people farm reindeer to sell meat and skin. Climate change, with more frequent freezes and thaws of winter pastures, has put pressure on reindeer numbers there as well.\nInterest for wind farms in Norwayâ€™s south has risen in recent years. In 2017, the country licensed the construction of two onshore wind farms in the area, with a total combined capacity of 141 MW.\nNorway has a power production surplus and is a net exporter to the Netherlands and its Nordic neighbors. About 99 percent of its domestic energy needs are fed with electricity generated in its hydropower dams.\nReporting by Lefteris Karagiannopoulos; editing by Mark Heinrich\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-19T15:44:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-19T16:12:02.003+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
