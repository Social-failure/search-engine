REUTERS/Issei Kato \nTo have the chance to banish that memory so soon in another grand slam final will make Cilic dangerous on Sunday. \n”I definitely think him winning the U.S. Open, it gave him great belief,“ Federer said. ”I like his attitude. He’s very professional. On the court, he’s a winner. \n“He’s there to win and not just to be there. Sometimes you see other players you feel like they’re happy to have made the quarters. I think he strives for more.” Slideshow (4 Images) \nCilic, whose powerful serve and tree-chopping forehand will be the key to his chances, says Sunday’s showdown is not a chance of revenge for what happened at Wimbledon. \n“I think I played great tournament so far with my level of tennis,” the 29-year-old, bidding to become the first Croatian with multiple grand slam titles, said. \n“I think everything is in good, solid spot. I‘m really excited about the final.” Related Coverage Factbox: Roger Federer versus Marin Cilic \nHe will start as the underdog though as the apparently ageless Federer chases yet more records. \nShould Federer win he would join Novak Djokovic and Roy Emerson with the most Australian Open titles and would equal Rod Laver’s record of claiming four grand slams after turning 30. \nAsked what it would mean to claim a record-extending 20th grand slam title, Federer said: “Twenty times special. It would be amazing. I‘m happy I‘m still around, still healthy, still playing good, giving myself chances, playing the best.” Editing by Peter Rutherford", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-27T12:21:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-27T12:32:52.009+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
