The fans were furious. But they cheered up a bit after eating the pizza.” \nReuters tried to contact the club by telephone, but they could not be reached for comment. \nPortuguesa were once one of the biggest clubs in Sao Paulo but have fallen on hard times since being relegated from the national league’s Serie A in 2013. \nThey fell to Serie D last year and are struggling in the second division of the Sao Paulo state championship. \nTuesday’s defeat leaves the club in 12th place in the 16-team table with only four points from a possible 15.
