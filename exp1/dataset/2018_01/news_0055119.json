It had been ruled by a two-party dynasty until an upset in the 2014 vote that brought to power Solis, a center-left academic who had never held elected office.\nUnder Costa Rican law, Solis is barred from seeking immediate re-election.\nReporting by Enrique Andres Pretel; Writing by David Alire Garcia; Editing by Michael Perry\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-31T07:59:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-31T08:11:27.007+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
