This (La Quinta) is really familiar to what I‘m used to playing,” said Rahm, who played his university golf in the adjacent state of Arizona.\nIt was not such a great day for another former Arizona State University product Phil Mickelson, who made two late bogeys for a mediocre two-under 70 at La Quinta.\nReporting by Andrew Both in Cary, North Carolina. editing by Ed Osmond\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-19T01:59:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-19T02:15:25.017+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
