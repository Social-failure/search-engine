REUTERS/Fabian Bimmer \nIndustrial output jumped 3.4 percent, the strongest increase since September 2009, the statistics office said. This compared with the mid-range forecast in a Reuters poll for a rise of 1.8 percent. \nSeasonally adjusted exports rose by 4.1 percent on the month while vibrant domestic demand pushed up imports by 2.3 percent, separate data from the statistics office showed. \nThe exports figure beat expectations for a 1.2 percent rise while imports also came in stronger than the forecast for a 0.8 percent increase. \nThe seasonally adjusted trade surplus widened to 22.3 billion euros (£19.7 billion) from 19.9 billion euros in October. The November reading was higher than the Reuters consensus forecast for a surplus of 20.9 billion euros.
