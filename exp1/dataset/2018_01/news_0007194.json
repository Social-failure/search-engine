Mandatory Credit: Kyle Terada-USA TODAY Sports \nThe only man to land five quad jumps in competition -- a quad refers to four spinning revolutions in the air -- Chen won the Grand Prix final in Japan on Dec. 8 and his class was on full display again on Thursday. \nHe made a confidence-boosting start by landing a quad flip-triple toe combination, and followed it up with an equally impressive quad toe. \nOnly on his final jump, a triple Axel, did he falter, stumbling upon landing but managing to regain his balance without touching his hand on the ice. \nThe U.S. championships offer a final chance for the men to impress selectors before three are named for the Pyeongchang Games. \nIn the pairs short program on Friday, the husband-and-wife duo of Chris and Alexa Knierim took the lead as they look to lock down the only U.S. berth on offer for South Korea. \n“So far it wouldn’t have gone any better,” said Alexa. \nThe championships continue with the women’s free skate on Friday night.
