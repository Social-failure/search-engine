Slideshow (2 Images) \nFourth-quarter sales rose 4.3 percent at constant currencies, more than twice the pace of growth seen in the first nine months, thanks to an improving U.S. market. \nNorth America, where Luxottica owns retail chains LensCrafters and Sunglass Hut, is the biggest market for the Milanese group, accounting for 60 percent of group sales in 2016. \nHowever, when factoring in the weakness of the U.S. dollar and other currencies against the euro, fourth-quarter sales were down 2.3 percent year-on-year and the annual rise thinned to 0.8 percent. \n“The fourth quarter of 2017 was the best of the year for the wholesale business, retail comparable store sales, Sunglass Hut performance in its main geographies and e-commerce sales,” Luxottica said. \nSame-store sales were flat in the fourth quarter compared to 2016 after declining sharply in the previous quarter due to an overhauling of LensCrafters’ business model. Sales at the chain continued to drop, albeit by less, in the fourth quarter. \nSince returning, in 2014, at the helm of the group, Luxottica Chairman Leonardo Del Vecchio has overseen a restructuring of the business he founded as well as a string of management changes. Luxottica lost in December its fourth CEO in three years.
