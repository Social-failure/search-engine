(NASDAQ:IDRA) stockholders concerning the proposed merger of the company with BioCryst Pharmaceuticals, Inc.

On a proforma, fully diluted basis, Idera stockholders will own 48.4 percent of the combined company.\nIf you own Idera shares, have information, would like to learn more about these claims, or have any questions concerning this announcement or your rights or interests with respect to these matters, please contact Brandon Walker or Melissa Fortunato by email at investigations@bespc.com , or telephone at (212) 355-4648, or by filling out this contact form .
