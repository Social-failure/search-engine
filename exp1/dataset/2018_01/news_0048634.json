Wema Bank and Unity Bank each fall more than 8 percent. \nThe central bank said on Monday it wouldn’t hold a meeting to set interest rates due to its inability to form a quorum. \nTraders had hinged this year’s rally on hopes of a stable currency and lower interest rates driving corporate earnings.
