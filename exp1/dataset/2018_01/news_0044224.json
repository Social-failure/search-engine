Best has commented that the Credit Ratings (ratings) of Kommesk-Omir Insurance Company JSC (Kommesk-Omir) (Kazakhstan) remain unchanged following the company’s announcement on 15 January 2018 of its agreement with another non-life Kazakh insurer, JSC Salem Insurance Company , to acquire part of the latter’s underwriting portfolio. The business to be transferred mainly comprises compulsory motor third-party liability, which is Kommesk-Omir’s largest line of business, as measured by gross and net written premiums.\nA.M. Best expects Kommesk-Omir’s rating fundamentals to remain unchanged by this transaction, which should be finalised in the first quarter of 2018. The company’s risk-adjusted capitalisation, as measured by Best’s Capital Adequacy Ratio, is expected to remain at the strongest level over the medium term.\nThe impact of the transaction on the company’s underwriting risk and operating performance is likely to be limited, as Kommesk-Omir does not plan to renew the majority of the transferred policies. In addition, the potential mispricing risk associated with the underlying policies is partially mitigated by the nature of this business, as the National Bank of Kazakhstan sets rates and other policy terms for compulsory business. Based on the terms of the agreement and the loss experience of the acquired business in 2017, the transaction is expected to be profitable for Kommesk-Omir.\nThis press release relates to Credit Ratings that have been published on A.M.
