The contract for the deal was signed Tuesday at the World Future Energy Summit in Abu Dhabi.\nACWA Power President and CEO Paddy Padmanathan said the deal represented the company's first investment in Egypt.\nThe projects' construction will begin in the first quarter of 2018, with operations slated to commence in the fourth quarter. ACWA Power said that the facilities would power 80,000 homes and save 156,000 tons of carbon dioxide annually.\nChint Solar CEO Chuan Lu described Egypt as a \"growing market where significant change is happening in the renewables industry.\"\nChina seems to be forging an ever-closer relationship with renewable energy in Egypt. Last September, for example, the Beijing-headquartered Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank announced as much as $210 million in debt financing in order to \"tap\" the renewable energy potential of the country.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-17T15:07:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-17T14:31:11.004+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
