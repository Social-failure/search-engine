Fellow OPEC member Algeria has estimated output of 1 million bpd.\nReporting by Maher Chmaytelli and Ahmed Rasheed; Editing by John Stonestreet and David Goodman\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-01-07T22:27:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-08T00:23:18.001+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
