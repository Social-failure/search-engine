Definitely, it left some scars on his body.” \nAn agitated Edmund took a medical time-out after losing the first set and slowed noticeably in the third, labouring in vain to keep pace with Cilic’s baseline missiles. \nIt was a deflating ending for a match that began with promise when the 23-year-old came out in a blaze of shot-making to grab break points off the Croatian. \nThe rangy Cilic had all the replies, however, and studiously avoided Edmund’s bazooka forehand as much as he could. \nGiven little latitude to work on his favoured side, a frustrated Edmund unravelled in the sixth game. He slapped a backhand into the net tape and the rebound sent it wide, allowing Cilic the first service break. \nThere was no tightness in the Cilic’s game, and he calmly broke Edmund again, wrapping up the set in 35 minutes with a rocketed forehand to the corner. \nEdmund had only a single forehand winner to that point and he exited the court for a medical time-out. \nHe returned still troubled of mind, and shouted “No!” at himself after bashing into the net when serving at 2-1. \nThe Briton lost his temper at 15-0 in the following game, arguing with the umpire heatedly over a line call on Cilic’s serve. \n“Get the referee, I‘m not having it,” he snapped before being flat-batted by the second match official. \nThe blow-up seemed to help as he served out to love and kept snapping at Cilic’s heels all the way to a tiebreak. \nBut from there the big Croatian played with sublime control, ratcheting up the pressure with an overhead smash and landing a pinpoint serve out wide to have three set points in a hurry. \nEdmund saved one but moments later Cilic was roaring in celebration, after lacing a backhand winner down the line to move within a set of the final. \nIt looked bad for Edmund, who began hobbling in vain pursuit of Cilic’s raids on his backhand. \nAt 1-1, having been tossed around like a rag doll across the court, Edmund was broken again, slicing a weak retrieve into the net. \nCilic quietly pumped his fist as the crowd was subdued and he quietened the terraces further by breaking the Briton again at 4-2. \nAn 11th ace and a volley put Cilic a point from the finish before he wound up his serve one last time to put Edmund out of his misery.
