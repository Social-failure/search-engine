Looters plundered a lorry carrying corn, a food collection centre, and a state-run supermarket, according to Paparoni, and a vet who witnessed the mayhem. \nA video on social media also showed around a dozen men running into a lush pasture, chasing a cow, and then apparently beating it to death. \n“They’re hunting. The people are hungry!” says the narrator of the video, who filmed the incident from his car. Lawmaker Paparoni said some 300 animals were believed to have been killed. Reuters could not verify the information. \nZuley Urdaneta, a 50 year-old vet in Merida, witnessed the looting of a lorry along the highway around 2 p.m. on Thursday afternoon. About two hours later, he said some 800 people converged on a food collection centre and proceeded to plunder it. \n“They knocked down the gates and looted flour, rice, cooking oil, cooking gas,” said Urdaneta. “The police and the National Guard tried to control the situation by giving out what was left.” \nLooting has been increasing in the provinces since Christmas, with food shortages and hyperinflation leaving millions of people hungry, though the capital, Caracas, has so far been largely unaffected. \nThe opposition says Maduro’s failed economic policies and rampant corruption are to blame for the meltdown in the once booming country home to the world’s largest crude reserves. \n“What we’re living is barbaric,” said opposition lawmaker Juan Guaido in a tweet referencing the slaughter the cattle. “The dehumanizing regime of Nicolas Maduro is turning a blind eye to the tragedy that we Venezuelans are living.” \nMaduro’s government accuses political opponents and business-friendly foreign powers of trying to foment a social uprising against him by stoking inflation and hoarding food. \nIn what they said was an attempt to combat “speculation,” authorities last week forced over 200 supermarkets to slash prices, creating chaos as desperate Venezuelans leapt at the chance to buy cheaper food. \nSome supermarkets were sold out of fruit and vegetables, and staff were unsure if the shelves would be replenished.
