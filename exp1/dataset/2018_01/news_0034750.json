Slideshow (9 Images) \nWozniacki secured victory when Suarez Navarro hit long and she will meet Belgian Elise Mertens for a place in the final. \n“I knew it wasn’t going to be that easy ... In the second set I had the chance to close it out so I was disappointed I didn’t do that,” Wozniacki, who made the semi-finals in 2011, said on-court. \n“I‘m just proud that I managed to stay cool and finish it off in the third set,” she added. “(Mertens) has had an amazing start to the year. It’s going to be a tough one but I‘m excited for it.” Editing by Ed Osmond", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-23T17:08:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-23T17:26:24.026+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
