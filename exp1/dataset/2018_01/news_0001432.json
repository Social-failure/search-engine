But his state's bid for a new Amazon headquarters is comparatively light on tax incentives. \n\"We're never going to offer $7 billion of incentives,\" Hickenlooper said, referencing a high-priced bid from New Jersey . \n\"This is one of the most desired locations for young professionals in America,\" he said. \"And over the long term, that's going to be much more powerful — whether [Amazon gets] a puny billion dollars here or billion dollars there.\" \nHickenlooper touted the state's universities, engineering talent and commitment to the environment — just a few of the positive factors that bumped Denver to a C+ grade on CNBC's report card . \nThe commonly cited drawbacks — crumbling infrastructure, chief among them — are actively seeing improvement, he said. \n--CNBC's Scott Cohn contributed to this report.
