Only the Congolese diaspora was left, and registration for them would start in July, he said. \n\nFILE PHOTO: President of Congo's electoral commission (CENI), Corneille Nangaa, speaks after a Reuters interview in his office at Gombe Municipality of the Democratic Republic of Congo's capital Kinshasa, May 12, 2017. REUTERS/Robert Carrubba “CENI is working to ensure the elections happen on December 23,” he said. \nKabila, who has been in power since his father was shot dead in office in 2001, denies clinging to power and has blamed the schedule slipping on problems registering voters in the vast, heavily forested country. \nCompleting registration is a major step toward the election going ahead, although it is unclear to what extent this will soothe tensions among a skeptical populace. \nKabila’s opponents suspect him of seeking a referendum to change Congo’s constitution to enable him to run for more than two terms, as the leaders of neighboring Uganda, Rwanda and Congo Republic have. In a press conference on Friday, Kabila declined to confirm or deny this, as in the past. \nReporting by Amedee Mwarabu; Writing by Tim Cocks; Editing by Gareth Jones\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-31T21:09:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-31T21:25:03.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
