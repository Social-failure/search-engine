That would be more than twice the European average with which the European Central Bank wants to bring Italian lenders in line. \nDaily la Repubblica reported last month Intesa was under pressure by the ECB and was considering a spin-off of the bad loan unit and a sale of a 10-15 billion euro portfolio. \nBloomberg News on Wednesday reported the unit could be worth 500 million euros. \nSales of bad debts are normally carried out at a loss because market prices, although rising on good demand, are still below book values. \nIntesa said any sale would not affect its pledge to pay out 3.4 billion euros ($4.1 billion) in cash dividends this year. \nTo help cushion losses from disposals, several lenders - including in December Banca Carige ( CRGI.MI ) - have spun off units which would require investments they can ill afford. \n“In 2018 I expect more of these ‘carve out’ deals, in which banks sell their bad loan platforms,” said Roberto Sergio, who heads bad loan think-tank Credit Village after selling the debt collector he founded to Polish group KRUK KRU.WA. \nForeign investors have been snapping up debt recovery firms in Italy, whose banks sit on 300 billion euros in soured loans. \n“The string of acquisitions has left very few possible targets on the market, while banks’ bad loan units can provide buyers with precious skills.” Additional reporting by Gianluca Semeraro, editing by Alexander Smith and David Evans", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-10T18:03:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-10T18:59:47.028+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
