Until now, there was no date set for the launch.\n\nThe Falcon Heavy has suffered multiple delays. Last year, Musk admitted that the development of the rocket had been \"way harder\" than he had anticipated.\nFor the test flight, the rocket will not carry a customer's payload. Instead, Musk will launch an original Tesla Roadster playing David Bowie's \"Space Oddity\" into \"a billion year elliptic Mars orbit.\" Musk is also CEO of Tesla .\nSpaceX does have some customers for the Falcon Heavy lined up, however. These include satellite firms Arabsat and Inmarsat , and the U.S. Air Force. There are no concrete dates for these launches.\nThe Falcon Heavy test will take place at the Kennedy Space Center's Launch Complex 39A.\nSpaceX has been ramping up its launches. The company's rockets are able to take a payload to space then land back on a droneship in the sea so they can be reused . SpaceX said that this reduces the cost of flights and allows it to do more frequent launches. It aims to launch a payload every two weeks.\nThe company is currently gearing up to launch a classified U.S. government payload codenamed \"Zuma\" this weekend.", "external_links": ["https://www.instagram.com/p/BdjBHqdAIzs/"], "published": "2018-01-05T12:04:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-05T11:45:20.058+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
