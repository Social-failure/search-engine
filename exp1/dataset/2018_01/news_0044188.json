S&P said that taxpayer and employment concentration from the new Amazon headquarters, although unlikely, could pose a long-term risk to the winning government’s credit quality.\nAmazon has said it expects to pick a location this year.\nReporting By Karen Pierog; Editing by Daniel Bases and Grant McCool\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-26T00:12:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-26T00:30:09.014+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
