The sale is expected in the second half of 2018.\nSaudi officials have said that in addition to Riyadh, they may list Aramco on one or more foreign markets such as New York, London and Hong Kong, which would spread the burden of the IPO and reduce the strain on the Saudi market.\nBut after more than a year of deliberations, a decision on a foreign market has not been announced and some officials have suggested Aramco might list in Riyadh alone.\nThere is concern in Saudi financial circles, however, that the IPO could be too large for the local market to absorb.\nThe SPA report did not say whether the CMA’s study should look at the impact of listing Aramco in Riyadh alone, or scenarios in which it was listed in Saudi Arabia as well as foreign markets.\nThe Saudi market only has a capitalisation of about $470 billion, meaning it could be destabilised by Aramco’s listing if other stocks are sold heavily to raise funds for investment in the oil company.\nThe Saudi exchange’s chief executive Khalid al-Hussan told Reuters this month that Riyadh hoped to be the only venue for the Aramco listing and could handle all of the IPO. Liquidity would not be a problem, he said.\nThe Shura Council and the Capital Market Authority had no immediate comment when contacted by Reuters on Wednesday.
