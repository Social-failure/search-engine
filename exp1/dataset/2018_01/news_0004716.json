In 2016, 38 such parastatals ran losses totalling $270 million, according to a report from the president and cabinet office last October.\nNational airline Air Zimbabwe, which runs four aircraft, is sitting on a more than $300 million debt pile while railway operator National Railways of Zimbabwe recently received a $400 million recapitulation from South Africa’s Transnet.\nPower utility Zesa Holdings has struggled since 2000 to generate enough electricity to meet demand and power outages have hurt businesses in recent years, according to the Confederation of Zimbabwe Industries (CZI).\nIn 2016, Zesa suffered a $224 million loss due to higher electricity import costs and because it is selling power at below cost.\nZimbabwe is also selling off its shareholdings in several other companies, including bankers, ZB Holdings and Agribank as well as insurer, Zimre Holdings, which has operations in several regional countries.
