SIMPLE WORKAROUND \nTravis Tygart, chief executive of the U.S. Anti-Doping Agency (USADA), said there was a simple workaround for the collection bottles and no major changes were needed for the Winter Olympics, which begin on Feb. 9 in South Korea. \n“I think the simple solution for the Games is that they just don’t freeze any of the samples until the full analysis is completed,” Tygart told Reuters in a telephone interview. \n“Based on what we understand that will cure this problem.” \nThe bottles are used to collect and store urine and/or blood samples when an athlete undergoes a doping control test. \n“What we have been able to verify is it is a very rare occurrence in the bottle caps, and it happens to some bottles but not all,” Tygart said. \n”When those bottles are frozen for a period of time at less than -5 degrees Fahrenheit, the caps can come loose. \n“If the bottle has been frozen, and the cap is one of the rare ones that becomes unsealed, that may have created a technicality for a doped athlete to walk,” Tygart said. \n“On the one hand it is extremely frustrating,” he said of the problems with the bottles, “but on the other, it is a good thing when potential holes in the global anti-doping system are exposed so that they can be fixed.” \nThe manufacturer, Berliner Special AG, told the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) it was unable to replicate the issue when the security bottles were handled according to the product’s instructions, WADA said. \nWADA added that it would be updating relevant stakeholders shortly on what its investigation had found.
