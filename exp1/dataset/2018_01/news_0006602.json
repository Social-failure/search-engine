REUTERS/Jonathan Ernst/File Photo \nLetterman, 70, left his job as host of “The Late Show” in May 2015, saying he wanted to spend more time with his family after more than 30 years on late night television. \nHis return to television for Netflix was announced in August 2017, when the quick-witted host said that Pope Francis and President Donald Trump would be top of his wish-list for the series. \nNetflix said the new series would consist of 60-minute episodes centered around “one extraordinary figure whom Dave finds fascinating” and that the interviews would take place both inside and outside a studio setting. \nThe company, home to shows such as “House of Cards” and “Stranger Things,” streams to most countries in the world and has a customer base of about 115.6 million. \nThe company’s shares have kept pace with its user growth and have risen nearly 60 percent in the past one year.
