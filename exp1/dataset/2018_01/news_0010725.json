To that end, our officials are developing a Continuity Bill for Scotland,” said a letter signed by Scotland’s Brexit negotiator Michael Russell and parliamentary business minister Joe Fitzpatrick. \nThe letter to Scotland’s parliament said their first preference was to negotiate assurances and safeguards from the British government over May’s plan. But, if those talks failed to produce a compromise, they would probably seek to start legislating on their own plan in February. \n“The purpose of introducing the bill is to ensure that Scotland’s laws can be prepared for the effects of EU withdrawal even if it does not prove possible to rely on the UK Bill,” the letter said.
