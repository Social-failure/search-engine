So far Intel is not aware of exploits based on the two vulnerabilities. \nChips potentially affected date back more than five years, with some products listed on Intel's website about the vulnerabilities having been introduced as far back as 2008. \nIntel shares fell 2.4 percent as of mid-day on Thursday to $44.17. \nResearchers have demonstrated that certain AMD and Arm-based chips are also affected by the vulnerabilities. Cloud providers, operating system vendors and other technology companies have been busy responding with product updates. \n\"System updates are made available by system manufacturers, operating system providers and others,\" Intel said. \n-- CNBC's Ari Levy contributed to this report.
