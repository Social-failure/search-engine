Flood damage in the city then cost about 1 billion euros ($1.23 billion), according to the OECD. \nSix metres is still well below the level where it would pose danger to residents. The river reached a record high of 8.6 metres in 1910, when thousands of Parisians had to flee flooded low-lying areas of the city.
