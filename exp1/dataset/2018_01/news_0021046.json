The guys have worked hard, they have toiled a little bit when they have had to,” Gibson said.\n“Once you get over the disappointment of seeing a very brown pitch, it looks more Indian than Centurion, you have to work out what lines and lengths you want to be bowling.\n“The first innings I thought we were perhaps a little bit wide but today we made the adjustment and brought the stumps into play and it has worked out for us.”\nDebutant seamer Lungi Ngidi bagged the key wicket of Kohli for five in the second innings with a ball that jagged back and kept low, trapping the Indian captain lbw.\nHe has figures of 2-14 in India’s second innings and is likely to be a handful again on the final day.\n“He is very exciting, like I said before the test match I had heard a lot of good things about him. Mark Boucher and a lot of other good cricket brains speak very highly of him,” Gibson said. “He has come in and settled very well.”\nSouth Africa won the first match of the three-test series by 72 runs in Cape Town.\nReporting by Nick Said, editing by Ed Osmond\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-16T18:55:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-16T19:34:34.004+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
