The trend of corn prices becoming stronger was also beyond market expectations ... It is expected that farmers in the northeast are likely to grow more corn in 2018,” Tang said.\nThe fall in China’s corn stocks was likely to accelerate in 2018, he added.\nChina may also import more sugar, cotton and oilseeds in 2018, putting pressure on domestic prices of some products, while prices of beef, mutton and other livestock products are expected to rise, but should be relatively stable, he said.\nWholesale pork prices in China fell 14.6 percent in 2017 from the previous year, to 21.24 yuan ($3.31) per kilogram, Tang said.\nPrices of fresh agricultural products including vegetables are unlikely to rise significantly during the Spring Festival holiday, in the absence of extreme weather, he said.\nFruit and vegetable prices in major cities in central and northern China surged earlier this month after severe winter weather cut off highways and damaged crops\n$1 = 6.4225 Chinese yuan renminbi Reporting by Hallie Gu and Josephine Mason; editing by Richard Pullin\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-01-17T14:17:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-18T16:26:41.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
