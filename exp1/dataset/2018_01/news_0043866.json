IndoAgri said on its website that it has a sustainable palm oil policy which ensures human rights are respected.\nBusinesses are facing increasing pressure from governments and consumers to disclose what actions they are taking to ensure their supply chains are free from modern-day slavery.\nIndonesia is the world’s largest palm oil producer but it has been regularly linked to the destruction of rainforests and wildlife habitats, as well as displacement of indigenous communities.\nIndoAgri is a subsidiary of Indonesian food manufacturer Indofood, which produces PepsiCo’s snacks in Indonesia under a joint venture partnership. The joint venture sourced palm oil from IndoAgri.\nThe investigation was carried out by San Francisco-based Rainforest Action Network (RAN), Indonesian labor rights group OPPUK and Washington-based International Labor Rights Forum.\n“After years of denial, PepsiCo has admitted to the high risks associated with its palm oil supply chain and business partner,” RAN campaigner Robin Averbeck said in a statement.\nPalm oil, used in soap, cosmetics and food spreads, has been one of the fastest expanding crops in the last few decades.\nReporting by Beh Lih Yi @behlihyi, Editing by Katy Migiro.
