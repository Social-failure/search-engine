They haven’t started to deploy capital in this industry, but they will.” \nThe Series C fundraising comes as California this month became the sixth U.S. state, and by far the most populous, to permit the sale of cannabis products of all types to customers at least 21 years old, venturing beyond just medical marijuana. \nHowever, just three days after California formally launched its commercial market for recreational marijuana, the U.S. Justice Department rescinded an Obama administration policy that had eased enforcement of federal marijuana laws in states that legalized the drug. \nKennedy said there had so far been little noticeable impact from the government action, but that his firm is looking more at deploying its capital in markets outside the United States. \n“It is in part due to the uncertainty in the U.S.,” he said. \nKennedy predicted the global market for recreational and medicinal cannabis - the size of which he estimates at roughly $300 billion globally - will grow in 2018, with additional countries permitting its medical use and Canada set to become the second country after Uruguay to legalize recreational marijuana. \nSeattle-based Privateer said it will use the new funds to expand its brands to new markets and make further acquisitions. \nPrivateer, which was backed in 2015 by the investment firm founded by venture capitalist Peter Thiel, has disclosed ownership in companies including online cannabis database Leafly and cannabis brand Marley Natural.
