The Company's therapeutics have broad applicability across a wide range of indications, including solid tumours and infectious diseases, and can access a far wider range of targets than typical antibody-based therapies. Immunocore has demonstrated compelling single-agent efficacy with its lead programme, IMCgp100, in a solid, 'cold', low mutation tumour of the kind which is challenging for most currently available immuno-oncology therapeutics to address. This programme is in pivotal clinical studies as a monotherapy for the treatment of patients with metastatic uveal melanoma. Immunocore also has a pipeline of wholly-owned and partnered products in development. Partners include Genentech, GlaxoSmithKline, AstraZeneca and Lilly. Immunocore is headquartered near Oxford, UK, with offices near Philadelphia, USA. The Company is privately held by a broad international and private investor base.
