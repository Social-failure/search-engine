On Monday it also announced its latest retooled product: “clean” chicken wing sauce. \nPanera founder and Chairman Ron Shaich said industry peers had approached the company for help in cleaning up their menus. “We thought it was time to formalize that advice,” he said. \nShaich said the service would help end “clean washing,” where companies reformulate a product like chicken nuggets to be more natural and then serve it with dipping sauces made from unnatural or unhealthy ingredients. \nPanera did not say how many consultants it would hire or how many clients had signed up for the service. \nPrivately held JAB Holding bought Panera in July in an all-cash deal valued at around $7.5 billion, including debt. JAB also owns Caribou Coffee, Peet’s Coffee & Tea and Keurig Green Mountain, which on Monday said it planned to buy soda maker Dr Pepper Snapple Group Inc ( DPS.N ) in a deal worth more than $21 billion. \nPanera has led other public health efforts ranging from disclosing calorie counts on menus to curbing purchases of meats raised with medically important antibiotics.
