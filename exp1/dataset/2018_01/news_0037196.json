McEachran won with 96.40 while Goepper was third with 93.20.\nThe U.S. women’s team, however, was still to be decided after Sunday’s competitions with Maggie Voisin the only athlete to have previously qualified.\nCaroline Claire made a strong case to be added to the team after her third place finish on Sunday, which marked the 17-year-old’s first Olympic qualifying podium after she scored an 85.00 on the first of her two runs.\nShe finished behind Norway’s Tiril Sjaastad Christiansen of Norway and Sweden’s Jennie-Lee Burmansson.\nTaylor Lundquist also made her case to be named to the U.S. team with a fifth place finish in the World Cup event.
