The bank’s ambition is to achieve a yearly increase in dividend.\nNordea, the Nordic region’s biggest bank, said operating profit in the quarter fell to 796 million euros ($991 million)from 1.25 billion a year ago, below an average forecast of 900 million in a Reuters poll of analysts.\nNordea said low market volatility and reduced exposure to Russia, shipping and oil had impacted earning negatively.\n“We are not satisfied with the development in profit during the latter part of 2017,” Nordea said in a statement.\nNordea said it was confident that net profit would grow in 2018, and that it expected to see slightly higher revenues, lower costs and a stable credit quality.
