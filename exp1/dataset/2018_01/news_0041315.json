Above $10 billion.”\nTotal reported net profit of $8.2 billion for 2016, with earnings helped by cost cuts made due to a prolonged downturn in the price of oil.\nThe company is expected to report 2017 net profit of $10.5 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S estimates.\n“We must not lose that discipline on cost. I always say we cannot control oil prices but can only control our costs,” said Pouyanne.\n“Today, oil is at $70 per barrel because of strong demand. However, demand also depends on price, thus, if the price goes higher we could see demand weaken. At $70, we’ll see U.S. producers re-launch their machines. Output will rise again and could hit prices again,” added Pouyanne.\nTotal bought the oil and gas business of Danish company A.P. Moller Maersk in a $7.45 billion deal which Total said would strengthen its operations in the North Sea and raise its output to 3 million barrels per day by 2019.\nThe Maersk deal is set for completion by the first quarter of 2018.\nReporting by Bate Felix and Benjamin Mallet; Writing by Sybille de La Hamaide; Editing by Gus Trompiz/Sudip Kar-Gupta\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-01-25T20:25:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-25T23:04:27.032+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
