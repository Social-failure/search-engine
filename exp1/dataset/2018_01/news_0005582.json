The Mega Millions drawing has a $281-million payout if the winner or winners select a lump-sum payment.\nU.S. lottery players will get another shot at becoming super rich on Saturday night, when numbers are drawn for the Powerball jackpot of an estimated $570 million, the fifth largest in the game's history.\nThe two jackpots together topped $1 billion after going months without a winner.\nSaturday's 10:59 p.m. EST Powerball drawing has an estimated $358.5-million lump-sum payment, according to organizers.\nThe total of the two lotteries is the third largest in the history of the games.\nLong odds have not halted the spread of \"lottery fever,\" with people lining up to buy the $2-tickets at retailers, said Jeff Lenard, spokesman for the National Association of Convenience Stores, whose members sell about 60 percent of the nation's lottery tickets.\n\"There's definitely more traffic,\" Lenard said.\nAmericans spent $80.5 billion on lottery games last year, according to the North American Association of State and Provincial Lotteries.\nPowerball tickets are sold in 44 states, and Washington, D.C., Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands. Mega Millions tickets are offered in the same locations, excluding Puerto Rico.\nThe largest Powerball jackpot was a $1.6-billion payout split among winners in California, Florida and Tennessee in January 2016, the association said. The largest Mega Millions jackpot of $656 million was won in 2012.\nThe totals have ballooned as no one has hit either jackpot since October. On Wednesday, there was no winner of the Powerball jackpot, worth an estimated $460 million. A day earlier, no one had matched all six numbers in a Mega Millions drawing, lottery officials said.\nThe estimated totals are before tax.\nThe odds of a single ticket hitting all six numbers in the Powerball are 292 million to 1, the Multi-State Lottery Association says. The odds of picking the right six numbers for the Mega Millions jackpot are 303 million to 1, the game said.\n\"When the jackpots reach these levels, everyone starts to daydream about what they would do if they won,\" Gordon Medenica, Mega Millions lead director, said in a statement.
