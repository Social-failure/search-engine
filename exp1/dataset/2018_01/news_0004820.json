The group’s president, Gary Shapiro, told digitaltrends.com that Pai and “his family have been subject to vicious and direct attacks and threats and any decision he makes regarding his own travel is fine with me.” \nLast month’s FCC meeting that included a vote on net neutrality was interrupted by a bomb threat prompting security officials to briefly clear the room. \nIn November, federal prosecutors filed criminal charges against a Syracuse man for allegedly threatening to kill a New York member of Congress unless he backed net neutrality. \nThe acting chair of the Federal Trade Commission, Maureen Ohlhausen, Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao and three members of the five-member FCC are scheduled to attend next week’s event. \nThe FCC voted 3-2 in December to overturn the net neutrality rules, which barred broadband providers from blocking or slowing access to content or allowing websites to pay for “fast lanes” to get their content more quickly to consumers. The text of the 524-page order was formally released late Thursday. \nNew regulations, including transparency rules for internet providers, will not take effect for at least three months. The White House Office of Management and Budget must first approve the new transparency rules before the old rules can be formally rescinded. Democrats in Congress plan to force a vote on whether to repeal the new rules.
