Sectors such as manufacturing and hotels were badly hit, she said.\nComplex rules and technical glitches meant the GST, aimed at transforming India's 29 states into a single customs union, hit millions of small businesses.\nManufacturing is now forecast to grow at 4.6 percent this fiscal year compared with 7.9 percent growth in the previous year, the statement said. Farm output may slow to 2.1 percent from 4.9 percent.\nFinance ministry officials earlier said slower economic growth was likely to hit revenue collections this year, forcing them to resort to borrow from the market to meet spending targets.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-05T16:13:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-05T16:48:38.017+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
