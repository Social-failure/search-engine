This time, the Wizards squandered a 23-point margin before holding on for the victory.\nA dunk by Caris LeVert capped a 13-3 run and pulled the Nets to within 105-104 with 1:45 remaining in regulation. After Wall missed a wide-open jumper, Brooklyn could not take advantage and turned the ball over with 16 seconds left.\nWall made a pair of free throws to provide Washington with a 107-104 lead. However, Quincy Acy answered with a 3-pointer that tied the game with nine seconds left that forced overtime.\nAn 18-foot jumper by Beal gave Washington a 114-109 lead in the extra period. Brooklyn missed its opening five shots in the overtime.\nStill, a pair of free throws by the Nets’ Jarrett Allen cut the lead to three with just over a minute left. A jumper by Wall gave Washington a 116-111 lead with 38.7 seconds remaining.\nRondae Hollis-Jefferson answered for Brooklyn with a layup. Wall then made another decisive jumper, and Washington led 118-113 with 16.6 seconds left.\nKelly Oubre closed out the game for Washington by making one of two free throw attempts in the final seconds.\nHollis-Jefferson scored 22 for the Nets, who have lost four of five games. DeMarre Carroll, Spencer Dinwiddie and Allen Crabbe had 13 points apiece for Brooklyn.\nDespite the loss, the Nets only need four wins to match last season’s total. Washington is 14-11 against teams below .500 this season. Two of those losses came against the Nets last month.\nWall, who became the youngest player in franchise history to reach 10,000 points against Orlando, did not show any ill effects from an ankle injury he suffered in that game. However, he had eight turnovers that helped keep the Nets in the game.\n--Field Level Media\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-01-14T11:16:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-14T20:28:38.002+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
