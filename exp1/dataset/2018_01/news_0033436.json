There is a committee that is formed that looks into it and whenever the decision is taken the company is ready to implement.”\nThe sale of up to 5 percent of Saudi Aramco [IPO-ARMO.SE], is a centerpiece of Vision 2030, an ambitious reform plan to reduce the economy’s dependence on oil.\nNasser said the plan remains to list the whole company rather than creating a subsidiary to IPO.\nReporting by Reem Shamseddine and Stephen Kalin; writing by Rania El Gamal; editing by Jason Neely\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-01-18T18:12:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-18T12:20:09.001+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
