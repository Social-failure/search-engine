We’ve seen a lot of firms concerned about supply chains going forward, and many have tried to secure alternative supply-chains if the President pulls out of NAFTA. But the market is just taking this in a stride now,” Brown said.\nInvestors will be looking at the fourth-quarter earnings season, which kicks into full gear on Friday with big U.S. lenders JPMorgan and Wells Fargo.\nEarnings for S&P 500 companies are expected to increase by 11.8 percent on average, with the biggest contribution from the energy sector, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.\nTechnology and industrial stocks were among the biggest gainers. Boeing rose 1.5 percent and Caterpillar gained 0.7 percent, boosting the Dow.\nApple’s 0.6 percent gain provided the biggest boost to the S&P and the Nasdaq.\nDelta Air Lines was up 1.31 percent after the company’s profit for the fourth quarter beat estimates.\nXerox shares jumped 5 percent after the Wall Street Journal reported the copier maker was in deal talks with Japanese camera maker Fujifilm Holdings that could include a change in control of Xerox.\nData showed U.S. producer prices fell in December for the first time in nearly 1-1/2 years amid declining costs for services, which could temper expectations that inflation will accelerate in 2018.\nOther data showed the number of Americans filing for unemployment increased for the fourth straight week to more than a three-month high.\nAdvancing issues outnumbered decliners on the NYSE by 1,783 to 753. On the Nasdaq, 1,552 issues rose and 883 fell.
