Reuters has reported that even before that, the company had snubbed takeover interest from private equity firms HIG Capital and Lone Star Funds.\nRent-A-Center Chief Executive Mark Speese resigned earlier this month.\nReporting by Uday Sampath in Bengaluru; Editing by Savio D'Souza\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-20T01:38:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-20T02:02:24.044+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
