It has 20 million monthly active users.\nEric Rapps, managing director of Playtika Growth, told Reuters that a “very significant majority” of the $400 million will be invested in Israel.\nThe money will be invested from Playtika’s own funds over the next four years, with the first investment expected to be made within six to 12 months, Rapps said.\n“We recognized that over the past eight years we have unique insights into how to grow an online business,” he said, adding that Playtika itself grew from a very small startup.\nReporting by Tova Cohen; Editing by Steven Scheer and Louise Heavens\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-29T11:59:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-29T12:09:24.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
