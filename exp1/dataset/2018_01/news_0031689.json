The largest foreign holder of U.S. government debt owned $1.189 trillion in October, according to the Treasury’s latest capital flows data.\nJapan, the second largest holder of Treasuries, scaled back its stake in U.S. government debt for a third straight month to $1.084 trillion. This was the lowest level since $1.083 trillion in June 2013.\nOverall foreign official institutions sold $6.7 billion in Treasuries in November. They have been unloading their U.S. government debt holdings nearly every month going back to at least 2014.\nBack in November, the Chinese yuan CNY= gained 0.36 percent versus the greenback, while the Japanese yen JPY= rose 0.97 percent against the dollar, Reuters data showed.\nThe dollar ended up 2017 with its worst annual performance since 2003 on expectations central banks besides the Federal Reserve are preparing to end the emergency policy measures they adopted to combat the 2008 global credit crisis and the recession that ensued.\nPRIVATE OVERSEAS DEMAND PERSIST While overseas central banks continued to roll back their Treasury exposure, private offshore investors have shown steady appetite for U.S. stocks and corporate bonds amid an improving global economy.\nNet overseas purchase of domestic equities totaled $12.67 billion in November, marginally higher than $12.31 billion the month before.\nTotal net purchase of corporate bonds grew to $28.7 billion, the most in at least January 2014.\nOverall offshore investors amassed $33.8 billion in U.S. securities November after buying $152.9 billion the month before.\nReporting by Richard Leong; Editing by Chizu Nomiyama and Tom Brown\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-01-18T07:48:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-18T16:02:30.003+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
