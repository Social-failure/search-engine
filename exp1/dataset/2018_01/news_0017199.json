Talks in Bavaria continue on Monday and in North Rhine-Westphalia resume on Thursday.\n$1 = 0.8365 euros Reporting by Maria Sheahan; editing by Jason Neely\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-01-12T15:26:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-13T14:44:50.024+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
