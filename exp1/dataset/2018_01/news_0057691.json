The missile attacks were believed to be carried out by members of Kurdistan Workers’ Party (PKK) and Syrian Kurdish fighters, it said.\nSince the start of Turkey’s operation against the Syrian Kurdish YPG militia in Afrin, several rockets have hit the Turkish border towns of Kilis and Reyhanli.\nTurkey launched the air and ground offensive, dubbed “Operation Olive Branch”, a little more than a week ago, opening a new front in Syria’s seven-year, multi-sided civil war to target Kurdish fighters in northern Syria.\nWriting by Ezgi Erkoyun\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-31T11:53:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-31T12:23:43.002+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
