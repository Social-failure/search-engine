It was horrible, I’ve never experienced anything like it. It was like: ‘whoops, there’s a rainworm’ and then he ate it.” \nYet Dyche suggested the former Denmark striker had fallen for a practical joke. \n“Yeah, I also smoke exhaust pipes. I have gravel for breakfast. Those three combined often are the things that keep this voice sounding how it is. It’s fair to say I didn’t actually eat the worms,” Dyche said. \n”It was a bit of banter I used to have. I’ve done it here and Watford too - that you get a nice, big juicy worm hanging out of your mouth. Look as if you’re chewing it and then spit it out, wash your mouth with water. \n“It was a bit of banter and Soren has probably taken it a bit too far, he was probably turning away at that moment. He’s a good lad,” added Dyche. \n“For the record I definitely don’t eat worms and I never did.” \nBurnley host Manchester United at Turf Moor in the Premier League on Saturday.
