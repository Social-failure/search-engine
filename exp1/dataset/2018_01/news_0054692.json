See the reconciliation of the GAAP to non-GAAP financial measures in the accompanying financial information.\nLOS ANGELES, Jan. 30, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Hope Bancorp, Inc. (the “Company”) (NASDAQ:HOPE), the holding company of Bank of Hope (the “Bank”), today reported unaudited financial results for its three months and full year ended December 31, 2017.\nThe mergers of Wilshire Bancorp, Inc. (“Wilshire”) with and into BBCN Bancorp, Inc. (“BBCN”) and Wilshire Bank with and into BBCN Bank were completed on July 29, 2016, and the combined companies commenced operations under the new banners of Hope Bancorp, Inc. and Bank of Hope, respectively, effective July 30, 2016. The 2017 financial results reflect four full quarters and a full year of combined operations. While the 2016 fourth quarter financial results reflect a full quarter of combined operations, the 2016 full-year results reflect seven months of stand-alone operations of the former BBCN and five months of combined operations. As a result, the Company’s financial results for the 2017 full year may not be comparable to financial results for the corresponding 2016 full year.\nFourth quarter 2017 financial results include a one-time, non-cash, incremental income tax expense in the Company’s consolidated statements of income of $25.4 million resulting from the revaluation of its deferred tax assets and liabilities (the “DTA”) and low income housing tax credit (the “LIHTC”) investments due to the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “Tax Act”) on December 22, 2017. This one-time, non-cash charge adversely impacted the Company’s diluted earnings per share for the fourth quarter by $0.19 per share and its tangible book value by $0.19 per share. The estimates of the impact of the Tax Act on the Company are preliminary and subject to additional procedures and analyses.\nFor the three months ended December 31, 2017, net income totaled $18.0 million, or $0.13 per diluted common share. Excluding the one-time, non-cash tax expense noted above, net income totaled $43.4 million, or $0.32 per diluted common share. This compares with 2017 third quarter net income of $44.6 million, or $0.33 per diluted common share, and 2016 fourth quarter net income of $40.6 million, or $0.30 per diluted common share.\nNet income for 2017 totaled a record $139.4 million, or $1.03 per diluted common share, based on weighted average diluted shares of 135,684,969. Excluding the one-time, non-cash tax expense, net income totaled $164.9 million, or $1.22 per diluted common share. This compares with 2016 net income of $113.7 million, or $1.10 per diluted common share, based on weighted average diluted shares of 103,530,318.\nThere were no Tax Act-related adjustments to the Company’s 2017 third quarter, 2016 fourth quarter and 2016 full-year financial results. Net income and diluted earnings per share excluding tax reform adjustments are non-GAAP financial measures. See the reconciliation of the GAAP to non-GAAP financial measures in the accompanying financial information.\n“We completed our first full year of operations as the representative bank of the Korean-American community with a solid performance on numerous fronts,” said Kevin S. Kim, President and Chief Executive Officer. “New loan originations topped the preceding quarter totaling $664 million and included another record performance from our residential mortgage operations with $193 million in new production. We saw a significant decline in nonaccrual loans during the quarter, and our outlook for asset quality remains strong. With the steady growth in our loan portfolio and improved yields for our interest-earning assets, our net interest income before provision for loan losses continued to trend positively, up 3% from the preceding quarter. While our deposit balances dipped temporarily at year-end, our average deposit balances continued to hold strong notwithstanding the extremely competitive deposit market.\n“Although the 2017 fourth quarter included several non-core items that impacted our bottom line results, most notably due to the enactment of the Tax Act, we anticipate recovering the one-time, non-cash charge by approximately the end of the third quarter of 2018 through lower quarterly tax provision expenses. We are making significant enhancements to our overall enterprise risk infrastructure, and believe Bank of Hope is well positioned to benefit from the recent tax reforms and deliver even greater returns to our shareholders, customers and employees in 2018 and beyond,” said Kim.\nFinancial Highlights\n(dollars in thousands, except per share data) (unaudited) At or for the Three Months Ended 12/31/2017 9/30/2017 12/31/2016 Net income $ 17,984 $ 44,564 $ 40,630 Diluted earnings per share $ 0.13 $ 0.33 $ 0.30 Tax reform adjustments: Deferred tax asset $ 23,835 $ — $ — Investments in affordable housing partnerships $ 1,588 $ — $ — Net income, excluding tax reform adjustments (1) $ 43,407 $ 44,564 $ 40,630 Diluted earnings per share, excluding tax reform adjustments (1) $ 0.32 $ 0.33 $ 0.30 Net interest income before provision for loan losses $ 126,392 $ 123,263 $ 117,209 Net interest margin 3.84 % 3.83 % 3.75 % Noninterest income $ 16,451 $ 16,246 $ 18,192 Noninterest expense $ 73,028 $ 61,837 $ 66,731 Net loans receivable $ 11,018,034 $ 10,879,341 $ 10,463,989 Deposits $ 10,846,609 $ 10,993,320 $ 10,642,035 Nonaccrual loans (2) $ 33,247 $ 43,323 $ 40,074 ALLL to loans receivable 0.76 % 0.76 % 0.75 % ALLL to nonaccrual loans (2) 254.28 % 193.05 % 197.99 % ALLL to nonperforming assets (2) (3) 75.69 % 66.51 % 71.32 % Provision for loan losses $ 3,600 $ 5,400 $ 800 Net charge offs $ 2,692 $ 1,841 $ 1,433 Return on assets (“ROA”) 0.51 % 1.30 % 1.20 % Return on equity (“ROE”) 3.70 % 9.26 % 8.72 % Efficiency ratio 51.12 % 44.32 % 49.28 % (1) Net income and diluted earnings per share excluding tax reform adjustments are non-GAAP financial measures.

The Company provides the following supplemental information to facilitate a better understanding of financial performance. Net interest income and operating income for the three months ended December 31, 2017, September 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016 included the following pre-tax acquisition accounting adjustments and merger-related expenses associated with past and current acquisitions:\n(dollars in thousands) (unaudited) Three Months Ended 12/31/2017 9/30/2017 12/31/2016 Accretion on purchased non-impaired loans $ 7,629 $ 4,566 $ 3,355 Accretion on purchased credit-impaired loans 5,167 5,815 5,591 Amortization of premium on low income housing tax credits (85 ) (84 ) (84 ) Amortization of premium on acquired FHLB borrowings 354 357 449 Accretion of discount on acquired subordinated debt (263 ) (262 ) (260 ) Amortization of premium on acquired time deposits and savings 3 206 3,478 Amortization of core deposit intangibles (676 ) (676 ) (742 ) Total acquisition accounting adjustments $ 12,129 $ 9,922 $ 11,787 Merger-related expenses (12 ) (260 ) (2,952 ) Total $ 12,117 $ 9,662 $ 8,835 Net Interest Income. Net interest income before provision for loan losses for the 2017 fourth quarter increased to $126.4 million from $123.3 million in the immediately preceding third quarter and from $117.2 million in the year-ago fourth quarter.\nThe net interest margin (net interest income divided by average interest earning assets) for the 2017 fourth quarter increased 1 basis point to 3.84% from 3.83% in the 2017 third quarter and increased 9 basis points from 3.75% in the year-ago fourth quarter. The increases in the Company’s weighted average yield on loans were largely offset by increases in the weighted average cost of deposits.\nThe weighted average yield on loans for the 2017 fourth quarter increased 5 basis points to 5.12% from 5.07% in the 2017 third quarter and increased 32 basis points from 4.80% in the 2016 fourth quarter. The weighted average yield on new loans originated for the 2017 fourth quarter increased 2 basis points to 4.42% from 4.40% in the 2017 third quarter and increased 27 basis points from 4.15% in the year-ago fourth quarter.\nThe weighted average cost of deposits for the 2017 fourth quarter increased 5 basis points to 0.80% from 0.75% in the 2017 third quarter and increased 25 basis points from 0.55% in the year-ago fourth quarter.\nNoninterest Income . Noninterest income for the 2017 fourth quarter increased 1% to $16.5 million from $16.2 million in the 2017 third quarter. Compared with the 2017 third quarter, the net gain on sale of SBA loans decreased to $2.6 million from $3.6 million, while the net gain on sale of residential mortgage loans increased to $1.3 million from $847,000. During the 2017 fourth quarter, the Company sold $131.2 million in securities available for sale and posted a gain of $301,000, compared with a gain on sale of securities available for sale of $0 and $2,000 for the 2017 third quarter and 2016 fourth quarter, respectively. Noninterest income for the 2016 fourth quarter totaled $18.2 million and included a $3.7 million gain on sale of SBA loan and a $1.4 million gain on sale of residential mortgage loans.\nNoninterest Expense . Noninterest expense increased 18% to $73.0 million in the 2017 fourth quarter from $61.8 million in the 2017 third quarter and increased 9% from $66.7 million in the year-ago fourth quarter. The 2017 fourth quarter reflected elevated levels of noninterest expense due to several items, which were one-time or non-core in nature. Following an analysis of its LIHTC investments on an individual investment basis as a result of the passage of the Tax Act, the Company recognized a $3.3 million LIHTC impairment during the 2017 fourth quarter. 2017 fourth quarter noninterest expense also included $2.2 million of expenses related to special projects, as well as $1.0 million in expenses following an annual reassessment of the Company’s BOLI liabilities. In addition, noninterest expense for the preceding 2017 third quarter benefited from a $2.8 million reversal of an off-balance sheet provision for unfunded loan commitments, as previously announced. The Company had no such benefit in the 2017 fourth quarter.\nSalaries and employee benefits expense for the 2017 fourth quarter increased 10% to $39.6 million from $36.0 million for the immediately preceding third quarter and increased 16% from $34.2 million for the year-ago fourth quarter. In addition to the BOLI expense noted above, salaries and employee benefits expense reflected higher costs associated with an increase in FTEs. The total number of FTEs, excluding employees on leave, as of December 31, 2017 was 1,470, up from 1,463 as of September 30, 2017 and 1,382 as of December 31, 2016.\nIncome Tax Provision . The effective tax rate for the 2017 fourth quarter was 72.8%, compared with 38.3% for the 2017 third quarter and 40.1% for the fourth quarter a year ago. Excluding the $25.4 million charge related to the revaluation of the Company’s DTA and LIHTC investments, the effective tax rate for the 2017 fourth quarter would have been 34.4%.\nAs a result of the tax reform which lowered the corporate federal tax rate from 35% to 21%, the Company expects its effective tax rate for 2018 will be in the range of 25%.\nBalance Sheet Summary\nLoans receivable increased to $11.10 billion at December 31, 2017 from $10.96 billion at September 30, 2017, reflecting a 5% annualized growth rate. At December 31, 2016, loans receivable totaled $10.54 billion.\nTotal new loan originations during the 2017 fourth quarter amounted to $663.5 million and included SBA loan production of $66.7 million and residential mortgage loan originations of $193.0 million.\nSales of SBA loans to the secondary market and gains derived from those sales are based substantially on the production of SBA 7(a) loans. SBA 7(a) loan originations represented 100% of SBA production for the 2017 fourth quarter and totaled $66.7 million. This compares with SBA 7(a) loan production of $67.9 million for the third quarter of 2017 and $62.5 million for the year-ago fourth quarter. During the 2017 fourth quarter, the Company sold $36.6 million of its SBA loans held for sale, compared with $49.9 million in the immediately preceding third quarter and $50.3 million in the fourth quarter a year ago.\nAggregate loan pay offs and pay downs in the 2017 fourth quarter declined to $380.9 million from $447.6 million for the immediately preceding third quarter and from $417.3 million in the year-ago fourth quarter.\nTotal deposits at December 31, 2017 decreased to $10.85 billion from $10.99 billion at September 30, 2017, while average balances of interest bearing deposits and noninterest bearing deposits were higher for the 2017 fourth quarter when compared with the preceding third quarter. At December 31, 2016, total deposits amounted to $10.64 billion. Noninterest bearing demand deposits accounted for 27.6%, 27.7% and 27.3% of total deposits as of December 31, 2017, September 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016, respectively.\nCredit Quality\nThe provision for loan and lease losses for the 2017 fourth quarter was $3.6 million, compared with $5.4 million for the immediately preceding third quarter and $800,000 for the year-ago fourth quarter.\nFor a more detailed understanding of the changes in the allowance for loan and lease losses (“ALLL”), the composition of the ALLL has been segmented for disclosure purposes between loans accounted for under the amortized cost method (referred to as “legacy loans”) and loans acquired through the Wilshire Bancorp, Center Financial, Pacific International and Foster Bankshares transactions (referred to as “purchased loans”). The purchased loans are further segregated between non-impaired and credit-impaired loans.\nThe composition of the ALLL as of December 31, 2017, September 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016 is as follows:\n(dollars in thousands) (unaudited) 12/31/2017 9/30/2017 12/31/2016 Legacy loans (1) $ 67,648 $ 70,282 $ 66,399 Purchased non-impaired loans (2) 4,853 2,740 814 Purchased credit-impaired loans (2) 12,040 10,611 12,130 Total ALLL $ 84,541 $ 83,633 $ 79,343 Loans receivable $ 11,102,575 $ 10,962,974 $ 10,543,332 ALLL coverage ratio 0.76% 0.76% 0.75% (1) Legacy loans include loans originated by the Bank’s predecessor banks, loans originated by Bank of Hope and loans that were acquired that have been refinanced as new loans.\n(2) Purchased loans were marked to fair value at acquisition date, and the ALLL reflects provisions for credit deterioration since the acquisition date.\nThe Company defines nonperforming loans to include delinquent loans past due 90 days or more on nonaccrual status, delinquent loans past due 90 days or more on accrual status (excluding purchased credit-impaired loans) and accruing restructured loans. Nonaccrual loans at December 31, 2017 declined to $33.2 million, or 0.30% of loans receivable, from $43.3 million, or 0.40% of loans receivable, at September 30, 2017 and $40.1 million, or 0.38% of loans receivable at December 31, 2016. Accruing restructured loans totaled $67.3 million at December 31, 2017, compared with $64.8 million at September 30, 2017 and $48.9 million at December 31, 2016.

This compares with 2017 third quarter net charge offs of $1.8 million, or 0.07% of average loans receivable on an annualized basis, and $1.4 million, or 0.05% of average loans receivable on an annualized basis, for the year-ago fourth quarter.\nThe ALLL at December 31, 2017 was $84.5 million, or 0.76% of loans receivable (excluding loans held for sale), compared with $83.6 million, or 0.76% of loans receivable (excluding loans held for sale), at September 30, 2017 and $79.3 million, or 0.75% of loans receivable (excluding loans held for sale), at December 31, 2016.

Formal guidance on the proposed Accounting Standard Update is expected to be adopted prior to the Company’s filing of its Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nTangible common equity per share and as a percentage of tangible assets are summarized in the following table:\n12/31/2017 9/30/2017 12/31/2016 Tangible common equity per share (1) $ 10.68 $ 10.72 $ 10.15 Tangible common equity per share, excluding tax reform adjustments (1) $ 10.87 $ 10.72 $ 10.15 Tangible common equity to tangible assets (1) 10.54 % 10.63 % 10.60 % (1) Tangible common equity as a percentage of equity and tangible assets, are non-GAAP financial measures that represents common equity less goodwill and net other intangible assets divided by equity and total assets less goodwill and net other intangible assets, respectively. Management reviews tangible common equity to equity and tangible assets in evaluating the Company’s capital levels and has included these figures in response to market participant interest in tangible common equity as a measure of capital. The accompanying financial information includes a reconciliation of the ratio of tangible common equity to equity and tangible assets with stockholders’ equity to total assets and a reconciliation of tangible common equity per share, excluding tax reform adjustments.\nInvestor Conference Call\nThe Company will host an investor conference call on Wednesday, January 31, 2018 at 9:30 a.m. Pacific Time / 12:30 p.m. Eastern Time to review financial results for the fourth quarter ended December 31, 2017.
