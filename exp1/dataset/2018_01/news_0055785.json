The raids were first reported by Germany’s Sueddeutsche Zeitung daily. \nAudi facilities were not searched, a spokesman at the carmaker’s base in Ingolstadt said, adding it had learnt about the raids through the media. \nAudi, a key contributor to VW group profit, developed 3.0 litre V6 diesel engines equipped with illicit emissions-control software and used in about 80,000 VW, Audi and Porsche vehicles that were found to exceed U.S. emissions limits. \nThe Munich prosecutors’ swoop coincided with similar action by their Stuttgart counterparts, who earlier on Wednesday said two employees of auto supplier Robert Bosch [ROBG.UL] were being probed over Chrysler emissions in the United States.
