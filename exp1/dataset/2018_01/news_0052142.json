( cnb.cx/2nrkjIe ) \nA spokesman at Renesas declined to confirm or deny the report, saying the company continues to explore various options for growth but that nothing had been decided. \nMaxim was not immediately available for comment. \nShares in the San Jose, California-based company ended up 12.3 percent at $66.27 on the Nasdaq on Monday after the report. \nIn 2016, Renesas beat out rival suitor Maxim in a deal to buy U.S. chipmaker Intersil Corp for $3.2 billion, an all-cash deal that bolstered the Japanese groupâ€™s efforts to refocus the company around automotive chips. \nRenesas, created from the semiconductor units of several Japanese companies, has amassed a significant war chest since a state fund and key clients bailed it out after the Fukushima earthquake in 2011.
