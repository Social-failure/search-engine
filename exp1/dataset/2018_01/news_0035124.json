REUTERS/Francois Lenoir “I am conscious of the warnings that weigh upon him, but I am also conscious of his absolute legitimacy to be candidate,” Roger Torrent said.\nCatalonia’s parliament must hold its first vote of confidence on the new leader by Jan. 31.\nMeanwhile, Spain’s Supreme Court rejected on Monday a request from the state prosecutor to reactivate a European arrest warrant to detain Puigdemont while he is in Copenhagen.\nSlideshow (2 Images) The court said it was too early to do so while Catalonia’s newly-elected parliament was not back to normal yet.\nWhile at first glance a blow to Madrid’s efforts to have Puigdemont arrested, the court’s decision could also make it more difficult for the former Catalan leader to be allowed to vote.\nSpanish laws make it easier for someone in detention than for someone who is abroad to be granted a parliamentary proxy.\nRelated Coverage Former Catalan leader Puigdemont to address situation in Catalan parliament on Tuesday In Copenhagen, Puigdemont declined to comment any further on the day’s events.\nAfter weeks of uneasy calm, the political crisis triggered by Catalonia’s independence drive flared up again last week when the new regional parliament elected Torrent as speaker at its first sitting.\nDespite that tension, Spain’s borrowing costs fell to six-week lows on Monday after credit agency Fitch upgraded its sovereign rating to gave Spain its first “A-” grade since the euro zone debt crisis.\nAccording the Danish parliament’s diary, Puigdemont has also been invited to a meeting there on Tuesday by Magni Arge, a deputy representing the Faroe Islands, which have their own independence movement seeking secession from Denmark.\nAdditional reporting by Stine Jacobsen in Copenhagen; Writing by Ingrid Melander and Sonya Dowsett; Editing by John Stonestreet\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-22T10:36:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-22T10:46:45.018+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
