Moderate senators from both parties held talks on Sunday to try to broker a deal.\nWall Street, which had been resilient to the threat of a shutdown, rose on Friday, with the S&P 500 and Nasdaq notching record closing highs. Investors shrugged off the threat last week, saying they were not worried about a major pullback in shares if U.S. lawmakers failed to strike a deal.\n“These things have no near-term or midterm economic impact whatsoever,” said Michael Purves, chief global strategist and head of derivatives strategy for Weeden & Co in New York.\n“They are kind of embarrassing for the United States, but it’s not really going to alter business or consumer confidence,” he said.\nPurves said investors should continue to favor stocks given the relative resilience of the U.S. and global economy, and avoid buying U.S. bonds as Treasury yields are likely to climb.\nFutures snapshot at 7:13 p.m. EST (0013 GMT):\n* S&P 500 e-minis EScv1 were down 4.75 points, or 0.17 percent, with 17,910 contracts changing hands.\n* Nasdaq 100 e-minis NQcv1 were down 13.25 points, or 0.19 percent, in volume of 4,519 contracts.\n* Dow e-minis 1YMcv1 were down 51 points, or 0.2 percent, with 3,972 contracts changing hands.\n* Benchmark 10-year note futures TYv1 last fell 5/32 in price.\nReporting by Megan Davies and Koh Gui Qing in New York; Editing by Peter Cooney\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-22T01:21:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-22T01:34:57.006+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
