Phoenix Police Department/Handout via REUTERS/File Photo But he faces additional murder and weapons charges, as well as one count each of a sexually motivated kidnapping and armed robbery, stemming from the seven other murder investigations still underway, police said.\nGary Beren, a lawyer listed in court records as Cooksey’s attorney in the case of his parents, could not immediately be reached for comment.\n“There are ballistic links to all of these crimes,” Howard told reporters.\nHoward said there was no known motive for the killings. The nine victims - seven men and two women - ranged in age from 21 to 56.\nAsked whether additional victims might be identified, Howard said that was “absolutely a distinct possibility.”\nApart from his mother and stepfather, police said Cooksey had a personal connection to at least one other of his alleged victims. The body of a former girlfriend’s brother was found inside a home on Dec. 11.\nCooksey has a long criminal history and served time for manslaughter and armed robbery in the past, prison records show. He is the second suspected serial killer arrested by Phoenix police in the last year. In May, police linked 12 shootings and nine deaths to a former city bus driver who has pleaded not guilty.\nEditing by Steve Gorman and Tom Brown\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-19T01:33:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-19T01:44:53.010+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
