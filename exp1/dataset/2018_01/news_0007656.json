Transition period important to minimize impact on citizens and businesses.”\nThe Netherlands is one of the top EU trading partners with Britain and a disorderly departure from the trading bloc in March 2019, without a replacement trade deal, is expected to trim several percentage points off Dutch GDP.\nRutte also repeated the backing of the Netherlands of Barnier as “sole EU-negotiator”.\nDutch economic forecaster CPB has projected a hit to the $770 billion economy of the Netherlands of up to 2 percentage points by 2030. Analysts at the Rabobank have forecast a loss of as much as 4.25 percentage points.\nIn a worst-case scenario, Rabobank estimated the loss for the Netherlands would be 4,000 euros (3,525 pounds) per worker by 2030, and 13,500 euros per British worker.\nReporting by Anthony Deutsch; Editing by Alison Williams\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-09T13:39:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-09T13:51:19.026+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
