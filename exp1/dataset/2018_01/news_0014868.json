REUTERS/Michael Kooren/File Photo Speed skating runs in Kramer’s family -- his father Yep competed in the 1980 and 1984 Olympic Winter Games -- and his experience on the ice and reputation as one of the world’s best all-round skaters make him a formidable opponent.\nIt was Kramer’s experience that led to him being named to race in the mass start for the Netherlands at the Games, much to his own surprise as he is also in the 5,000 and team pursuit.\n“That was a big surprise,” Koops said.\n“But we already saw him competing in some Dutch mass start races, and he competed in our marathon in a race of 125 laps, so he is also doing his endurance training on the marathon.”\nUnlike most speed skating events on the long track where skaters race the clock, the mass start, which is making its Olympic debut in South Korea, involves a peloton so tactics and positioning come to the fore.\n“He is used to skating in a pack,” Koops added.\n“We wanted to bring our real best skaters into the mass start and our head coach for the team pursuit and mass start decided to bring in Sven Kramer as one of the best skaters of the Netherlands.”\nThe Dutch have also named sprinter Koen Verweij to partner Kramer, so the team can have the best of both worlds in the sport’s newest Olympic event.\n“The mass start has evolved really quickly,” Koops said.\n“You see more skaters who are skating in the 1,000 and 1,500, so there’s a lot of speed in the final sprint, that’s why I think the coach made his decision on Sven and Koen Verweij.”\nEditing by Greg Stutchbury\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-01-15T22:06:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-16T13:24:48.030+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
