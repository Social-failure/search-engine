Slideshow (12 Images) \nThe race was delayed by 90 minutes due to heavy snowfall and Jansrud must have thought he clinched it after grabbing pole position and seeing Svindal trail in the upper half of the steep and narrow course. \nBut the 35-year old former Olympic champion, who won three medals including the Super G gold at the 2010 games in Vancouver but failed to finish on the podium in any event four years ago in Sochi, steamrolled through the lower section. \nSvindal will have a shot at completing the double on Saturday as he tops the downhill standings and will start as the favourite to win at the famous Hahnenkamm course.
