Our colonel is a showman through and through.” \nDespite some skepticism, relaunching the Colonel Sanders campaign in 2015 has brought KFC considerable success. A report of same-store sales growth is expected in early February. \n", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-26T07:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-26T07:01:08.015+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
