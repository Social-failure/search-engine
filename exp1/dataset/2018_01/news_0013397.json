MSCI’s all-country world stocks index also posted another record high. \nU.S. stock investors remain upbeat about fourth-quarter earnings season, which begins on Friday with results from JPMorgan Chase, with the focus expected to be on any comments related to the just-approved U.S. tax overhaul that includes hefty corporate tax cuts. \nCiti analysts say global earnings revisions have now been upgraded for 14 weeks in a row, the best run of weekly upgrades since their data series started in 2000. \n“Across the board, we’re positive about fourth quarter and the next few quarters. But it could be a little bit noisy after we got the tax reform law passed and companies make some adjustments close to year-end,” said Tim Dreiling, regional investment director for The Private Client Reserve of U.S. Bank. \nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 115.62 points, or 0.46 percent, to 25,398.62, the S&P 500 gained 8.11 points, or 0.30 percent, to 2,755.82 and the Nasdaq Composite added 11.77 points, or 0.16 percent, to 7,169.15. \nThe S&P 500 has been up every day so far in the new year, providing more optimism on the outlook for the rest of the year. \nThe pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index rose 0.44 percent and MSCI’s gauge of stocks across the globe gained 0.18 percent. \nOil prices rose, touching their highest since December 2014, supported by OPEC-led production cuts and expectations that U.S. crude inventories have dropped for an eighth week. \nU.S. crude rose 1.51 percent to $62.66 per barrel and Brent was last at $68.53, up 1.11 percent on the day. \nThe dollar rose against most other major currencies including the euro, which having approached three-year highs last week, slipped. \nThe dollar fell against the yen after the Bank of Japan trimmed its purchases of long-dated government bonds in market operations, stoking speculation the central bank could start to wind down its huge stimulus policy this year. \nThe dollar index rose 0.26 percent, with the euro down 0.37 percent to $1.1921. \nThe Japanese yen strengthened 0.39 percent versus the greenback at 112.65 per dollar, while Sterling was last trading at $1.3526, down 0.29 percent on the day. \nYields on benchmark U.S. 10-year government notes hit a 10-month high after the Bank of Japan move. \nTen-year notes last fell 16/32 in price to yield 2.5402 percent, from 2.482 percent late on Monday.
