Unemployment reached 17.5 percent in 2016, according to most recent statistics available.\nOman was rocked by Arab Spring-style protests in 2011 in which demonstrators demanded jobs, political reforms and an end to corruption. The protests subsided after authorities promised more jobs.\nWith smaller oil and financial reserves than its wealthy neighbors, Oman has spent heavily on industrial and infrastructure projects to diversify its economy beyond oil.\nThis month it announced plans to boost spending in the 2018 budget, despite increasing concern among credit rating agencies about the health of the country’s finances.\nReporting by Marwa Rashad; Editing by Sami Aboudi and Matthew Mpoke Bigg/Mark Heinrich\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-25T21:18:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-25T21:28:02.007+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
