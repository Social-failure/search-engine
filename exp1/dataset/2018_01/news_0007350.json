REUTERS/Charles Platiau “It mattered a lot for the president, even if it was very complicated to import a horse for sanitary reasons. It’s a symbol of French excellence,” an Elysee official said.\nSince his election last May, France’s youngest leader since Napoleon has shown his willingness to use symbols and history to win over his global counterparts.\nSlideshow (4 Images) Macron flattered Russian President Vladimir Putin in May with a meeting at the sumptuous palace of France’s former monarchy, built in Versailles by Louis XIV - the “Sun King” - to symbolize absolute power.\nHe also invited U.S. President Donald Trump to watch a military parade on the grandest avenue of Paris on Bastille Day last July to celebrate the 100th anniversary of the U.S. entry into World War One.\nTrump later said Macron was doing a “terrific job”.\nIn Xian, Macron decided at the last minute to visit the Wild Goose Pagoda, a virtually unknown landmark in the West compared with the terracotta soldiers but well-known by Chinese people as a historic site for Buddhism.\nThe 40-year old French president is keen to gain more access for French companies to often protected Chinese markets and is traveling with a delegation of about 50 businessmen.\nReporting by Michel Rose; Editing by Robert Birsel\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-08T08:26:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-08T08:42:21.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
