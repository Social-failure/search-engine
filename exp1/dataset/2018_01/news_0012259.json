(\"Gray,\" \"we,\" \"us\" or \"our\") (NYSE: GTN and GTN.A) announced today its appointment of veteran broadcaster Chris Fedele as the General Manager of WTVG-TV (ABC) in Toledo, Ohio. He brings over 25 years of broadcast experience to Gray Television.\nMr. Fedele, a native of Northeast Indiana, returns to the region after serving as the Director of Sales and Marketing for WLEX-TV (NBC) in Lexington, Kentucky for the past ten years. Prior to that, he spent five years as the President and General Manager of WPTA-TV (ABC) in Fort Wayne, Indiana. Mr. Fedele spent fourteen years at WPTA-TV, serving at various times as the General Sales Manager, Local Sales Manager, and National Sales Manager. He began his broadcasting career at Blair Television in New York after graduating from Ball State University in 1991.\nFor the past several years, Pete Veto has served as the General Manager of WTVG as well as WJRT (ABC) in Flint, Michigan.
