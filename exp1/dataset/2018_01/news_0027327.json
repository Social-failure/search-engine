Sainz finished 19 minutes and 37 seconds behind the Qatari.\nPeterhansel, a 13 times Dakar winner on bikes and cars, had started the day second overall but clipped a tree with his front left wheel on a bend that was hidden by a bump.\nThe impact broke a steering rod, with the support team carrying out repairs once he was out of the timed zone, and also left the Frenchman with a sprained thumb.\nThe delay meant he lost about an hour and fell behind al-Attiyah in the standings.\nToyota’s Dutch driver Bernhard ten Brinke retired with mechanical problems.\nIn the motorcycle category, Austrian KTM rider Matthias Walkner ended the day with a 22 minute lead over Argentina’s Kevin Benavides on a Honda.\nAustralian Toby Price, the 2016 winner, took his second successive stage win.\nReporting by Alan Baldwin in London, editing by Greg Stutchbury\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-20T02:19:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-20T02:32:12.003+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
