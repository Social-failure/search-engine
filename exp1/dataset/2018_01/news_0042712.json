Oil and gas grew double digits,” Chief Executive Blake Moret said on a conference call with analysts. \nThe Milwaukee, Wisconsin-based company, which in November rejected a sweetened takeover bid from bigger rival Emerson Electric Co ( EMR.N ), however, noted that it was too early to quantify the benefits of the tax reform. \nThe company said it was now targeting about $1.2 billion in share buybacks for fiscal 2018, up from a previous estimate of $500 million, adding that it would increase investments this year to “accelerate profitable growth and other long-term objectives”. \nRockwell’s shares fell 1.3 percent in morning trading. \nThe company reported a loss of $1.84 per share in the first quarter ended Dec. 31, compared with a profit of $1.65 per share a year earlier. The loss was due to charges related to the new U.S. tax code, the company said. \nExcluding items, Rockwell earned $1.96 per share, above the average analyst estimate of $1.74 per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. \nRevenue rose 6.5 percent to $1.59 billion. \nRockwell raised its fiscal 2018 adjusted profit forecast to $7.60-$7.90 per share from $7.20-$7.50.
