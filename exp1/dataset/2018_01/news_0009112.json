So it’s not the executive that will be getting involved,” Nyssen told Reuters in an interview during a visit to London.\nMacron strongly criticized Russian state-backed media outlets Russia Today and Sputnik during a visit to France by Russian President Vladimir Putin last year, denouncing them as “agents of influence and propaganda” who spread lies about him.\nWithout naming any particular media, Nyssen said that under the proposed new rules the CSA would be empowered to quickly remove broadcasting rights from any outlet that was deemed to be largely untrue and aimed at destabilizing French democracy.\n“We are talking about media backed by foreign money who broadcast in a nefarious way information to destabilize, information that is false,” said Nyssen.\n“We have to think about how to extend the CSA’s powers so that it could step in, not at the moment of the granting of broadcasting rights but further down the line, based on the reality of what is happening with such outlets.”\nShe was at pains to say that the new powers to crack down on fake news were only part of the strategy, and that it was also crucial to work on educating everyone in society to better judge what constituted reliable news and what did not. She said lots of work was under way to further that agenda.\nNyssen was in London to meet with BBC executives to discuss the British public broadcaster’s own thinking on the issue of how to tackle fake news.\nReporting by Estelle Shirbon Editing by Jeremy Gaunt\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-09T15:59:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-09T16:11:20.002+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
