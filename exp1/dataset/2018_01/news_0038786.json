He was so excited about it,” said Townsend, who gave Guardiola a signed Scotland jersey. \nScotland’s form under Townsend sees them come into the Six Nations as outside contenders, capable of upsetting any team with their frenetic attacking play. \nBarclay said the plaudits coming Scotland’s way have been flattering but warned of the threats posed by the other teams in a tough Six Nations schedule. \n“I have said a number of times today that Ireland and England didn’t lose in the autumn. England have lost once in two years. Plus, Wales have done well in the Six Nations, French clubs have done well in the Champions Cup,” said Barclay. \n“So that is the challenge and I am not naive enough to think we are going to win just because we are going well.” \nTownsend said he couldn’t remember a time when northern hemisphere rugby was so strong, off the back of impressive autumn results. \nScotland haven’t won the Six Nations since the expansion in 2000. However, Townsend was a player when Scotland won the final Five Nations tournament in 1999. \nWinning as coach though would be more special. \n“Six is better than five,” joked Townsend. \n“It is a better feeling than when you are a player, seeing the boys go out and defeat Australia. Winning the Six Nations would be huge for all of Scottish rugby.” (Reporting by Jack Tarrant; Editing by Jon Boyle)", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-24T15:56:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-24T16:23:07.039+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
