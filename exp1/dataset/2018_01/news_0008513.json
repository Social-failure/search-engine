Exports rose 16.7 percent in December from the same month a year earlier, while production was up 1.5 percent. \n“Despite the uncertainty surrounding NAFTA and rumors Mexico wouldn’t be able to continue exporting to the United States, it’s important to note that not only did we hit a record in exports but we also had record export numbers to the United States with nearly 10 percent growth,” said AMIA President Eduardo Solis. \nAMIA has a preliminary production forecast of over 4 million units for 2018, said Solis, a 6 percent increase in output over last year. \nFull-year production came to 3.77 million units in 2017, while exports totaled 3.10 million units, according to AMIA. \nWith Canada and Mexico objecting to major changes that Washington wants in NAFTA, time is running out to settle differences before the negotiations are scheduled to wrap up at the end of March. \nMexico’s booming auto sector has benefited from NAFTA as major manufacturers, such as General Motors Co, Ford Motor Co, Fiat Chrysler Automobiles and Volkswagen AG, have made the country a top export hub, attracted by cheap labor and free trade pacts with more than 40 nations. \nHowever, car sales in Mexico contracted 4.6 percent in 2017 from a year earlier and fell 17.6 percent in December, as stubbornly high inflation squeezed domestic consumption. \nInflation likely ticked up in December to its highest rate in 16-1/2 years due to rising energy and food prices, a Reuters survey of analysts showed on Monday.
