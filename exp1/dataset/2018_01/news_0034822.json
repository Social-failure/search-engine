McEachran won with 96.40 while Goepper was third with 93.20. \n“The last Olympics went by in a flash, a whirlwind,” said Kenworthy. \n“This time I want to soak up the experience, really be there for it and make memories that will last a lifetime.” \nThe U.S. women’s team, however, was still to be decided after Sunday’s competitions with Maggie Voisin the only athlete to have previously qualified. \nCaroline Claire made a strong case to be added to the team after her third place finish on Sunday, which marked the 17-year-old’s first Olympic qualifying podium after she scored an 85.00 on the first of her two runs. \nShe finished behind Norway’s Tiril Sjaastad Christiansen of Norway and Sweden’s Jennie-Lee Burmansson. \nTaylor Lundquist also made her case to be named to the U.S. team with a fifth place finish in the World Cup event.
