Shore was then brought in for questioning and confessed to murdering and raping five girls and women in the Houston area, the office said. \nHe was convicted in 2004 and sentenced to death. \nHis victims included Maria del Carmen Estrada, 21, whose nude body was found in a Dairy Queen drive-through in 1992, the district attorney’s office for the county containing Houston said. \nOther victims included 14-year-old Laurie Tremblay who was killed in 1986; a 14-year-old girl whose name was not released who he killed in 1993; Dana Rebollar, 9, who was killed in 1994, and 16-year-old Dana Sanchez, killed in 1995. \nShore had been scheduled to be put to death in October but the execution was postponed at the request of prosecutors. At the time, they were investigating whether Shore had plotted with fellow inmate Larry Swearingen to take the rap for the murder that put Swearingen on death row. \nAs of late Wednesday, there were no last-minute appeals filed. Courts have rejected previous appeals to spare Shore’s life.
