I’ve lost Matty Phillips in the warmup, and that was a major blow to us because that meant we had to change our system. So we had a lot of things go wrong for us tonight and most of it is down to the turnaround that we had,” he said. \nWest Bromwich Albion will have until Saturday to recuperate before an FA Cup third-round trip to Exeter. \nWest Ham must gear themselves up for a trip on Thursday night to in-form London neighbours Tottenham Hotspur.
