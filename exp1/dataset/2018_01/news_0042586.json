This contributed to a $1.87 billion loss in 2016, its first loss since 2010. \nEtihad confirmed to Reuters it has grounded its Airbus freighter fleet, five A330 Freighters, and that it had opted to operate an all-Boeing 777 Freighter fleet. It declined to comment on whether it had offered pilots unpaid leave. \n“This freighter is the right aircraft for our long-term requirements,” Peter Baumgartner, the chief executive of Etihad’s airline operations, said in an email to Reuters. \nEtihad operates five Boeing 777 Freighters. \nThe Abu Dhabi-based airline is considering selling or leasing the Airbus freighters, one of the sources said. \nEtihad’s cargo operation slowed in 2016 to report flat growth of 596,000 tonnes handled. \nEtihad is encouraging pilots to take unpaid leave for periods as short as one week or as long as 18 months as it reviews its fleet requirements with the intention of retiring some aircraft, according to three sources. \nPilots are being asked to take leave on a voluntary basis, one of the sources said. \nEtihad employed 2,225 pilots for a fleet of 122 jets as of February 2017, according to the most recent data on its website. \nEtihad has made few comments on its strategy review in which hundreds of positions have been removed and several routes cut since it was launched. \nEtihad once owned as many as eight minority stakes in other airlines; two have been sold and another two have declared insolvency. \nNew Group Chief Executive Tony Douglas, who joined this month, is likely to have to decide what to do with those investments.
