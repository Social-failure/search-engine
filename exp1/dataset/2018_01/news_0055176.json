They did not immediately respond on Tuesday to requests for comment. A lawyer for the defendants could not immediately be identified. \nThe U.S. Food and Drug Administration discourages children from using e-cigarettes, many of which contain nicotine, and has said it hopes this year to launch a full-scale education campaign to warn teenagers about the dangers. \nWrigley said Get Wrecked has ignored its demands to stop sales of infringing products, though it changed the “Skeetlez” product image to a rainbow. \nThe case is Wm Wrigley Jr Co v Get Wrecked Juices LLC et al, U.S. District Court, Northern District of Illinois, No. 18-00642.
