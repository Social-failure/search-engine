And bits of plastic may act as rafts for harmful microbes in the oceans.\nScientists were shocked to find plastic even in remote reefs.\n“You could be diving and you think someone’s tapping your shoulder but it’s just a bottle knocking against you, or a plastic trash bag stuck on your tank,” lead author Joleah Lamb of Cornell University told Reuters.\n“It’s really sad,” she said.\nFILE PHOTO: A scuba diver swims above a bed of corals off Malaysia's Tioman island in the South China Sea May 4, 2008. REUTERS/David Loh/File Photo “Corals are animals like us and have really thin tissues that can be cut and wounded, especially if they are cut by an item covered in all sorts of micro-organisms,” she said.\nThe scientists, from the United States, Australia, Thailand, Myanmar, Canada and Indonesia, surveyed 159 reefs from 2011-14 in the Asia-Pacific region.\nThey found most plastic in Indonesia, with about 26 bits per 100 square meters (1076 square feet) of reef, and least off Australia, which has the strictest waste controls.\nSlideshow (4 Images) The link between disease and plastic may well apply to other reefs such as in the Caribbean and off Africa, and may be harming other life on the ocean floor such as sponges or kelp, Lamb said.\nAt least 275 million people worldwide live near reefs, which provide food, coastal protection and income from tourism. The presence of plastics seemed especially to aggravate some common coral afflictions, such as skeletal eroding band disease.\nThe scientists urged tougher restrictions on plastic waste. In December, almost 200 nations agreed to limit plastic pollution of the oceans, warning that it could outweigh all fish by 2030.\nCo-author Douglas Rader of the U.S. Environmental Defense Fund said better management of fisheries was the best way to strengthen coral reefs to enable them to fend off man-made threats such as more plastics.\n“This is not a story about ‘let’s give up on corals’,” he told Reuters. “Overfishing today is the biggest threat.” He said nations from Belize to the Philippines were acting to regulate fisheries on corals.\nStudy at: here\nReporting By Alister Doyle; Editing by Raissa Kasolowsky\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-25T21:07:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-25T21:26:16.022+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
