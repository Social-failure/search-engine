Using the northbound M503 and related routes will effectively ease the currently existing air route’s traffic pressure,” it said.\nChina considers Taiwan a wayward province, and broke off official communication with the Taiwan government after Tsai’s independence-leaning Democratic Progressive Party won power in 2016.\nChina suspects Tsai wants to push for formal independence though, she has said she wants to maintain the status quo with China and is committed to ensuring peace.\nReporting by Jess Macy Yu; Additional reporting by Brenda Goh and Michael Martina; Editing by Michael Perry\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-08T09:25:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-08T09:45:34.010+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
