For the quarter ended December 31, 2017, the Company reported a net loss of $1.4 million or $0.58 per diluted share, compared to net income of $420,000 or $0.17 per diluted share for the quarter ended December 31, 2016. For the six months ended December 31, 2017, the Company reported a net loss of $359,000 or $0.15 per diluted share, compared to net income of $993,000 or $0.41 per diluted share for the same period last year. The loss for the quarter was the result of a one-time revaluation adjustment to the Company's deferred tax asset to account for the future impact of lower corporate tax rates as a result of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act that was enacted on December 22, 2017. The tax revaluation resulted in a $2.4 million increase in the Company's income tax expense and a ($0.96) reduction in earnings per diluted share for the second quarter.\n\"While the reduction in corporate tax rates required a one-time adjustment to our net deferred tax asset, I am nonetheless pleased with our core operating results,\" stated Jerald L. Shaw, President and Chief Executive Officer. \"Income before the provision for income taxes for the second quarter was $1.4 million which is our highest level of earnings since the financial crisis. Our net interest margin increased 11 basis points to 4.27% and our efficiency ratio improved 145 basis points to 72.1% as compared to 86.6% for the same quarter last year.\" stated Mr. Shaw.\nFiscal Second Quarter Highlights\nLoans receivable, net, increased $20.3 million, or 5.4%, to $398.2 million at December 31, 2017 from $377.9 million at June 30, 2017;\nNet interest income before provision for loan losses increased $431,000, or 10.5%, to $4.5 million for the quarter ended December 31, 2017 compared to $4.1 million for the quarter ended December 31, 2016;\nNet interest margin (\"NIM\") was 4.27% for the quarter ended December 31, 2017 compared to 4.16% for the quarter ended December 31, 2016; and\nAllowance for losses as a percent of nonperforming loans increased to 283.3% from 110.8% at June 30, 2017.\nBalance Sheet Review\nTotal assets increased by $10.3 million, or 2.2%, to $472.8 million at December 31, 2017 from $462.5 million at June 30, 2017. Cash and cash equivalents decreased by $6.8 million, or 47.7%, to $7.4 million at December 31, 2017, from $14.2 million at June 30, 2017. Securities available-for-sale and held-to-maturity decreased $1.3 million, or 6.3%, and $749,000 or 15.1%, respectively. The decreases in these portfolios were primarily the result of contractual principal repayments.\nLoans receivable, net, increased $20.3 million, or 5.4%, to $398.2 million at December 31, 2017 from $377.9 million at June 30, 2017 due to increases in construction and one-to-four family loans. Construction loans increased $27.9 million, or 56.9%, to $77.1 million at December 31, 2017 from $49.2 million at June 30, 2017. There was $43.0 million in undisbursed construction loan commitments at December 31, 2017. Our construction loans are primarily for the construction of multi-family properties and to a lesser extent, loans for the construction of single family and commercial properties. One-to-four family loans increased $5.2 million, or 8.6%, to $64.9 million at December 31, 2017 from $59.7 million at June 30, 2017. All other loan categories decreased. Commercial real estate loans decreased $9.8 million, or 6.3%, to $145.7 million at December 31, 2017 from $155.5 million at June 30, 2017. This decrease was primarily due to the repayments of a $3.2 million commercial real estate loan secured by a self-storage facility, a $3.2 million loan for two industrial properties and a $1.0 million loan secured by a professional office property. We also reclassified a $2.0 million multi-tenant commercial real estate loan to real estate owned (\"REO\") and recorded during the six months ended December 31, 2017 a $200,000 charge upon transfer to reflect its fair market value. Land loans decreased $1.5 million, or 18.3%, to $6.6 million at December 31, 2017 from $8.1 million at June 30, 2017. Multi-family loans decreased $579,000, or 1.0%, to $59.9 million at December 31, 2017 from $60.5 million at June 30, 2017. Consumer loans decreased $384,000, or 2.0%, to $18.4 million at December 31, 2017 from $18.7 million at June 30, 2017. Commercial business loans decreased $698,000, or 2.2%, to $30.9 million at December 31, 2017 from $31.6 million at June 30, 2017.\nLoans receivable consisted of the following at the dates indicated:\nDecember 31,\n2017 June 30, 2017 December 31,\n2016 (In thousands) Real estate: One-to-four family $ 64,893 $ 59,735 $ 60,191 Multi-family 59,921 60,500 52,099 Commercial 145,749 155,525 139,529 Construction 77,136 49,151 44,057 Land loans 6,581 8,054 7,367 Total real estate 354,280 332,965 303,243 Consumer: Home equity 14,013 13,991 15,949 Credit cards 2,405 2,596 2,731 Automobile 497 627 650 Other consumer 1,439 1,524 1,791 Total consumer 18,354 18,738 21,121 Business: Commercial business 30,905 31,603 34,850 Total Loans 403,539 383,306 359,214 Less: Deferred loan fees and loan premiums, net 1,186 1,292 1,226 Allowance for loan losses 4,128 4,106 3,861 Loans receivable, net $ 398,225 $ 377,908 $ 354,127 Total liabilities increased $10.9 million to $407.6 million at December 31, 2017 from $396.7 million at June 30, 2017, primarily as the result of an increase of $17.5 million in FHLB advances, partially offset by a decrease of $6.7 million in deposits. The increase in FHLB advances was primarily used as a funding source for our loan portfolio growth.\nDeposits consisted of the following at the dates indicated:\nDecember 31, 2017 June 30, 2017 December 31, 2016 Amount Percent Amount Percent Amount Percent (Dollars in thousands) Noninterest-bearing demand deposits $ 50,285 14.9 % $ 52,606 15.2 % $ 50,546 15.4 % Interest-bearing demand deposits 32,875 9.7 31,464 9.1 29,505 9.0 Money market accounts 62,036 18.3 73,154 21.2 89,969 27.5 Savings deposits 45,134 13.3 43,454 12.6 43,890 13.4 Certificates of deposit 148,122 43.8 144,509 41.9 113,686 34.7 Total deposits $ 338,452 100.0 % $ 345,187 100.0 % $ 327,596 100.0 % Credit Quality\nTotal delinquent loans (past due 30 days or more), decreased $1.9 million to $2.2 million at December 31, 2017 from $4.1 million at June 30, 2017, primarily due to the transfer of the $2.0 million commercial real estate loan discussed above to REO at a fair market value of $1.8 million. The percentage of nonperforming loans, consisting solely of nonaccrual loans, to total loans decreased to 0.4% at December 31, 2017 from 1.0% at June 30, 2017. The Company recorded a $105,000 provision for loan losses for the quarter ended December 31, 2017 due to loan growth. The allowance for loan losses of $4.1 million at December 31, 2017 represented 1.0% of total loans and 283.3% of nonperforming loans. This compares to an allowance of $4.1 million at June 30, 2017, representing 1.1% of total loans and 110.8% of nonperforming loans.\nNonperforming loans decreased to $1.5 million at December 31, 2017, from $3.7 million at June 30, 2017, and were $2.8 million at December 31, 2016. Nonperforming loans consisted of the following at the dates indicated:\nDecember 31,\n2017 June 30, 2017 December 31,\n2016 (In thousands) Real estate: One-to-four family $ 949 $ 1,170 $ 2,421 Commercial — 1,992 201 Total real estate 949 3,162 2,622 Consumer: Home equity 223 242 68 Total consumer 223 242 68 Business: Commercial business 285 300 85 Total $ 1,457 $ 3,704 $ 2,775 As of December 31, 2017, the Company had three REO properties with an aggregate book value of $3.3 million compared to three properties with an aggregate book value of $867,000 at June 30, 2017, and two properties with an aggregate book value of $103,000 at December 31, 2016. The increase in the aggregate book value of REO properties was primarily attributable to the reclassification of the commercial real estate loan discussed above and capital improvements incurred subsequent to its transfer to REO. The increase was partially offset by a sale of a one-to-four family property for $115,000 resulting in a loss on sale of $15,000.\nCapital\nAs of December 31, 2017, the Bank was considered \"well capitalized\" in accordance with its regulatory capital guidelines and exceeded all regulatory capital requirements with Tier 1 Leverage-Based Capital, Common Equity Tier 1 Capital (\"CET1\"), Tier 1 Risk-Based Capital, and Total Risk-Based Capital ratios of 13.0%, 14.1%, 14.1%, and 15.1% respectively. As of December 31, 2016, the Bank's Tier 1 Leverage-Based Capital, CET1, Tier 1 Risk-Based Capital, and Total Risk-Based Capital ratios were 13.3%, 14.2%, 14.2%, and 15.2%, respectively.\nAnchor Bancorp exceeded all regulatory capital requirements with Tier 1 Leverage-Based Capital, CET1, Tier 1 Risk-Based Capital, and Total Risk-Based Capital ratios of 14.0%, 15.2%, 15.2%, and 16.1% as of December 31, 2017. As of December 31, 2016, the Company's Tier 1 Leverage-Based Capital, CET1, Tier 1 Risk-Based Capital, and Total Risk-Based Capital ratios were 14.3%, 15.2%, 15.2%, and 16.2%, respectively.\nOperating Results\nNet interest income . Net interest income before the provision for loan losses increased $431,000, or 10.5%, to $4.5 million for the quarter ended December 31, 2017 compared to $4.1 million for the same period last year primarily due to the increase in average loans receivable, net. Average loans receivable, net, for the quarter ended December 31, 2017 increased $37.4 million, or 10.4%, to $396.4 million compared to $359.0 million for the quarter ended December 31, 2016.\nThe Company's net interest margin was 4.27% for the quarter ended December 31, 2017 compared to 4.16% for the quarter ended December 31, 2016. The average yield on loans receivable, net, increased 14 basis points to 5.42% for the quarter ended December 31, 2017 compared to 5.28% for the same period of the prior year, reflecting the increase in high yield construction loans. The average yield on mortgage-backed securities increased to 2.14% from 1.98% for the same period in the prior year primarily due to a decrease of large principal pay downs resulting in an increase in amortization of premiums. The average yield on interest-earning assets increased 22 basis points to 5.18% from 4.96% for the quarters ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The average cost of total deposits increased 13 basis points to 1.12% for the quarter ended December 31, 2017 compared to 0.99% for the same period in the prior year. The average cost of interest-bearing liabilities increased 14 basis points to 1.14% for the quarter ended December 31, 2017 compared to 1.00% for the same period in the prior year, reflecting the increases in both FHLB advances and in the federal funds rate over the last year. Net interest income before the provision for loan losses increased $704,000, or 8.6%, to $8.9 million for the six months ended December 31, 2017 compared to $8.2 million for the same period last year primarily due to the increase in average loans receivable, net over the last year. The average yield on interest-earning assets increased 17 basis point to 5.12% for the six months ended December 31, 2017 compared to 4.95% for the same period in the prior year primarily due to the increase in the average yield on loans receivable, net. The average cost of interest-bearing liabilities increased 14 basis points to 1.14% for the six months ended December 31, 2017 compared to 1.00% for the same period of the prior year, for the reasons stated above.\nProvision for loan losses . In connection with its analysis of the loan portfolio, management determined that a $105,000 provision for loan losses was required for the quarter ended December 31, 2017 compared to $75,000 for the same period last year, primarily reflecting our recent loan growth. Provision for loan losses for the six months ended December 31, 2017 was $180,000 compared to $150,000 for the same period last year.\nNoninterest income . Noninterest income remained relatively the same at $1.0 million for both the quarters ended December 31, 2017 and 2016. A decrease of $71,000 in deposit service fees from $348,000 to $277,000 as consumers reduced their deposit account overdrafts was partially offset by an increase for gain on sales of loans of $48,000 due to an increase in loans sold. Noninterest income increased $21,000, or 1.0%, to $2.1 million during the six months ended December 31, 2017 which was relatively unchanged from the same period in 2016.\nNoninterest expense . Noninterest expense decreased $427,000, or 9.7%, to $4.0 million for the quarter ended December 31, 2017 from $4.4 million for the quarter ended December 31, 2016. General and administrative expenses declined $261,000 to $572,000 for the quarter ended December 31, 2017 compared to $833,000 for the quarter ended December 31, 2016. This decrease was mainly due to no unfunded loan reserve commitment expense during the current quarter compared to a $75,000 unfunded loan reserve commitment expense in the quarter ended December 31, 2016, and a $46,000 reduction in legal fees and a $31,000 decrease in contribution expense between the periods. Marketing decreased $83,000 to $84,000 for the quarter ended December 31, 2017 from $167,000 for the same quarter last year. Compensation and benefits expense decreased $76,000 or 3.3%, to $2.2 million for the quarter ended December 31, 2017 from $2.3 million for the same period in the previous year. The decrease was primarily due to a reduction in stock-based compensation expense related to the Anchor Bancorp 2015 Equity Plan to $19,000 for the quarter ended December 31, 2017 from $147,000 for the same quarter last year and incentive loan commission decreasing $105,000 from $180,000 for the same quarter last year. These decreases were partially offset by $245,000 for retention bonuses paid this quarter associated with the pending merger with Washington Federal, Inc. Noninterest expense decreased $822,000, or 9.4%, to $7.9 million during the six months ended December 31, 2017 compared to $8.7 million for the same period in 2016 primarily due to a $301,000 decrease in compensation and benefits expense and a $424,000 decline in general and administrative expenses.\nAbout the Company\nAnchor Bancorp is headquartered in Lacey, Washington and is the parent company of Anchor Bank, a community-based savings bank primarily serving Western Washington through its 10 full-service banking offices (including one Wal-Mart in-store location) within Grays Harbor, Thurston, Lewis, Pierce and Mason counties, and one loan production office located in King County, Washington.

See also Non-GAAP Financial Measures reconciliation in the table below. Non-GAAP Financial Measures:\nIn addition to results presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles utilized in the United States (\"GAAP”), this earnings release contains the tangible book value per share, a non-GAAP financial measure. We calculate tangible common equity by excluding intangible assets from stockholders’ equity. We calculate tangible book value per share by dividing tangible common equity by the number of common shares outstanding. We calculate tangible common equity by excluding intangible assets from stockholders' equity. The Company believes that this measure is consistent with the capital treatment by our bank regulatory agencies, which excludes intangible assets from the calculation of risk-based capital ratios and presents this measure to facilitate comparison of the quality and composition of the Company's capital over time and in comparison to its competitors. This non-GAAP financial measure has inherent limitations, is not required to be uniformly applied and is not audited. Further, the non-GAAP financial measure should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for book value per share or total stockholders' equity determined in accordance with GAAP and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. Reconciliations of the GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures are presented below.\nDecember 31,\n2017 September 30,\n2017 June 30,\n2017 December 30,\n2016 (In thousands) Stockholders' equity $ 65,197 $ 66,776 $ 65,851 $ 64,082 Less: intangible assets 260 246 232 213 Tangible common stockholders' equity $ 64,937 $ 66,530 $ 65,619 $ 63,869 Total assets $ 472,792 $ 460,387 $ 462,525 $ 440,911 Less: intangible assets 260 246 232 213 Tangible assets $ 472,532 $ 460,141 $ 462,293 $ 440,698 Tangible common stockholders' equity $ 64,937 $ 66,530 $ 65,619 $ 63,869 Common shares outstanding at end of period 2,489,030 2,494,940 2,504,740 2,504,740 Common stockholders' equity (book value) per share (GAAP) $ 26.19 $ 26.76 $ 26.29 $ 25.58 Tangible common stockholders' equity (tangible book value) per share (non-GAAP) $ 26.09 $ 26.67 $ 26.20 $ 25.50 Contact:\nJerald L.
