Of the 68 companies in the benchmark index that have posted results, 76.5 percent have topped Wall Street expectations.\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 17.21 points, or 0.07 percent, to 26,197.39, the S&P 500 gained 4.38 points, or 0.15 percent, to 2,837.35 and the Nasdaq Composite added 41.32 points, or 0.56 percent, to 7,449.36.\nJohnson & Johnson fell 3.91 percent, dragged down by a $13.6-billion charge related to the new U.S. tax law and a court ruling on a crucial patent on its blockbuster rheumatoid arthritis drug Remicade.\nProcter & Gamble dropped 3.25 percent as investors focused on a drop in gross margins at the world’s largest consumer goods maker.\nU.S. President Donald Trump on Monday approved steep import tariffs on washing machines and solar panels, a move that was criticized by China, South Korea and Europe and stoked fears about potential retaliation.\nIn the wake of the tariffs, shares of Whirlpool rose 3.43 percent and smaller solar names such as Real Goods Solar, up 28.70 percent and Sunworks, up 7.26 percent, moved higher.\nVerizon edged higher, up 0.07 percent as its quarterly profit fell short of Wall Street estimates but revenue beat expectations as it added phone subscribers.\nAdvancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 1.45-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.17-to-1 ratio favored advancers.\nThe S&P 500 posted 132 new 52-week highs and 1 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 208 new highs and 14 new lows.
