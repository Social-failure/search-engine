While activists often see the business community as the enemy, there is actually “tremendous goodwill”. \n“If you do nothing to nurture that goodwill, it’s a waste,” said Friedman. \nThe Mekong Club created the business pledge against modern slavery in order to capitalize on corporate support. \nSo far, six companies have signed the pledge, which requires them to take concrete steps, which include monitoring operations and creating policies to prevent slavery. \nOne signatory, VF Co., began in 2016 to audit 120 factories that supply materials for its brands, which include The North Face, Wrangler and Vans. \nMost of the factories are in China, Korea, Taiwan and India, said Craig Hodges, a spokesman. He said the audits have so far turned up “nothing extreme”, but they have uncovered some problems including poor accommodation for migrant workers. \n“The factories are given six months to address the issues and we re-audit to ensure they have been corrected,” he said. “If they have not corrected the issue, we then reject the facility and it is prohibited from working with VF.” \nWhile the spotlight has long been on the apparel industry, it affects other not so obvious sectors too, such as banking. \nThe Commonwealth Bank of Australia became the latest company to commit to the business pledge, signing this month, said Friedman. \nForced labor, mostly in Asia and the Pacific, generates $150 billion per year, according to the United Nations’ ILO. \nFriedman said the Mekong Club’s finance working group “is looking to find the nexus of this money in relationship to banks.” \nThe hotel and casino industry is also particularly vulnerable to forced labor, said Bowie of MGM. \nHotel rooms can be used for exploitation, for example, while staff, “particularly those recruited or subcontracted via unscrupulous agencies”, may be victims of bonded labor. \nIn addition to doing the right thing, he said, there is a business case for rooting out slavery. \n“Businesses are at risk of severe reputational damage and loss of market share and consumer confidence if they are found to have slavery in their supply chains,” said Bowie.
