The company is also backed by Y Combinator and Founders Fund, the venture firm led by early Facebook backer Peter Thiel .\nWhile Gore doesn't focus specifically on tech, he's had plenty of exposure to Silicon Valley. He's a board member at Apple and has long had ties to venture firm Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers , which still lists him as a senior partner.\nMoskovitz and fellow Asana co-founder Justin Rosenstein said in Tuesday's statement that, \"we have both greatly admired Al Gore and the Generation team for their sustainability leadership in the business and financial community.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-31T03:46:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-31T03:46:15.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
