To get it delivered daily to your in-box, sign up here . \nGood morning one last time from Davos, where the U.S. president just finished reading a speech wholly from the teleprompter, declared America open for business, and asserted that “America first does not mean America alone.” It was a self-congratulatory speech that, but for one gentle jab at those in the room who supported Hillary Clinton, completely avoided provoking his well-heeled audience. (Trump did take a shot at the news media, as did World Economic Founder Klaus Schwab, but that won’t make headlines.) \nThursday night, as Donald Trump dined with a group of 15 business executives—I’m told by someone who was there the president was relaxed among fellow businesspeople and in listening mode— Fortune also hosted a dinner. We gathered an only-slightly-larger group to discuss one of the more pressing topics among corporate and government types this year in Davos, the future of work. \nThis wasn’t so much a conversation about whether robots powered by artificial intelligence will eliminate everyone’s jobs as an acknowledgement that technology will obliterate work as we know it and how to encourage the necessary “re-skilling” in response. \nAs happens in Davos, our’s was a high-powered gathering. At my table alone were Jim Kim, president of the World Bank, and CEOs Ginni Rometty of IBM , Marc Benioff of Salesforce, Paul Polman of Unilever, Andrew Liveris of Dow, and Feike Sijbesma of DSM. (The conglomerate’s name once was Dutch State Mines, but Sijbesma likes to say it stands for “Doing Something Meaningful.) \nTraining people for the new economy is complicated and overwhelming. Our dinner conversation ranged from focusing on feeding children in developing countries as a precursor to educating them to teaching specifically employable skills (as opposed to, say, poetry) to the need for corporations who demand specific skills to do more with their time and money to ensure a supply of workers who have them. \nIt’s a daunting problem. At the same time, I was struck by the optimism of the group—though it occurred to me more than once this week that attendees at the forum are overwhelmingly optimists. (Nature or nurture? I think I know the answer.) \nThey also are realists, of course, perhaps no one more than Jim Kim, a former university president and groundbreaking physician. He speaks regularly, here for example , about the concept of “reference income,” the notion that as incomes rise in developing countries so does awareness of how much more money people in the developed world make. That leads directly to dissatisfaction, yet another challenge to worry about for those mindful of the global economy and its workforce. Adam Lashinsky @adamlashinsky NEWSWORTHY \nDigital discount . Readers of electronic books may be getting the first good news in the eight years since the major publishers and Apple conspired to raise prices. Walmart says it’s is going to make a major push in ebooks via the Kobo platform, which had partnered with Borders before that chain went bankrupt. The giant retailer didn’t discuss its ebook pricing strategy but is known for discounting. Meanwhile, Apple is simplifying the interfaces on its ebook app and store. \nDigital discount, part II . One of Japan’s largest digital currency exchanges, Coincheck , has stopped letting customers make withdrawals and halted bitcoin trading, prompting a 7% drop in bitcoin’s price. Back in the United States, free stock trading app Robinhood said it will start allowing free digital currency trading, as well. \nTeenage angst . The latest attack on social networks came from billionaire investor George Soros . “They deliberately engineer addiction to the services they provide,” Soros said at Davos. “This can be very harmful, particularly for adolescents.” \nGrown up angst. The panels that advise the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists on its Doomsday clock have pushed the measure of the risk of nuclear war to just two minutes before midnight. That’s the closest the clock has been to doomsday since 1953. “Hyperbolic rhetoric and provocative actions” by North Korea and President Donald Trump prompted the move, the magazine said. \nThe fix is in . San Jose Mayor Sam Liccardo resigned from a Federal Communications Commission advisory panel on broadband , saying the group was stacked with telecom industry insiders. “It’s obvious that this body is going to deliver to the industry what the industry wants,” Liccardo told Axios . \nGood for the gander. After all the troubles at Uber, it’s time for some scandal at competitor Lyft , it appears. Employees are alleged to have peeked into the ride histories of celebs like Mark Zuckerberg. Lyft said it is investigating the matter. \nNo holes in this report . Intel announced fourth quarter results that beat Wall Street expectations, thanks largely to booming sales of chips for servers and data centers. The company also said it would incorporate fixes for the Spectre and Meltdown security attacks into new chips this year. Shares of Intel jumped 7% in premarket trading on Friday, regaining all of the ground they lost since the attacks were disclosed. One of Intel’s biggest customers, Dell , may want to go public again, almost five years after going private, Bloomberg reports .
