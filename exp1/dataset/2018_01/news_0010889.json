His most recent injury, a torn ACL and meniscus suffered last May, meant Christensen did not ski this season until the end of November.

REUTERS/Dylan Martinez/File Photo \nCombine that with a brief loss of sponsorship and a dog bite in Bosnia that required 40 rabies and tetanus shots and it all adds up to less than ideal preparations for defending his Olympic crown. \nHowever, in a Sports Illustrated interview last month, Christensen was upbeat about competing in Pyeongchang and being fully fit by February, despite admitting the battle with injury had been a difficult journey. \n“My knee decided to win the battle against this injury,” said Christensen. \n“At that point, once everything started getting better and better, I just got all the negative thoughts out of my brain and I felt like that just helped me get through all the down time I’ve had and rehab that much better.” \nChristensen sat out the first two qualifying events in December as he continues to heal his knee, yet hopes to qualify through competing at the final two events held in January at Aspen and Mammoth.
