( bit.ly/2nCz1zI ) \nMellanox had also forecast 2018 operating margins would be better than in 2017, but lower than in 2016. \nThe targets are “not nearly enough” to offset years of poor performance and missed expectations, Starboard, Mellanox’s biggest shareholder, said in a letter to the company. \nMellanox lacks sufficient credibility to convince shareholders that it will hit even these modest targets, said Starboard, which bought a 10.7 percent stake in the company in November to influence strategy. \nThe hedge fund said it remains concerned that the targets were “merely reactionary” and, even if achieved, does not come close to addressing the magnitude of the problem at the company.
