A group of state attorneys general immediately vowed to sue.\nA trade group representing major tech companies including Facebook Inc, Alphabet Inc and Amazon.com Inc said last week it will back legal challenges to the reversal.\nThe vote in December marked a victory for AT&T Inc, Comcast Corp and Verizon Communications Inc and hands them power over what content consumers can access over the internet. It marked the biggest win for FCC Chairman Ajit Pai in his sweeping effort to undo many telecommunications regulations.\nSenate Democrats on Tuesday called the FCC decision “un-American” and an “all-out assault on consumers”\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, a Republican, backs the FCC repeal. A reversal of the FCC vote would need the approval of the Senate, U.S. House and President Donald Trump. Trump also backed the FCC action, the White House said last month.\nThe FCC order grants internet providers sweeping new powers to block, throttle or discriminate among internet content, but requires public disclosure of those practices. Internet providers have vowed not to change how consumers get online content.\nDemocrats say net neutrality is essential to protect consumers, while Republicans say the rules hindered investment by providers and were not needed.\nDemocratic Senator Ed Markey said on Tuesday he had 39 co-sponsors to force a vote, but it is not clear when the vote will occur since the new rules will not take effect for at least another three months. “There will be a political price to pay for those who are on the wrong side of history,” Markey said.\nRepublicans control the Senate with 51 votes out of the 100-member body.\nSenator Brian Schatz, a Hawaii Democrat, said the issue was resonating with teenagers and college students. “People are mobilizing across the country to save the free and open internet,” Schatz said.\nReporting by David Shepardson; Editing by Bill Rigby\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-09T20:52:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-09T21:12:20.019+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
