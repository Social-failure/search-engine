Winner of the toughest @dakar ever done in South America at 55 years of age (good number) and he did it in his own way,” said the driver, who races with the number 55. \nSainz finished ninth on the last stage, beating al-Attiyah by 43 minutes.

Especially this rally, it has been so, so hard,” added the Spaniard, who left open the question of whether he would be back next year without Peugeot. \n“At the beginning I said we’ll take it a little bit easier, but Peugeot said we’d have to go flat out. I raced a couple of days and pushed really hard, but then the race was a case of not making mistakes.” \nRussian Eduard Nikolaev won the truck category in a Kamaz for the second year in a row and third time in total. Chilean Ignacio Casale won the quadbike title for the second time.
