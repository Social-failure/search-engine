He clocked up a total of 222 appearances for the Basque club, scoring 10 goals. \nOn the international stage, Laporte has featured 19 times for France at Under-21 level. \nLaporte becomes City’s sixth signing of the season following the arrival of Ederson, Danilo, Kyle Walker, Benjamin Mendy and Bernardo Silva at the start of the campaign. \nSpeaking at a news conference ahead of Wednesday’s league clash against West Bromwich Albion, Guardiola said Laporte has all the attributes required to adapt to the demands of the English game. \n“We are very aware of his skills. He’s an experienced central defender on the big stages and has the skills to help us,” Guardiola said. \n”He will be able to start right away. The Premier League is special in many senses. But he is intelligent. \n“It’s always tough for a new player but we will be patient with him. He is the perfect age to be with us for a while.” Reporting by Hardik Vyas in Bengaluru, editing by Ed Osmond and Christian Radnedge", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-30T16:24:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-30T17:13:56.010+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
