REUTERS/Jonathan Ernst/File Photo \nThe U.S. Justice Department on Thursday rescinded an Obama-era policy that had eased enforcement of federal marijuana laws in states that have legalized the drug, instead giving federal prosecutors wide latitude on pursuing criminal charges. \n“In light of yesterday’s announcement there are certainly some disclosure issues that companies should address,” Canadian Securities Exchange Chief Executive Richard Carleton told Reuters via telephone. \nThe exchange has contacted 17 cannabis companies with U.S. exposure whose shares it lists, asking for public statements on how the policy announced by U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions could impact their businesses, Carleton said. \nThose companies include CannaRoyalty Corp ( CRZ.CD ) and Liberty Health Sciences Inc ( LHS.CD ), he said. \nThe move follows an October notice from Canadian securities regulators that U.S.-linked marijuana companies must clearly warn investors about the risks, given the federal ban on marijuana production and sales. \nDozens of marijuana companies have gone public over the past few years in Canada, helping them finance expansion in the existing medical cannabis market and prepare to enter the nation’s recreational market, which is slated to open up in mid 2018. \nMarijuana stocks have posted strong gains over the past year, making the group one of the hottest sectors in the Canadian stock market. \nCannaRoyalty was one of the first CSE-listed firms to comment on the impact of the new U.S. policy. \n“We do not foresee the memorandum meaningfully impacting the way that existing cannabis business is conducted within legal states,” CannaRoyalty CEO Marc Lustig said in a statement. \nCarleton said he expects all firms to respond within days. \nThe others are: Alternate Health Corp ( AHG.CD ), MPX Bioceutical Corp MPX.CD, Nutritional High International Inc ( EAT.CD ), Golden Leaf Holdings Ltd ( GLH.CD ), iAnthus Capital Holdings Inc ( IAN.CD ), Marapharm Ventures Inc ( MDM.CD ), Friday Night Inc TGIF.CD, Vodis Pharmaceuticals Inc ( VP.CD ), International Cannabrands Inc JUJUa.CD, CannTrust Holdings Inc ( TRST.CD ), NanoSphere Health Sciences Inc ( NSHS.CD ), Body and Mind Inc ( BAMM.CD ), High Hampton Holdings Corp ( HC.CD ), Wildflower Marijuana Inc ( SUN.CD ), and Tinley Beverage Company Inc ( TNY.CD ). \nSome 60 marijuana companies have listed on the CSE, choosing it over TMX Group Ltd’s ( X.TO ) larger Toronto Stock Exchange. TMX said in October that it might delist pot stocks with U.S. ties. \nTMX told Reuters via email on Thursday that its guidance on the matter from October stands.
