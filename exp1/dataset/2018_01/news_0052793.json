That compares with $6 billion in February 2015. \n“This agreement marks the beginning of the final phase of our restructuring and the creation of a new Noble as a focused and appropriately financed group set to capitalize on the high-growth Asian commodities sector,” Paul Brough, a restructuring specialist who was appointed Noble’s chairman this year, said in a statement. \nNoble did not name the creditors with which it struck a deal. \nBrough said the in-principle agreement will reduce Noble’s indebtedness to sustainable levels and in line with the company’s size and range of activities. \nHong Kong-headquartered Noble’s senior debt will halve to $1.7 billion from $3.4 billion under the restructuring proposal, which is subject to approval from shareholders and regulators and will be implemented through a court-led statutory procedure. \nNoble was founded in 1986 by Richard Elman, who rode a commodities bull run to build the company into one of the world’s biggest traders, but it was plunged into crisis in 2015 when Iceberg Research started questioning its accounts. Noble has stood by its accounts. \nElman is Noble’s biggest shareholder with a stake of a little more than 18 percent. Other large investors include sovereign wealth fund China Investment Corp and Orbis Investment Management. \nNoble said the restructuring proposes a debt-to-equity swap that, along with the issuance of equity to retain and incentivise the management team, is expected to result in dilution of existing shareholders’ interest in the company. \nIt said that senior debt holders would end up owning 70 percent of the company after the restructuring, with 20 percent owned by management and the rest by existing shareholders. \nNoble also plans to exchange $400 million of perpetual securities for an aggregate payment of up to $15 million, subject to approval from holders of its perpetual bonds. \nThe restructuring includes a three-year committed trade finance and hedging facility of up to $700 million for the company’s commodities trading businesses. \n($1 = 1.3107 Singapore dollars) Reporting by Anshuman Daga and Aradhana Aravindan; Additional reporting by Masayuki Kitano; Editing by David Goodman and Edwina Gibbs", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-30T04:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-30T06:00:50.048+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
