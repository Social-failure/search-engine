(NASDAQ: FDEF) announced today that net income for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2017, totaled $32.3 million, or $3.22 per diluted common share, compared to $28.8 million or $3.19 per diluted common share for the year ended December 31, 2016.\nFor the fourth quarter of 2017, First Defiance earned $9.4 million, or $0.92 per diluted common share compared to $7.4 million or $0.81 per diluted common share for the fourth quarter of 2016. The fourth quarter of 2017 results included an increase of $428,000 pre-tax ($278,000 after-tax), or $0.03 per diluted share from changing trust revenues to accrual basis accounting and securities gains of $160,000 pre-tax ($104,000 after-tax), or $0.01 per diluted share. Also, on December 22, 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act was enacted that required the Company to revalue its deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities as of December 31, 2017, to account for the future impact of the lower corporate tax rate on these deferred amounts. As a result of this revaluation, an increase to tax expense and a reduction to earnings of $154,000, or $0.02 per diluted share, negatively impacted the fourth quarter of 2017. The increase in tax expense reflects the company’s current best estimate, and as information becomes available, the company may update this estimate.\n“Our strong fourth quarter performance capped a very successful 2017 for First Defiance and provided substantial momentum as we progress into 2018. With fourth quarter earnings per share up 13.6% over last year, we’re pleased to announce our fifth consecutive year of record earnings performance,” said Donald P. Hileman, President and Chief Executive Officer of First Defiance Financial Corp. “While the new Tax Cuts and Jobs Act had only a minor impact on our fourth quarter earnings, we expect the lower tax rates to benefit future operations with added opportunities for growth, profitability and community investment.”\nNet interest income up compared to fourth quarter 2016\nNet interest income of $25.4 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 was up from $20.5 million in the fourth quarter of 2016. The increase was mostly attributable to the added operations from the Commercial Savings Bank (“CSB”) merger completed earlier in 2017. Net interest margin was 3.88% for the fourth quarter of 2017, down from 3.91% in the third quarter of 2017, but up from 3.76% in the fourth quarter of 2016. Yield on interest earning assets increased by 19 basis points to 4.35% in the fourth quarter of 2017 up from 4.16% in the fourth quarter of 2016. The cost of interest-bearing liabilities increased by 9 basis points in the fourth quarter of 2017 to 0.62% from 0.53% in the fourth quarter of 2016.\n“Our net interest income increase in the fourth quarter was driven by our strong balance sheet growth, while our margin tightened slightly in the quarter,” said Hileman. “Our loans and deposits expanded in the fourth quarter at annualized growth rates of 12.8% and 13.0% respectively, providing solid momentum for the new year.”\nNon-interest income up from fourth quarter 2016\nFirst Defiance’s non-interest income for the fourth quarter of 2017 was $9.9 million compared to $8.3 million in the fourth quarter of 2016. The increase in total non-interest income was largely due to the inclusion of operations from the CSB and Corporate One Benefits Agency, Inc. (“Corporate One”) mergers completed in 2017. In addition, the fourth quarter of 2017 included gains of $160,000 from the sale of securities and an increase in trust revenues of $428,000 attributable to a change to accrual basis accounting.\nMortgage banking income decreased to $1.7 million in the fourth quarter of 2017, down from $1.9 million in the fourth quarter of 2016 due to significantly lower refinancing volumes which were slightly offset by higher purchase volumes. Gains from the sale of mortgage loans decreased in the fourth quarter of 2017 to $1.1 million from $1.2 million in the fourth quarter of 2016. Mortgage loan servicing revenue was $945,000 in the fourth quarter of 2017, up slightly from $922,000 in the fourth quarter of 2016. First Defiance had a positive change in the valuation adjustment in mortgage servicing assets of $69,000 in the fourth quarter of 2017 compared to a positive adjustment of $241,000 in the fourth quarter of 2016.\nFor the fourth quarter of 2017, service fees and other charges were $3.1 million, up $365,000 from $2.7 million in the fourth quarter of 2016; and commissions from the sale of insurance products were $3.0 million, up $704,000 from $2.3 million in the fourth quarter of 2016. Trust income was $932,000 in the fourth quarter of 2017, up from $445,000 in the fourth quarter of 2016 and included $428,000 for the adjustment to accrual basis accounting.\n“Total non-interest income in the fourth quarter grew $1.6 million, or 19.3% over the same quarter of last year, despite a decline in our mortgage business,” said Hileman. “We believe this demonstrates both the benefits of our mergers and the diversity of our revenues, as non-interest revenues from all other sources were up versus the prior year.”\nNon-interest expenses up from fourth quarter 2016\nTotal non-interest expense was $21.1 million in the fourth quarter of 2017, up from $18.2 million in the fourth quarter of 2016. The increase in non-interest expenses was mostly due to the additional expenses from the operations of CSB and Corporate One mergers completed in 2017. Compensation and benefits in the fourth quarter of 2017 was $12.3 million, an increase of $2.3 million compared to the fourth quarter of 2016. Occupancy expense was $2.0 million in the fourth quarter 2017, down $26,000 from the fourth quarter 2016. Data processing cost was $1.9 million in the fourth quarter of 2017, up $261,000 from the fourth quarter of 2016. Other non-interest expense was $4.0 million in the fourth quarter of 2017, increasing by $88,000 from the fourth quarter of 2016.\nCredit quality\nNon-performing loans totaled $30.7 million at December 31, 2017, an increase from $14.3 million at December 31, 2016. In addition, First Defiance had $1.5 million of real estate owned at December 31, 2017, up from $455,000 at December 31, 2016. Accruing troubled debt restructured loans were $13.8 million at December 31, 2017, an increase from $10.5 million at December 31, 2016.\nThe fourth quarter of 2017 results include net recoveries of $28,000 and a provision for loan losses of $314,000 compared with net recoveries of $110,000 and a credit provision of $149,000 for the same period in 2016.\nThe allowance for loan loss as a percentage of total loans was 1.14% at December 31, 2017, compared with 1.16% at September 30, 2017, and 1.33% at December 31, 2016. The decrease in the allowance for loan loss as a percentage of total loans versus a year ago was primarily attributable to the CSB acquisition. The CSB loans acquired were recorded at fair value with purchase accounting adjustments discounting the loan balance instead of an allowance for loan losses. For the CSB loans acquired, the discount recorded totaled $3.9 million, or 1.9% of acquired CSB loans at December 31, 2017.\n“Our non-performing loans to total assets at year-end remained relatively stable with the prior quarter at 1.08%; and importantly, net recoveries of $28,000 in the fourth quarter continued our favorable net loss experience from the previous quarter,” said Hileman. “Reducing our non-performing loans is a high priority in 2018.”\nAnnual results\nNet income for the full year ended on December 31, 2017, totaled $32.3 million, or $3.22 per diluted common share, compared to $28.8 million or $3.19 per diluted common share for 2016. The year 2017 includes the results from the operations of the CSB acquisition completed on February 24, 2017, and Corporate One acquired on April 1, 2017. In addition, 2017 includes merger and conversion expenses related to the acquisitions of $4.0 million, which had an after tax impact of $2.8 million, or $0.28 per diluted share.\nNet interest income for 2017 totaled $96.7 million, compared with $78.9 million for 2016. Average interest-earning assets increased to $2.55 billion for 2017, compared to $2.17 billion in 2016. Net interest margin for 2017 was 3.88%, up 14 basis points from the 3.74% margin for 2016.\nThe provision for loan losses for 2017 was $2.9 million, compared to $283,000 for 2016.\nNon-interest income for the year 2017 was $40.1 million, compared to $34.0 million in 2016. The year 2017 includes the operating results from the CSB and Corporate One mergers completed in 2017, a $1.5 million enhancement value gain related to the purchase of bank owned life insurance in the first quarter of 2017, and the aforementioned increase in trust revenues of $428,000 related to a change to accrual basis accounting.\nService fees and other charges were $12.1 million for 2017, up from $10.9 million in 2016. Mortgage banking income decreased to $7.0 million for 2017, compared to $7.3 million in 2016. Gains on the sale of non-mortgage loans were $217,000 for 2017, compared to $753,000 in 2016. Insurance commissions increased to $12.9 million for 2017, compared to $10.4 million in 2016. Non-interest income for 2017 included $584,000 of net securities gains compared to $509,000 of net securities gains for 2016.\nNon-interest expense increased to $85.4 million for 2017 from $71.1 million in 2016. Included in non-interest expense for 2017 were merger and conversion expenses of $4.0 million related to acquisitions. Compensation and benefits expense was $49.8 million for 2017 compared with $40.2 million for 2016. Expenses also included increases in occupancy expense of $289,000, data processing expense of $1.4 million, amortization of intangibles of $754,000 and other expense of $2.1 million.\nTotal assets at $2.99 billion\nTotal assets at December 31, 2017, were $2.99 billion compared to $2.48 billion at December 31, 2016. The increase reflected at December 31, 2017, is primarily due to the acquisition of CSB effective February 24, 2017, which added $368.3 million to total assets, net of $12.3 million paid in cash, at consummation.\nNet loans receivable (excluding loans held for sale) were $2.32 billion at December 31, 2017, compared to $1.91 billion at December 31, 2016. The acquisition of CSB added $285.4 million to the loan portfolio. At December 31, 2017, excluding the CSB acquired loans; net loans receivable grew $121.9 million, or 6.4% from a year ago.\nAlso, at December 31, 2017, goodwill and other intangible assets totaled $104.3 million compared to $63.1 million at December 31, 2016.

The acquisition of CSB in 2017 added $56.5 million to total equity.\nDividend to be paid February 23\nThe Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.30 per common share payable February 23, 2018, to shareholders of record at the close of business on February 16, 2018.
