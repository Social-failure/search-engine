No superpower is capable of offering Jerusalem to Israel, there is no Israel that it should have a capital named Jerusalem.” \nThe three groups designated by the State Department are: \n- Harakat al-Sabireen, which the statement said is backed by Iran, operates primarily in Gaza and the West Bank, and fired rockets into Israel; \n- Liwa al-Thawra, which it said has claimed responsibility for killing an Egyptian army general in Cairo in 2016 and a bombing in 2017; \n- Harakat Sawa’d Misr (HASM), which it said claimed responsibility for killing an Egyptian security officer and other attacks. \nThe State Department designations deny Haniyeh and the three groups access to the U.S. financial system.
