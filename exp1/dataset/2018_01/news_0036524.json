He is leaving the bank to pursue other opportunities, the Swiss bank said in a statement on Monday, confirming a Reuters story of last week.\nIn October, Chow was named CEO for Greater China to lead the bank’s strategy across its private banking and investment banking platform.\nThe veteran dealmaker’s exit from Credit Suisse comes at a time when capital markets and M&A activities in Asia Pacific, mainly in China, are set to pick up this year, amid intensifying competition among investment banks.\nZeth Hung will take over the responsibility of Asia Pacific co-head of investment banking and capital markets, while Carsten Stoehr will become the chief executive for Greater China, which includes Hong Kong, Credit Suisse said.\nHung was earlier heading the bank’s Greater China investment banking and capital markets business. Stoehr will retain current roles as head of the Asia Pacific financing group and chairman of the board of the bank’s Hong Kong and local securities units.\nBoth Hung and Stoehr will report to Helman Sitohang, Credit Suisse’s Asia Pacific chief executive.\nCredit Suisse ranked sixth in the Asia Pacific (excluding Japan) M&A fee ranking league table in 2017, lagging its global peers including Morgan Stanley, Goldman Sachs, and UBS, according to Thomson Reuters data.\nIn the equity capital markets (ECM) business, which includes initial public offerings, the Swiss bank was ranked ninth in the bookrunners’ league table last year, up from 15th in the previous year, the data showed.
