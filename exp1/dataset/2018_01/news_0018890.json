He also said he would “absolutely” be willing to talk on the phone to Kim.\n“Look, right now they’re talking Olympics. It’s a start, it’s big start,” he said. “If something can happen and something come out of those talks, that would be a great thing for all of humanity, that would be a great thing for the world,” he said.\nTrump said he would like to see talks go beyond the Olympics and added: “At the appropriate time, we’ll get involved.”\nSouth Korea’s President Moon Jae-in persuaded the United States to delay joint military exercises until after the Olympics in a bid to reduce tensions and possibly create room for diplomacy.\nThe talks come after North Korea’s Kim used his New Year’s Day speech to announce he was open to sending a delegation to the Olympics as well as generally reducing tensions on the Korean peninsula, while vowing to never give up his nuclear weapons program.\nThe Trump administration has said that any future talks between the United States and North Korea must be aimed at denuclearization.\nBaek said other issues aimed at boosting cooperation between the two Koreas will be discussed.\nUnification Minister Cho Myong-gyon has said his delegation has been preparing to discuss resuming reunions of family members separated by the Korean War. That conflict ended in a ceasefire and technically the two sides remain at war.\nNorth Korea’s delegation will be led by Ri Son Gwon, chairman of the North’s Committee for the Peaceful Reunification of the Fatherland. Committee vice chairman Jon Song Su and Hwang Chung Song, a director, will join Ri.\nRi, the committee chairman who was promoted to his current position in June 2016, is a seasoned negotiator for inter-Korean talks although his previous experience has mostly been military-related due to his career in the armed forces.
