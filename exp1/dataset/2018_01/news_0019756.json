Now, a leading activist investor and a pension fund—Jana Partners LLC and the California State Teachers’ Retirement System, or Calstrs—think it’s time for the world’s most valuable company to address what some think is a public-health crisis : phone use addiction among the young. Apple, meanwhile, defended its record of providing parental controls and other protections for children who use its iPhones and other devices.\nSome schools have banned smartphones as a nuisance, while the rise in smartphone use among teenagers has been linked by one recent study to an increase in depression and suicide. Still, how to address the issue and whether it constitutes a societal crisis is far from settled, which brings us to the question we’ve presented to our readers: Is smartphone addiction among young people a public-health concern? And should companies like Apple be held to task for tackling the issue?\nBelow is a selection of comments received via email and social media. Reader reactions spanned from asserting that policing smartphone usage should fall to parents, while others agreed that it was up to manufacturers like Apple to take an active role in promoting healthy habits—some fell somewhere in between. Many parents offered specific suggestions for better controls in place to regulate smartphone use. Responses have been edited for style and clarity.\n‘Learning Has Become Difficult’ “I am a high school counselor, and I find the overuse of the iPhone disrupting students ability to learn, socialize and have true compassion for their fellow students. The amount of constant bullying through the phone that doesn’t end when school lets out is troubling to say the least. Learning for students has become more difficult. Students attention span is very minimal, and when tasks require students to delve deeper into learning more abstract concepts, they can’t apply themselves. I wish we could get rid of the phone in high schools altogether. Give the students phones back to them at the end of the day. As a final note, the amount of mental health issues we see in today’s students is a result of a disconnectedness from real social interaction. I support companies that want to do something about this crisis with our youth.” —Claudia Rodems\n‘Responsibility of a Parent’ My opinion is that the issue is a parental one, not a corporate one. Children learn from their parents, and parents are on their phones just as much as their children, if not more so; it is the responsibility of a parent to monitor and regulate mobile phone usage by their children. During kindergarten through 12th grade, school administrators share that responsibility during school hours. Outside of that, medical professionals may want to increase awareness of the dangers of mobile phone use for extended periods of time, including neck and thumb injury. —Adam Harris\n‘iOS Provides Minimal Support to Parents’ ‘Whack-a-Mole Game From Hell’ The battle parents face everyday to try to limit their child’s use of devices and exposure to inappropriate content is exhausting. It is almost an hourly fight. I describe it like the whack-a-mole game from hell. Once you take the phone away they are on their laptop, once you take the laptop away they are on the smart TV. Then you have to turn around and give them their laptop back because they can’t do their homework without it since all assignments and books are online.\nI absolutely hate schools for forcing our kids online for everything. I have said it’s like telling an alcoholic we have to have this business meeting in a bar, but don’t order a drink.\nI pray they come up with containment solutions to the monster they have created. —Julie Thompson\n‘Parents and Tech Companies Play a Role’ ‘Industry Has Looked the Other Way’ Whether it’s a public health issue is a matter of semantics, but I would say no. However, to date the industry has looked the other way when it comes to making it easy for parents to limit unwanted behavior. Clearly phone makers and carriers, on one level, want the high usage.\nParents desperately need better options than just taking the phone away, which of course still has its place. We need controls that allow basic messaging and internet access for homework, while limiting or blocking mindless social media activity. —Ben Knox\n‘A Slow-Motion Train Wreck’ “Ask ANY parent, guardian, child psychologist, school psychologist, teacher, principal, coach, etc. of a millennial or iGen/zGen—we’ve all known and lived with this developing mental health issue for YEARS.\nMany of us have contacted Apple directly begging them to develop time limits and more advanced parental controls, only to be lied to, ignored or told that there are third-party apps available to manage our ‘uncontrollable’ children.\nThis is a mental-health crisis—a slow-motion train wreck happening in broad daylight. Apple has known of this issue for years and has buried or ignored it. This issue is on par with the tobacco, alcohol, big pharma and air bag industries turning a blind eye to the problems their products created. They will only pay attention when it will costs them money, reputation or market share.” —Patrick M. Keane\n‘Parents Not Doing Their Job’ “I agree that children using cellphones is a major issue. But, the issue isn’t created by Apple. It is created by parents not doing their job. Too often, we look for someone else blame for our foolish behavior and bad choices. I see too many people that don’t accept responsibility for themselves and their children.” —William Weeks\n‘A Serious Issue’ “I am an Apple investor and have been for many years. However, I agree with Jana Partners and Calstrs and that smartphone usage in young adults is a serious issue. We just recently told our 13-year-old daughter that her iPhone usage will be drastically reduced, almost to the point of taking it away completely. On Sunday, my wife did take it away from her and amazingly, after two hours of sulking, she actually began to interact with my wife and me and her younger sister. She used to be an avid reader, but the phone replaced it. We told her to provide her friends with our home phone number and that they could talk that way! You can imagine that reaction. I could go on and on.\nI believe it is up to us as parents to control the usage of the phones and not necessarily the company that produces the product just as Mr. Rich references at the end of the article.\nThank you for publishing the article.” —Jamison Gagnier\n‘Generation With No Real Communication Skills’ “Thank you for this article. I do believe smartphones are helping create a generation of youth who have NO real communication skills. I witnessed this in my own children (12 years between oldest and youngest). I always encouraged my children in high school and college to invite friends on spring break trips to Jackson, Wy. With my older children, we sat at dinner together, we sat in front of the fire (that they lit and kept going) and talked about their day, current events, job searches, peer pressure... often more info than I needed! We watched March Madness, we played cards. When my youngest child came along, things were quite different. His friends never offered to help do ANYTHING!
