It was not immediately clear how widespread the backing for the new movement was among CNRP members. \nAccording to the statement, the CNRM’s members include Sam Rainsy, his wife Saumura Tioulong and deputy presidents of the now dissolved CNRP, Eng Chhai Eang and Mu Sochua. \n“We invite our compatriots from all walks of life, regardless of their political affiliation, to join the CNRM in order to protect the will of the Cambodian people through free, fair and inclusive elections,” the statement said. \nThey said in the statement that they also demand the release of Kem Sokha and other politician prisoners of conscience. \nHuy Vannak, undersecretary of state at the Interior Ministry, called the movement “desperate” and that Sam Rainsy is “a serial loser.” \n“I advise the people on this list about the spirit of the Cambodian Supreme Court’s decision on the prohibition of political rights and to avoid taking illegal or guerrilla acts leading to the harm of innocents and the destruction of Cambodians,” he said. \nThe Supreme Court’s decision also banned more than 118 CNRP members from politics ahead of the general election on July 29. \nRights groups have decried an ongoing crackdown against the political opposition and independent media. One group called the CNRP’s dissolution the death of democracy in the country. \nReporting by Prak Chan Thul; Editing by Simon Cameron-Moore\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-14T10:13:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-14T10:32:00.010+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
