Her orange leggings and kurta, a loose knee-length shirt, now hang on racks alongside outfits of all styles.\nThey include the pants, pink tank top and pink shirt that twenty-six-year-old fashion designer Eeshita Kapadiya was wearing when she was harassed.\n“Garments help people see it as it was and realize that it doesn’t matter what you are wearing when you are harassed or abused,” said Kapadiya, who declined to give details of the harassment she suffered.\nThe ActionAid survey found that almost 80 percent of Indian women in India are subject to harassment and assault that ranges from staring, insults and wolf-whistling, to being followed, groped or even raped.\nIt occurs on the street, in parks, at community events, on college campuses and on public transport, campaigners say.\nSameera Khan, co-author of Why Loiter?, a book about the risks for women on Mumbai’s streets, said that Blank Noise, as well as women like Kapadiya and Karunagaran, are making a powerful and long overdue statement.\n“Campaigns like this firmly put the blame back on the perpetrators,” she said.\nReporting by Anuradha Nagaraj, Editing by Jared Ferrie; Please credit the Thomson Reuters Foundation, the charitable arm of Thomson Reuters, that covers humanitarian news, women's rights, trafficking and climate change.
