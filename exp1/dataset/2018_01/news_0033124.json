This week, women-focused motorshows opened in Jeddah and Riyadh and a decades-long ban on screening films in the conservative kingdom was lifted. \nMeanwhile, the New York-based Human Rights Watch said, more than a dozen prominent political activists convicted on “vague charges arising from their peaceful activities” were serving lengthy prison sentences. \n“Mohammad bin Salman’s well-funded image as a reformist falls flat in the face of Yemen’s humanitarian catastrophe and scores of activists and political dissidents languishing in Saudi prisons on spurious charges,” said Sarah Leah Whitson, Middle East director at Human Rights Watch. \n“Baby steps on women’s rights reforms don’t paper over Saudi Arabia’s systemic abuses.” Reporting by Dubai newsroom; Editing by Mark Heinrich", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-18T22:56:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-18T23:17:58.009+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
