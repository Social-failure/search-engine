Between 5-10 percent of patients with breast cancer have a BRCA mutation.\nPatients are selected for treatment based on a diagnostic test made by Myriad Genetics Inc known as BRACAnalysis CDx. In 2014 Myriad won FDA approval for the test to help identify patients with advanced ovarian cancer considered eligible for treatment with the drug after others have failed.\nIn July AstraZeneca and Merck & Co announced a global strategic oncology collaboration to jointly co-develop and co-commercialize Lynparza, an oral treatment known also as olaparib, for multiple cancer type, both as a monotherapy and in combination with other potential drugs.\nReporting by Toni Clarke in Washington; Editing by Nick Zieminski and Susan Thomas\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-01-13T00:02:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-12T18:23:53.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
