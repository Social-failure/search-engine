[nL8N1PB4GZ]\nSources estimate top consumer China imports about 95 percent of gold in kilobars, while world No. 2 consumer India imports 80 percent in kilobars. The WGC estimates China’s gold demand at 900 to 1,000 tonnes last year and India’s at 650 tonnes.\nGold contracts on the Shanghai Gold Exchange, Shanghai Futures Exchange and Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing are in kilobars.\n“The Asian consumer market is in kilobars, it dominates gold trade,” a gold industry source said. “If you want to trade on the LME and you want to lodge your collateral in kilobars in another location, why shouldn’t you be able to? There are vaults all over the world.”\nBrinks, London-listed G4S and Loomis International provide gold storage facilities around the world.\nVaults in London as of September 2017 held 7,743 tonnes of gold, worth $334 billion at today’s prices, LBMA data shows.\nThe gold vaulting business in London is dominated by LBMA members JP Morgan and HSBC, the two largest gold traders in London’s over-the-counter market with total traded volumes estimated at about $5 trillion a year.\nThe gold they hold is on the LBMA’s Good Delivery list, which was defined in 1750 by the Bank of England. The LBMA was founded in 1987 to oversee that list.\nHowever, the London market was designed for central banks, many of which have diversified reserves into currencies and government bonds, so are no longer as active in the gold market.\n“What (London has) in place is a simple standardized format that allows large volume trade. The large bar format doesn’t work outside London,” the physical gold trading source said.\n“Kilobars should be included in the London Good Delivery list, it would be less costly and more efficient for a lot of people, but it is not in the interests of some LBMA members.”\nAnyone wanting to deliver kilobars in London has to accept a deep discount from the vault owners on the value of their gold or they have to be melted and remoulded into Good Delivery bars.\nSources say refiners are split on the idea of encouraging the use of kilobars, with those opposed worrying about the loss of income from remoulding.\nSupporters say it would boost the market, particularly if the identification process used blockchain, scrapping paper documents for their digital equivalent and giving the buyer the assurance the gold had not been mined to finance a conflict.\n“You can add a lot of information with blockchain, where the gold was mined, where it was refined, serial numbers, who owned it previously. It could bring new demand to the market,” a physical market source said.\nReporting by Pratima Desai; Additional reporting by Jan Jarvey; Editing by Veronica Brown and Edmund Blair\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-01-22T21:12:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-22T19:12:28.002+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
