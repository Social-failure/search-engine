As of Jan. 1, provision charges were 2.6 times larger than overdue loans, Sberbank said.\nRussian accounting standards often act as an early indicator of the bank’s subsequent IFRS figures.\n$1 = 56.4477 roubles Writing by Polina Ivanova; Editing by Andrey Ostroukh and Louise Heavens\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-01-15T20:29:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-16T13:14:03.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
