Ankara has criticized Germany’s refusal to hand over asylum seekers it says were involved in the failed putsch. \nAdding to the tension, the German government believes seven Germans, of whom four have dual citizenship, are being held in prison in Turkey for political reasons. \nBut in a sign of recovering relations, Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu said the NATO allies believed they could overcome recent escalations in tension through dialogue. \nCavusoglu said Turkey and Germany shared similar views on conflict-hit Middle East countries and they were cooperating on humanitarian issues like migration.

THORNY ISSUES \nBut the pair acknowledged areas of disagreement. Cavusoglu said one bone of contention was whether Turkey should be allowed to join the European Union - a move that Germany opposes - but he sounded a conciliatory note.

REUTERS/Ralph Orlowski \n“There is benefit in pushing our disagreements aside and continuing on our path. We should focus on issues that serve as win-win for our countries, like the Customs Union,” he said. \nOne of the disputes between Berlin and Ankara centres around the arrest of Deniz Yucel, a reporter for German newspaper Die Welt. Turkish authorities accuse him of spreading propaganda for the outlawed Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK). He denies the charge. \nGabriel said he had discussed thorny issues including Yucel’s case with Cavusoglu but did not give details. \nGermany is Turkey’s biggest trade partner but exports from Europe’s largest economy to Turkey dropped by 5.9 percent year-on-year in the first nine months of 2017. \nGabriel told magazine Der Spiegel on Friday Germany had refused to authorise “a large number of arms exports” to Turkey and that would remain the case until Yucel’s case was resolved. \nBut on Saturday he said the German government would consider whether to deliver mine protection gear for armoured vehicles in Turkey, an issue not linked to arrests, he said.
