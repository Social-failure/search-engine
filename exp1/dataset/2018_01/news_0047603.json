But I‘m training really hard now and determined to do all that I possibly can through hard work to try and win my place back.” \nRobertson, who signed from Hull City in the close season, has started nine of Liverpool’s last 10 games and the 23-year-old Scot has added energy and aggression from the back. \n“You’ve got to be absolutely honest and sincere and say that he’s doing really well. He’s put in some great performances and played some great matches,” Moreno added. \n“It was tough for him at the start of the season, not being involved, I‘m sure. It’s also never easy to come into the first team mid-season, so I think he’s coped with that really well.” \nLiverpool take on West Bromwich Albion in the fourth round of the FA Cup on Saturday before travelling to Huddersfield Town in the Premier League on Jan. 31.
