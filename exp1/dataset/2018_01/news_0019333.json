The game was tied for the 13th time at 64-64 when Stevens hit a go-ahead layup with under six minutes left to give Ole Miss the lead for good.\nForward Egor Koulechov and guard Jalen Hudson scored 11 points each for the Gators. Hudson, the team’s leading scorer with a 16.6 average entering the game, fouled out with 40 seconds left after a replay review overturned what would have been his fifth foul with 1:46 remaining.\nThe two teams were deadlocked at 31-31 at the half when Florida guard KeVaughn Allen drilled a 3-pointer from the wing at the buzzer.\nThe Gators led by as many as seven points, 17-10, after going on an 8-0 run midway through the first half and were still up by four, 22-20, on Koulechov’s 3-pointer before the Rebels rallied.\nTwo free throws by Marcanvis Hymon at the 3:30 mark put the Rebels up 27-25, and Crawford’s jumper with under a minute left in the period had Ole Miss up 31-28, but Burnett forced a layup with 24 seconds remaining to give Florida its late opportunity.\nThe Gators shot well early in the period but cooled off and ended up shooting only 35.5 percent (11-of-31) for the half. The Rebels slogged their way to a 30.3 percent first half (10-of-33).\n--Field Level Media\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-01-14T04:56:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-14T20:27:43.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
