They have been fantastic all week. We had a really good group and we worked hard,” Bjorn said after Pieters beat An Byeong-un of South Korea 1-up to seal Europe’s triumph. \n“It was mostly up to them last night and they wanted to go out and show what they are really about and they certainly did that today.” \nBelgian Pieters raced to a 4-up lead against An but the South Korean fought back to level the match. Pieters then holed a seven-foot putt at the 15th to regain the lead and then won the next hole to ensure his team would retain the trophy. \n“It’s always nice to get the winning point,” he said. “I got off to a good start, then played pretty poorly during the middle, then made a couple of very good birdies.” \nAlex Noren started Europe’s charge in the first game when he erased Asia’s slender advantage with a 4 and 2 win over Malaysian Nicholas Fung. \nRafa Cabrera Bello then beat Gavin Green 4 and 3 to put the defending champions ahead before 2017 Race to Dubai winner Tommy Fleetwood gave Europe their third point in a row with a 2 and 1 victory against S.S.P Chawrasia of India. \nPoom Saksansin cut the deficit when he beat Paul Casey 1-up but Henrik Stenson re-established a two-point cushion with his 2 and 1 win over Hideto Tanihara. \nBernd Wiesberger and Alex Levy recorded respective victories over Thailand’s Phachara Khongwatmai and Kiradech Aphibarnrat to put Europe on the cusp of victory before Pieters gave Europe an unassailable lead. \nEnglishman Tyrrell Hatton continued his strong form with a 2 and 1 win over India’s Anirban Lahiri for his third point of the week, before South Korean Kang Sung-hoon denied Matthew Fitzpatrick victory with two late birdies in their halved match. \nAtwal’s side won the final two matches to add some respectability to the scoreline with China’s Li Haotong and Yuta Ikeda of Japan beating Paul Dunne and Ross Fisher.
