At least two people were killed.\nSome legislators opposed to the law tried unsuccessfully at various stages to filibuster it and some were suspended from proceedings. During the final debate on the amendment last month, some lawmakers scuffled with police.\nMuseveni is the latest of a growing list of African leaders who have either changed the law or used other tactics to thwart opponents and hold onto power long after their tenure has ended.\nIn Burundi, Democratic Republic of Congo and South Sudan, such moves have provoked instability.\nLast month’s vote by parliament was the second time the Ugandan legislature has amended the constitution to allow Museveni to stay in power. In 2005 they voted to remove a limit of two five-year terms, which had blocked him from standing again.\nDespite the growing cries of autocracy against Museveni, Washington has backed him as a strongman who has turned Uganda into a bulwark of stability in Africa’s troubled Great Lakes region.\nThe landlocked East African country is eyeing commencement of crude production in 2020 and the construction of a pipeline to export it via neighboring Tanzania is underway.\nReporting by Elias Biryabarema; Editing by Maggie Fick and Gareth Jones\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-01-03T00:05:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-02T18:13:34.002+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
