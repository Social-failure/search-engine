(the “Company”) (OTC Pink Marketplace: FCBI), the parent company for Frederick County Bank (“FCB”), announced today that, for the quarter ended December 31, 2017, the Company recorded net income of $341 thousand and diluted earnings per share of $0.22, as compared to net income of $149 thousand and diluted earnings per share of $0.10 recorded for the fourth quarter of 2016. The Company earned $2.1 million with diluted earnings per share of $1.32 for the year ended on December 31, 2017, as compared to $1.3 million in earnings and diluted earnings per share of $0.82 for the same period in 2016.\nThe increase in quarterly earnings was due primarily to increases in net interest income of $201 thousand and in total noninterest income of $57 thousand and a decrease in total noninterest expense of $108 thousand in the fourth quarter of 2017 as compared to the third quarter of 2016, respectively. A provision for loan losses in the amount of $281 thousand was recorded in the fourth quarter of 2017, while a provision for loan losses of $600 thousand was recognized in the same quarter of 2016. The provision for income taxes increased by $493 thousand in the fourth quarter of 2017 as compared to the same period of 2016 due to a higher level of pre-tax income and the recognition of a decrease in the deferred tax assets of $231 thousand in 2017 due to the reduction in the federal corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21% enacted in December 2017 and effective January 1, 2018. The Company’s effective tax rate was 34% at the time of enactment.\nThe increase in full-year earnings was due primarily to increases in net interest income of $908 thousand and in total noninterest income of $610 thousand in the full year of 2017 as compared to the same period in 2016, respectively. The increase in total noninterest income was due primarily to increases in securities gains of $365 thousand, gain on sale of loans of $187 thousand, and in other operating income of $118 thousand in the full year of 2017 as compared to the same period in 2016. The provision for income taxes increased by $914 thousand in the full year of 2017 as compared to the same period of 2016 due to a higher level of pre-tax income and the recognition of a decrease in the deferred tax assets of $231 thousand in 2017 due to the reduction in the federal corporate income tax rate.\nEarnings in 2017 benefitted from the continued emphasis on Small Business Administration (SBA) loans as reflected in the year on year increases in gain on sale of loans. For two years in a row FCB has been recognized as a top 10 SBA lender in the greater Baltimore area.\nThe ratio of the allowance for loan losses to total loans stood at 1.01% and 1.22% as of December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The improvement in loan asset quality was the driver behind the reduction in the ratio of the allowance to total loans at December 31, 2017. Total nonperforming assets stood at $5.4 million and $7.4 million at December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The corresponding nonperforming assets to total assets ratios were 1.32% and 1.96% as of December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.\nThe Company also reported that, as of December 31, 2017, assets stood at $405.8 million, with total deposits of $332.0 million and gross loans of $322.2 million, representing increases of 7.1%, 3.1%, and 5.2%, respectively, compared to December 31, 2016. Total shareholders’ equity at December 31, 2017 was $32.6 million, an increase of $1.5 million from December 31, 2016. The increase primarily resulted from an increase in retained earnings of $1.6 million. On a per share basis, book value increased by $0.96 for 2017 to $21.85 per share at December 31, 2017 from $20.89 per share at December 31, 2016. The dividends declared per share were $0.30 for the twelve month period ended December 31, 2017 as compared to $0.28 per share for the same period in 2016. On December 18, 2017 and October 2, 2017, the Board declared quarterly dividends of $0.08 per share, an increase of $0.01 per share relative to prior quarters.\nFrederick County Bank is headquartered in Frederick, Maryland, and conducts full service commercial banking services through five bank centers located in Frederick County, Maryland.\nDecember 31,\nDecember 31, 2017 2016 (dollars in thousands) (unaudited) (audited) Total assets $405,796 $378,753 Loans 322,156 306,599 Deposits 332,005 321,952 Shareholders’ equity 32,621 31,161 Nonperforming assets: Nonaccrual loans $3,756 $6,172 Accruing troubled debt restructurings 345 405 Loans 90 days or more past due and still accruing -\n- Foreclosed properties 1,264 866 Total nonperforming assets $5,365 $7,443 For the Three Months Ended For the Years Ended December 31, December 31, December 31, December 31, 2017 2016 2017 2016 (dollars in thousands, except for per share data) (unaudited) (audited) (unaudited) (audited) SUMMARY OF OPERATING RESULTS: Net income $341 $149 $2,050 $1,257 Total comprehensive income $107 $277 $1,914 $1,802 Charge-offs $1,091 $- $1,369 $236 (Recoveries) (8) (22) (245) (66) Net charge-offs (recoveries) $1,083 $(22) $1,124 $170 PER COMMON SHARE DATA: Basic earnings per share $0.23 $0.10 $1.37 $0.85 Diluted earnings per share $0.22 $0.10 $1.32 $0.82 Basic weighted average number of shares outstanding 1,493,018 1,490,257 1,492,792 1,486,502 Diluted weighted average number of shares outstanding 1,554,769 1,542,745 1,551,807 1,542,119 Common shares outstanding 1,493,044 1,491,844 1,493,044 1,491,844 Dividends declared (1) $0.16 $0.07 $0.30 $0.28 Book value per share $21.85 $20.89 $21.85 $20.89 SELECTED UNAUDITED FINANCIAL RATIOS: Return on average assets 0.34% 0.16% 0.52% 0.34% Return on average equity 4.12% 1.90% 6.34% 4.09% Allowance for loan losses to total loans 1.01% 1.22% 1.01% 1.22% Nonperforming assets to total assets 1.32% 1.96% 1.32% 1.96% Ratio of net (recoveries) charge-offs to average loans 0.34% (0.01)% 0.36% 0.06% Common Equity Tier 1 to risk-weighted assets 8.72% 8.65% 8.72% 8.65% Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets 10.35% 10.35% 10.35% 10.35% Total capital to risk-weighted assets 11.23% 11.40% 11.23% 11.40% Tier 1 capital to average assets 9.65% 9.66% 9.65% 9.66% Average equity to average assets 8.34% 8.28% 8.16% 8.39% Net interest margin 3.58% 3.50% 3.59% 3.62% (1) Includes dividends of $0.08 per share declared on both October 2, 2017 and December 18, 2017.\nFrederick County Bancorp, Inc. and Subsidiaries Consolidated Balance Sheets December 31, December 31, 2017 2016 (unaudited) (audited) (dollars in thousands) ASSETS Cash and due from banks $ 2,726 $ 2,811 Federal funds sold 5 1,059 Interest-bearing deposits in other banks 34,628 25,804 Cash and cash equivalents 37,359 29,674 Investment securities available-for-sale at fair value 24,745 24,644 Restricted stock 2,367 1,687 Loans held for sale -

Forward-looking statements can generally be identified by the use of forward- looking terminology such as \"believes,\" \"expects,\" \"intends,\" \"may,\" \"will,\" \"should,\" \"anticipates\" or similar terminology. Such statements, specifically regarding the Company's intentions regarding growth and market expansion, are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from future results expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements. Potential risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, changes in interest rates, deposit flows, loan demand and real estate values, as well as changes in economic, competitive, governmental, regulatory, technological and other factors which may affect the Company specifically, its existing and target market areas or the banking industry generally. Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date they are made. The Company will not update forward-looking statements to reflect factual assumptions, circumstances or events that have changed after a forward-looking statement was made.\nView source version on businesswire.com : http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180123006240/en/\nFrederick County Bancorp, Inc.\nWilliam R.
