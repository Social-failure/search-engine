Hamouda Ben Jerad/via REUTERS \nWith temperatures touching 1 degree Celsius (33.8 Fahrenheit), residents in the northern Algerian town of Ain Sefra enjoyed sliding down the small sections of dunes on Sunday morning before the snow melted away. \nAin Sefra is known as the gateway to the Sahara desert, where temperatures regularly reach 35 degrees Celsius in July and August. \nFreezing conditions, however, are not uncommon in the area which lies between the desert and the Atlas mountains. Snow also fell in the region in December, 2016 for the first time in many years.
