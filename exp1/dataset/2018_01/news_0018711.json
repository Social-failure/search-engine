And it looks right that we are focused on this market and the oil producers are interested in going this way,” he told reporters.\nUrals prices have already strengthened on sparse supply. Its discount to dated Brent narrowed to an average of about $1 a barrel in 2017, Reuters data shows.\nThe biggest reduction for Russia’s key export blend, Urals, will be at Baltic Sea ports. Loadings from Primorsk and Ust-Luga are planned at 62 million tonnes for 2018, down by 14.7 million tonnes from last year.\nUrals and Siberian Light loadings from Black Sea’s Novorossiisk are planned at 27 million tonnes, according to Transneft. That is 3.7 million tonnes lower than in 2017 and the lowest level since 1999, Reuters data shows.\nUrals exports are seen drying up as Russia increases supplies to China under the Moscow-Beijing agreement to 30 million tonnes a year, starting in 2018.\nCrude oil supplies to China both via ESPO pipeline spur and Kazakhstan will increase to 38.3 million tones in 2018 from 26.7 million tonnes in 2017, Transneft data shows.\nHigher output at Russian refineries was also cited as a reason for lower exports by Transneft’s vice-president, Sergei Andronov.\nUrals exports through the Druzhba (Friendship) pipeline, which ships crude oil straight to the consumers in Europe, will remain stable in 2018.\nExports via Druzhba to Germany and Poland will be at 36 million tonnes in 2018 compared with 35.5 million tonnes in 2017, while exports to Czech Republic, Hungary and Slovakia will be unchanged from 2017 at 14 million tonnes, Transneft data shows.\nReporting by Vladimir Soldatkin; Writing by Olga Yagova; Editing by David Goodman\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-01-12T20:14:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-13T14:41:09.017+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
