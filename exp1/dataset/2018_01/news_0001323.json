Slideshow (2 Images) \nNeither Boeing nor Embraer responded to requests for comment. \nOn Dec. 21, the two planemakers said they were discussing a “potential combination,” in a move that could consolidate a global passenger jet duopoly. \nThe talks are widely seen as a way for Boeing to strengthen its position in the regional jetliner market, in which Embraer is strong, thanks largely to its 70- to 130-seat E-Jets. \nLess than three months ago, Boeing’s European arch-rival Airbus SE ( AIR.PA ) agreed to buy a majority stake in Bombardier Inc’s ( BBDb.TO ) 100- to 130-seat CSeries jet, putting pressure on the U.S. planemaker to seek a similar partnership. \nThe Boeing-Embraer talks involve Embraer’s defense business, as well as its passenger business, sources have said. \nIn the Tuesday report, Valor said Boeing was confident it could convince Brazil’s government that it could safely operate in Brazil’s defense sector, partially by pointing to defense deals the U.S. planemaker has made in countries such as Australia.
