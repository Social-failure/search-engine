The incident took place in the mountainous Yarumal municipality. \nIn the nearby municipality of Caceres, hundreds of people were displaced from their homes over the weekend by fighting between illegal armed groups, Antioquia’s provincial government said on its website. \nThe ELN, FARC dissidents who refused to demobilize and crime gangs are also involved in illegal mining of gold, extortion and other crimes. The government has sent thousands of additional soldiers to troubled areas in a bid to improve security. \nThe ELN is holding peace talks with the Colombian government in Quito, but the talks were recently interrupted when the group stepped up its attacks after the end of a ceasefire. \nThe Gulf Clan has repeatedly expressed a desire to come to a surrender agreement with Colombia’s government, which has said it will not negotiate with criminal groups.
