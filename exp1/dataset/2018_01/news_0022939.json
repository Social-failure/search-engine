Whereas in Papua, we have problems, difficulties with drugs and medical workers.” \nOne minister denied the extent of the health crisis had taken the government by surprise. \n“We have anticipated this since September 2017,” Puan Maharani, the coordinating minister for human development, told reporters. \n“The location in Asmat is not easy to monitor. We have asked the health ministry to coordinate for this (health crisis) to be evaluated.” Reporting by Kanupriya Kapoor, Agustinus Beo Da Costa and Maikel Jeffriando; Writing by Ed Davies; Editing by Clarence Fernandez", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-17T08:46:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-17T08:54:02.005+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
