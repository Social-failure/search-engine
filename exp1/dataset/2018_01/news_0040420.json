A member of the security forces was also killed.\n“An explosion rocked the area and right after that children and people started running away,” said Ghulam Nabi, who was nearby when the bomb exploded. “I saw a vehicle catch fire and then a gunfight started.”\nIslamic State said the attack targeted British, Swedish and Afghan government institutions in a statement on its Amaq news agency. Save the Children was founded in Britain and a Swedish aid group office and a building of the Afghan Department of Women’s Affairs are near the compound.\nThe attack underlines how difficult operating in Afghanistan has become for humanitarian aid bodies, which have faced heavy pressure from armed groups and kidnappers.\nSave the Children, which says it reaches almost 1.4 million children in Afghanistan, said it had suspended its operations temporarily and closed its offices in Afghanistan\n“Our primary concern remains to secure the safety of all of our staff,” a group representative said in an emailed statement.\nAfghan security forces arrive at the site of a blast and gun fire in Jalalabad, Afghanistan January 24, 2018. REUTERS/Parwiz “We remain committed to resuming our operations and lifesaving work as quickly as possible, as soon as we can be assured that it is safe to do so.”\n‘OUTRAGEOUS’\nIn October, the Red Cross said it was drastically reducing operations in Afghanistan following attacks that killed seven of its staff.\n“An attack against an organization that helps children is outrageous. Civilians and aid workers must not be targeted,” said Monica Zanarelli, head of the Red Cross delegation in Afghanistan, in response to Wednesday’s attack.\nSlideshow (14 Images) “Increased violence has made operating in Afghanistan increasingly difficult for many organizations.”\nPlumes of black smoke rose from the area as the surviving gunmen battled special forces.\nA police officer said at least one attacker had blown himself up in the initial suicide assault and another had been killed. Schoolchildren and residents fled as Afghan special forces arrived to engage the militants.\nBy late afternoon, Khogyani said one attacker was still holding out, battling the security forces, and 45 people had taken refuge in a fortified “safe room” in the compound.\nJalalabad is the capital of Nangarhar province on the porous border with Pakistan. The province has become a stronghold of Islamic State, which has grown into one of Afghanistan’s most dangerous militant groups since it appeared around the beginning of 2015.\nBacked by intensive U.S. air strikes, Afghan forces have claimed growing success against the Taliban and other militant groups, including Islamic State, but militant attacks on civilian targets have continued, causing heavy casualties.\nThe attack in Jalalabad came just days after Taliban militants attacked the Hotel Intercontinental in the capital, Kabul, killing at least 20 people, including 13 foreigners.\nAdditional reporting by Eric Knecht in CAIRO; Writing by Robert Birsel; Editing by Nick Macfie\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-24T07:59:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-24T08:12:13.004+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
