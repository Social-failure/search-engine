Soccer Football - Serie A - Napoli vs Hellas Verona - Stadio San Paolo, Naples, Italy - January 6, 2018 Napoli's Kalidou Koulibaly scores their first goal REUTERS/Alessandro Garofalo \nTorino’s new coach Walter Mazzarri enjoyed a winning start with a 3-0 win over Bologna, who missed a penalty when the score was 1-1, and AC Milan scraped past Crotone 1-0 with the help of a goalkeeping mistake. \nMeanwhile, bottom club Benevento, who failed to win in their first 18 games, made it two in a row by beating Sampdoria 3-2. \nNapoli, aiming to stop Juventus’ run of six successive titles, lead with 51 points from 20 games while Juve are second with 47 ahead of their visit to Cagliari later on in the day. \nMaurizio Sarri’s side needed 65 minutes to break down stubborn Verona before Kalidou Koulibaly headed in from a corner and Jose Callejon volleyed home Lorenzo Insigne’s cross. \nImmobile took his tally to 20 in the league with his haul against SPAL, scoring a hat-trick between the 19th and 41st minutes and adding another five minutes into the second half. \nLuis Alberto got Lazio off the mark in the fifth minute, wriggling through the defence to score a brilliant individual goal, before Mirko Antenucci levelled with a penalty three minutes later. \nAntenucci also scored SPAL’s other goal in the 31st minute.
