We are committed to helping NCFBE patients, who presently have no available treatment options.”\nThe FDA has set a PDUFA action date of January 26, 2018 for the completion of its review of Linhaliq. The clinical program for Linhaliq was developed with guidance from the FDA, who also granted Orphan Drug (June 2011), Qualified Infections Disease Product (June 2014), and Fast Track (August 2014) designations to Linhaliq.\nThe Linhaliq application was based on data from three clinical studies. Two Phase 3 studies, ORBIT-3 and ORBIT-4, were identically designed, multinational, randomized (2:1), double-blind and placebo controlled trials. Both were conducted concurrently in similar geographies over 48 weeks, with an additional 4 weeks of open-label treatment and a 30-day safety follow up. Together with the Phase 2b ORBIT-2 study, these trials provide evidence of the clinical benefit of Linhaliq for patients with NCFBE who have chronic lung infections with P. aeruginosa .\nAbout Non-Cystic Fibrosis Bronchiectasis (NCFBE)\nNCFBE is a severe, chronic and rare disease characterized by abnormal dilatation of the bronchi and bronchioles, frequently associated with chronic lung infections. It is often a consequence of a vicious cycle of inflammation, recurrent lung infections, and bronchial wall damage. NCFBE represents an unmet medical need with high morbidity and mortality that affects more than 150,000 people in the U.S. and over 200,000 people in Europe. NCFBE patients who have chronic infections with Pseudomonas aeruginosa have a 6.5-fold increase in hospitalizations, three times higher mortality, and a worse quality of life compared with those without P. aeruginosa infections. There is currently no drug approved for the treatment of this condition.\nAbout Aradigm\nAradigm is an emerging specialty pharmaceutical company focused on the development and commercialization of drugs for the prevention and treatment of severe respiratory diseases.
