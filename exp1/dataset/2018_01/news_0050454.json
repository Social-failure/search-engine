I wanted to be 30 seconds ahead tonight,” said Ogier, who was only eighth in Saturday’s last stage. \n“It was very dirty out there, maybe my tyres were not the perfect choice. I was a bit on the limit.” \nOgier joined M-Sport last season after Volkswagen, with whom he won his first four titles, pulled out as part of a strategic shift to help the German carmaker overcome a costly emissions scandal. \nTanak also struggled with the dirt and mud in the 13th stage. \n“In the dirty places the tyres were good but in the dry they were overheating a bit,” he said. \n“It’s difficult to have the perfect tyre in this stage.”  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-27T18:55:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-27T19:12:31.035+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
