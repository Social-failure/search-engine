More than 300 people have been detained for social media posts criticizing the campaign and a prosecutor has issued detention warrants for 11 top doctors.\nOn Saturday, German magazine Der Spiegel, citing Naki’s lawyer, said the player wanted to terminate his contract with his Turkey-based team Amedspor due to security concerns and intended to stay in Germany.\nNaki, who was given an 18-month suspended sentence in April for “terrorist propaganda” in support of the outlawed Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK), said this month that he feared he had been attacked for his views after shots were fired at his car in Germany.\nAbout 40,000 people have been killed since the PKK took up arms against the Turkish state for autonomy in the country’s largely Kurdish southeast. The PKK is considered a terrorist organization by Turkey, the United States and the European Union.\nReporting by Ece Toksabay,; Writing by Tuvan Gumrukcu, editing by Ed Osmond\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-30T15:27:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-30T15:41:09.012+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
