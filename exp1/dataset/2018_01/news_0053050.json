On Thursday, the contract climbed to as high as $71.28, its highest since 2014.\nU.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures CLc1 closed at $66.14 a barrel, up 63 cents, or nearly 1 percent. On Thursday, they also reached their highest since December 2014, at $66.66.\nBrent posted a nearly 2.7 percent weekly gain, while WTI reached a weekly gain of 4.3 percent.\n“Technically, crude is a little overbought but it’s not causing a huge sell-off right now,” said Mike Sabo, senior market strategist at RJO Futures in Chicago.\nBoth contracts strengthened after support from a weakening dollar, which hit three-year lows against a basket of currencies .DXY.\nAs oil is priced in dollars, a weaker greenback can boost oil demand, making prices less expensive for buyers using other currencies.\n“The dip in the dollar raises our expectations for Brent to remain at $70 for a little while longer,” said Bill O‘Grady, chief market strategist at Confluence Investment Management in St. Louis, Missouri.\nOn the supply side, U.S. oil production C-OUT-T-EIA was expected to soon hit 10 million barrels per day (bpd), putting it on a par with top exporter Saudi Arabia.\nU.S. oil drillers added 12 rigs this week, the biggest weekly increase since March, General Electric Co’s ( GE.N ) Baker Hughes energy services firm said in its closely followed report on Friday.
