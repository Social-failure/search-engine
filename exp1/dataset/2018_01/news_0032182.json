The latter are not part of Moon’s main support base and tend to be more conservative in South Korea’s political landscape.\nMoon was elected to office in May last year with a high approval rating after his predecessor, Park Geun-hye, was removed from office over a corruption scandal.\nThe latest poll of 1,005 adults, was conducted this week from Tuesday to Thursday this week and has a margin of error of plus minus 3.1 percent.\nReporting by Heekyong Yang; Editing by Christine Kim and Michael Perry\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-19T05:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-19T05:13:21.019+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
