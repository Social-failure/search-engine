S&P also said there was a risk of greater policy uncertainty after this year's elections. \nThe decision underscored concerns that a business-friendly reform agenda proposed by the unpopular President Michel Temer may stall this year as a looming presidential race shortens the legislative calendar. \nBrazilian Finance Minister Henrique Meirelles had met with ratings agencies to try and stave off a downgrade after the government delayed to February a vote on pension reform that had initially been expected last year. \nThe move by S&P brings its long-term sovereign rating for Brazil three notches below investment grade. Brazil is rated Ba2 by Moody's Investors Service and BB by Fitch Ratings -- both two notches into \"junk\" territory. \nThe S&P downgrade \"is a negative development but it was expected, particularly after pension reform was delayed. It's not breaking news for markets,\" said Goldman Sachs economist Alberto Ramos in by telephone. \nA spokesman for Brazil's central bank declined to comment. The finance ministry did not immediately comment. \n\"This was already on the horizon as a possibility, given the process around the pension vote,\" said Wellington Moreira Franco, secretary-general for President Michel Temer's office. \"I think it's a warning of the economic and social consequences of not approving pension reform.\" (Reporting by Jake Spring and Lisandra Paraguassu; Additional reporting   Paulo and Kanika Sikka in Bengaluru; Editing by Brad Haynes and Sandra Maler)", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-12T01:01:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-12T08:15:35.003+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
