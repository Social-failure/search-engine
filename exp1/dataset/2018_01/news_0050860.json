We will appropriately weigh the balance between promotion of innovation and protection of users in (supervising) cryptocurrency exchanges,” he added. \nAso has previously expressed some caution over excessive regulation on cryptocurrencies. \nThe theft at Coincheck - one of the world’s biggest cyberheists - highlights the hazards of trade in an asset that policymakers are struggling to regulate, as well as the broader risks for Japan as it aims to leverage the financial technology or “fintech” industry to stimulate economic growth. \nMasatsugu Asakawa, Japan’s top financial diplomat, said on Monday that cryptocurrency regulation was likely to be on the agenda at the March meeting of G20 finance ministers and central bankers in Argentina. \nWorld leaders meeting in Davos last week issued renewed warnings of potential dangers from cryptocurrencies, with U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin highlighting Washington’s concerns over digital money being used for illicit purposes. \nThe FSA ordered improvements on Monday to operations at Coincheck, which on Friday suspended trading in all cryptocurrencies except bitcoin after hackers stole 58 billion yen ($532.40 million) of NEM coins, among the most popular digital currencies in the world. \n($1 = 108.9400 yen)", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-30T03:25:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-30T03:40:59.023+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
