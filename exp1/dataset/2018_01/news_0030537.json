Half-year sales rose by 1 percent compared to the directly corresponding period.\nData on Wednesday showed that South African retail sales jumped in November by their biggest margin in more than five years as sales in clothing, footwear and furniture rose, as the economy showed further signs of recovery.\nClothing retailer The Foschini Group and food retailer Shoprite Holdings on Tuesday reported higher nine months and six months to December sales, respectively.\nHowever, Woolworths warned on Monday that its half-year profit could drop by as much as 17.5 percent.
