Saleh’s General People’s Congress party accused the Houthis of trying to monopolize running the country. \nThe Houthis said Aqeeli and several of his aides were injured in the blast, describing Aqeeli’s injuries as serious. \nHadi appointed Aqeeli last September, replacing Major General Mohammed al-Maqdeshi, who was appointed as a presidential adviser. \nThe United Arab Emirates news agency WAM reported earlier this week that local Yemeni fighters in the southwest, backed by Emirati forces, killed dozens of armed Houthi group members and cut one of their main supply routes to the country’s third largest city of Taiz. \nThe Houthis, who have swept across Yemen since 2014 and overthrew Hadi’s internationally-recognized government in 2015, hold the capital Sanaa and much of northern Yemen, where most of the country’s 25 million people live. \nThe conflict - widely seen as a proxy war between regional rivals Saudi Arabia and Iran - has displaced more than 2 million people, caused a cholera epidemic and pushed the country to the brink of famine. At least 10,000 people have been killed.
