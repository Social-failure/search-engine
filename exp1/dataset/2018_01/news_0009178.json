We never come with a plan to throw out the CEO or to embarrass anyone,” Peltz said.\nThis is particularly noteworthy as CEOs at companies including Chipotle Mexican Grill Inc ( CMG.N ), Buffalo Wild Wings Inc ( BWLD.O ) and CSX Corp ( CSX.O ) exited in 2017 amid pressure from activist investors Bill Ackman, Mick McGuire and Paul Hilal.\nPeltz criticized how U.S. investors are required to elect boards, worrying about conflicts of interest at proxy advisory firms and how some big shareholders vote. “The proxy plumbing is busted,” he said.\nTurning to Trump, Peltz praised him for tax reform. “I‘m a results-oriented guy and I‘m happy with what he’s done. The markets have been great.”\nReporting by Svea Herbst-Bayliss and Rob Cox; Editing by Lisa Shumaker\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-10T05:04:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-10T05:17:48.013+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
