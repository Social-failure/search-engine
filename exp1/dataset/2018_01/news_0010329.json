Valy brings more than 20 years of experience in networking and chip architecture to Flex Logix. He will play a key role in helping the company develop innovative architectural solutions for networking applications and SoCs that enable its customers to utilize eFPGA to improve the flexibility and capability of their chip architectures.\n\"We are honored to have someone with Valy's experience and technical depth in ASICs, FPGAs and networking, which will be key to driving customer application and integration of eFPGAs into new architectures,\" said Tony Kozaczuk, director, solutions architecture. \"eFPGA enables networking chips and systems to support reconfigurable design blocks as well as reconfigurable architectures. This allows flexible implementation of protocols for packets, security, storage and machine learning throughout the data center, resulting in greater flexibility, performance and return-on-investment.\"\nValy attended Ben Gurion University in Israel for his BSc in EE and worked as a VLSI engineer/team leader at Galileo (now Marvell), Cisco and Siliquent (now Broadcom) in Israel before co-founding Tehuti Networks. Later, Valy joined Passave (acquired by PMC) working on fiber-to-the-home optical communications SoCs as a systems architect then as part of the CSTO Office of PMC when he relocated to Silicon Valley. Valy was also senior group director of FPGA prototyping platforms at Cadence where he managed the R&D and customer support teams.\nAbout Flex Logix\nFlex Logix, founded in March 2014, provides solutions for reconfigurable RTL in chip and system designs using embedded FPGA IP cores and software.
