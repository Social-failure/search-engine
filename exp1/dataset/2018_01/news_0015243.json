REUTERS/Neil Hall \nMid-cap retailer Card Factory ( CARDC.L ) slumped 20 percent, also on the back of its Christmas update. \n“Thursday’s batch of updates does not alleviate renewed investor concerns that the retail sector could relapse into the malaise of a few years back”, Ken Odeluga, a market analyst at City Index commented. \nBritish builder Barratt ( BDEV.L ) fell 2.7 percent, after it posted a flat sales rate in the last six months of 2017 while Taylor Wimpey ( TW.L ) edged down 1.8 percent, continuing a slide from the previous session, when it said full-year results for 2017 would be in line with expectations. \nLifting the broader index, stronger metal prices pushed up big mining companies, including Anglo American ( AAL.L ), Rio Tinto ( RIO.L ) and BHP Billiton ( BLT.L ). Their shares rose 3.6 percent, 1.9 percent and 1.8 percent respectively. \nAmong the gainers, Just Eat ( JE.L ) led with a rise of 4.7 percent, underpinned by a Barclays upgrade to “overweight” on expectations of strong revenue momentum in the fourth quarter and the year 2018. \nOil prices, surging to their highest since 2014, also helped BP ( BP.L ) and Royal Dutch Shell ( RDSa.L ) add a few points to the index with rises of 0.5 percent.
