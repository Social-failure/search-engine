Of course as Ireland we want that to be as close as possible - we would have it ‘Norway-plus’ but I think we have to get into the detail now of what that means,” Leo Varadkar told Bloomberg Television in an interview in Davos, Switzerland.\nNorway is part of the European Union’s single market, but not the customs union.\nThe EU’s chief Brexit negotiation Michel Barnier in December said the future free trade agreement between the European Union and Britain would have to be along the same lines as the one the EU has with Canada.\nBut Varadkar said that neither the Norwegian model nor the Canadian model would fit the United Kingdom.\n“It’s difficult to compare it to Norway, which is a relatively small country... or a country like Canada, which is on a different continent,” he said.\nWhile Britain has repeatedly said it will not remain in the EU customs union or single market, “perhaps we can negotiate something that isn’t very different to that,” Varadkar said.\nSuch a deal would, however, require the United Kingdom to realise that it cannot cherry pick benefits of EU membership without the corresponding responsibilities.\nAccess to European markets for London-based financial services firms would depend on what the UK might give in return, he said.\nReporting by Conor Humphries Editing by Jeremy Gaunt\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-01-25T17:48:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-26T21:12:49.009+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
