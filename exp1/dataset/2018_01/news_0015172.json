REUTERS/Peter Nicholls/File Photo “Ecuador is currently exploring other solutions in dialogue with the UK, like good offices of renowned authorities, other states, or international organizations that could facilitate a just, final and dignified solution for all parties,” Ecuador’s foreign minister Maria Fernanda Espinosa told a press conference.\n“There are well-founded fears we have about possible risks to his life and integrity, not necessarily by the UK but by third party states.”\nShe did not give details on how granting Assange citizenship might help in avoiding his arrest by British police.\nFor some, Assange is a cyber hero for exposing government abuses of power and championing free speech but to others he is a criminal who has undermined the security of the West by exposing secrets.\n“Ecuador knows that the way to resolve this issue is for Julian Assange to leave the embassy to face justice,” said a British Foreign Office spokesman.\nThe former computer hacker enraged Washington by publishing hundreds of thousands of secret U.S. diplomatic cables that laid bare often highly critical U.S. appraisals of world leaders from Russian President Vladimir Putin to the Saudi royal family.\nReporting by Mark Hosenball in London and Alexandra Valencia in Quito; Writing by Girish Gupta; Editing by Stephen Addison and Andrew Hay\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-11T15:46:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-11T16:00:28.001+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
