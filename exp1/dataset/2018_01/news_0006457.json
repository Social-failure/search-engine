The leu had already reached a 2-month high against the euro in the previous session. Trading at 4.636 at 0826 GMT, it was off that high, but still slightly firmer from Friday. A hike in the 1.75 percent benchmark interest rate would make the NBR the second central bank in the European Union's eastern nations to start to lift rates from record low levels, after two hikes by the Czech central bank (CNB) since August. While the CNB has the lowest inflation target in the region at 2 percent, markets have been gripped by overheating concerns in Romania where a surge in wages has helped the economy to grow by a stellar annual 8.8 percent in the third quarter of last year. Between August and November, Romania's annual inflation rate surged two percentage points to 3.2 percent. In a Reuters poll, five analysts expected the bank to hold fire, while four projected a quarter point hike. \"There are concerns that inflation may rise above 5 percent by the summer and everybody is looking at the central bank, what they will do,\" one fixed income trader said. \"This caused the recent swings in bond yields there... and worries could boost yields if the central bank does not deliver a hike,\" the trader added. Romanian 2027-expiry bonds traded at a yield of 4.3 percent, flat from Friday. Elsewhere in the region, the zloty eased 0.2 percent to 4.159, but remained near Friday's six-and-a-half year highs of 4.143. The region's currencies generally started the year strengthening, lifted by a rise in risk appetite in global markets and the prospect of healthy economic growth in Central Europe. The Polish central bank is unlikely to encourage expectations for interest rate hikes at its meeting on Wednesday. \"The zloty will probably not be helped by comments after the MPC (central bank) meeting,\" ING analysts said in a note, adding that correction could weaken the zloty to 4.2 in the next couple of weeks, even though a big easing is unlikely. The forint also eased slightly. New Hungarian data showed that industrial output grew 3.4 percent in annual terms in November, half of analysts' forecast, but retail sales grew at a robust 6.4 percent rate. Czech output growth, at 8.5 percent, exceeded expectations, similar to a 11.7 billion crown trade surplus in November. The crown firmed 0.1 percent.
