FILE PHOTO - Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov arrives for the meeting with officials of Rostec high-technology state corporation at the Novo-Ogaryovo state residence outside Moscow, Russia December 7, 2017. REUTERS/Sergei Karpukhin \nMoscow was responding to comments made by U.S. National Security Adviser H.R. McMaster in a Dec. 15 video clip in which he said there were “initial signs” that Russia was interfering in the Mexican poll. \nMcMaster did not elaborate on how Russia was seeking to influence the July ballot when Mexico is due to elect a new president to succeed Enrique Pena Nieto. \nSome analysts see frontrunner Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, the leftist former mayor of Mexico City, as the Kremlin’s favourite given positive coverage he has received from Kremlin-backed media outlets like Sputnik and RT. \nBut Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov, who has repeatedly denied accusations by U.S. intelligence officials and others that Moscow interferes in any foreign elections, told Reuters on Thursday allegations of Russian meddling in Mexico were wide of the mark. \n“This is incorrect, and importantly, unfounded,” Peskov said of McMaster’s allegations.
