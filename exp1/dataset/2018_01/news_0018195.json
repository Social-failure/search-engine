Brazilian policymakers have so far stopped short of introducing regulation. \nThe value of bitcoin, the world’s No. 1 cryptocurrency, plummeted on Thursday after South Korea’s government said it planned to ban virtual currency trading, although it has since trimmed some of those losses. \nThe cost of bitcoin in U.S. dollars soared 1,500 percent last year, sparking concerns of a potential bubble.
