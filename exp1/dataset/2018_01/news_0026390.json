There will also be a letter of credit, although the exact size of that is still to be determined. \nTDR Capital-owned EG Group, formerly known as Euro Garages, acquired UK roadside restaurant Little Chef in February, including 78 roadsite sites, from the Kout Food Group. \nIt was last in the loan market in April 2017 when it repriced its £620m and €914m term loans, at 500bp over Libor and 400bp over Euribor, respectively. Both loans were offered with a 0% floor and an OID of 99.875, according to Thomson Reuters LPC data. \nPrior to that the company tapped the loan market in October 2016 for an €876m-equivalent loan, backing its merger with European Forecourt Retail. \nTDR acquired a £1.3bn minority stake in Euro Garages in January 2016, backed by a £745m financing split between a £370m seven-year TLB. \nTDR was not immediately available to comment.
