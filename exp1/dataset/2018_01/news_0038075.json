Well, the BOJ tried to push back against it, but it really didn't stick,\" said Win Thin, the Global Head of Emerging Markets Strategy at Brown Brothers Harriman.\n\"We are still stuck with this sell-the dollar-buy-the-yen trend right now,\" he said.\nThe British pound pushed above the $1.40 mark, extending a rally in which growing optimism about the UK economy and protracted dollar weakness have trumped worries about the terms of Britain's exit from the European Union.\nLatin American currencies weakened on concerns over potential U.S. protectionism.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-23T04:15:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-23T06:03:13.142+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
