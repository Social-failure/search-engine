Both could happen simultaneously, he told CNBC. \nSenate Republicans would need to use budget reconciliation rules, which require only a simple majority vote, to pass welfare reform. The Senate GOP majority just went to 51 seats from 52 seats, and they would need to get to 60 votes to overcome a likely Democratic filibuster and make possible changes to social safety net programs. Congress could next use budget reconciliation for the fiscal year 2019 budget, likely later this year.\nHere are the officials joining Trump: \nVice President Mike Pence Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky.
