However, Bannon mentioned that he discussed with fellow White House staffers the infamous June 2016 Trump Tower meeting that included Donald Trump Jr., former Trump campaign boss Paul Manafort, Trump son-in-law and top aide Jared Kushner and alleged Russian operatives. Committee members then aggressively pushed Bannon to answer more questions about his time inside the White House, according to accounts of the hearing. \nCNBC has reached out to the White House for comment.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-18T21:10:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-18T21:14:12.068+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
