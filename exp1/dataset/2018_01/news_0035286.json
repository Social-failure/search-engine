I think there are a lot of cultural synergies between Embraer and Boeing,” Slattery said. \n“Boeing is deeply respected within Brazil and within Embraer and now we have to respect the requirements of our government,” he said. \n“Conversations are ongoing and I can’t make any more commentary,” he added.
