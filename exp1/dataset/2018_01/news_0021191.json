Solid exports have been a boon for Chinese policymakers.\nMeanwhile, China’s bank lending halved in December as the government kept up its campaign to curb financial system risks, but banks still managed to dole out a record amount for the year amid the tighter scrutiny.\nPolicy sources told Reuters previously that China will still keep its GDP growth target at around 6.5 percent in 2018 as Beijing seeks to balance efforts to reduce debt risks while keeping the economy on a steady footing.\nThe central bank is likely to keep its grip on money supply this year to help contain risks, but no increases in benchmark interest rates are expected any time soon following a recent rise in corporate funding costs, according to the sources.\nSLIGHTLY WEAKER DECEMBER DATA EXPECTED Additionally, analysts will be looking at December data on factory output, investment and retail sales, also released on Thursday, for clues on economic momentum heading into early 2018.\nEconomists expected December factory output to have grown 6 percent from a year earlier, slowing from November’s 6.1 percent.\nChina’s commodities buying spree eased slightly in December, with copper, iron ore and crude oil imports all falling from bumper levels a month earlier, the latest sign that Beijing’s anti-smog crackdown is slowing industrial activity.\nRetail sales are seen growing 10.1 percent in December from a year earlier, easing slightly from 10.2 percent in November.\nFixed-asset investment is predicted to have increased 7.1percent in 2017, easing from 7.2 percent in January-November.\nReporting by Kevin Yao in BEIJING and Shaloo Shrivastava in BENGALURU; Editing by Sam Holmes\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-01-15T17:23:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-15T16:48:23.049+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
