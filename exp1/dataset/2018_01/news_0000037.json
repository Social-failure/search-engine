It was unearthed near the plaza of Judaism’s Western Wall in the Old City of Jerusalem.\n“It supports the Biblical rendering of the existence of a governor of the city in Jerusalem 2,700 years ago,” an Antiquities Authority statement Quote: d excavator Shlomit Weksler-Bdolah as saying.\nGovernors of Jerusalem, appointed by the king, are mentioned twice in the Bible, in 2 Kings, which refers to Joshua holding the position, and in 2 Chronicles, which mentions Masseiah in the post during the reign of Josiah.\nThe Antiquities Authority’s announcement came several weeks after U.S. President Donald Trump recognized Jerusalem as Israel’s capital, a decision that overturned a decades-old policy on the status of the city and stirred Palestinian protests and international concern.\nWriting by Jeffrey Heller; Editing by Adrian Croft\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-01T13:10:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-01T13:43:31.010+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
