Korea's government unveiled multiple options for cryptocurrency exchange regulation on Dec. 28, including allowing venues to operate under tighter supervision.\nBitcoin dropped as much as 12% to $12,801, before paring its loss to about 6.5% at 9:51 a.m. London time, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Ripple fell 11% and ethereum slumped 3%.\nGovernments around the world are increasing scrutiny of cryptocurrencies as soaring prices attract everyone from mom-and-pop investors to Wall Street banks.

The country's prime minister has said that cryptocurrencies might corrupt the nation's youth, while the government warned in December that it would be conducting on-site investigations of exchanges. The finance ministry is studying a cryptocurrency tax.\n\"For the last few months the Korean government has been making it very clear they want to bring this speculative activity under control,\" said Thomas Glucksmann, Hong Kong-based head of APAC business development with cryptocurrency exchange Gatecoin Ltd. \"This isn't really too much of a surprise.\"\nOne of Korea's biggest digital currency venues, Bithumb, said on Thursday that it met briefly with tax officials this week.

An unidentified spokesman told the Financial Times : \"They asked for some data such as cryptocurrency trading volume, our exchange's sales and whether we are paying corporate tax well.\"\nPolice have been investigating Coinone's margin-trading service since last year, according to an official who asked not to be named citing policy. He added that no other large exchanges are under police investigation.\nEven if Korean lawmakers push forward with an exchange ban, local investors are likely to find ways to keep buying cryptocurrencies, said Mike Kayamori, head of Tokyo-based exchange Quoine, which counts Koreans among its customers.\n\"There are always underground exchanges\" and over-the-counter platforms, he said. \"They'll probably convert their money into bitcoin there, and then start trading offshore.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-11T08:24:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-11T14:01:36.017+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
