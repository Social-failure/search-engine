Weather service Meteo France kept the French Atlantic coast areas south of Brittany on orange alert, but downgraded the threat level in most other areas of western France.\nWinds with speeds of up to 140 kilometres per hour battered the countryâ€™s Atlantic coast in mid-afternoon but no serious damage was reported.\nMajor power cuts or blackouts are rare in France, which produces three quarters of its power with nuclear energy.\nIn July 2015, some 830,000 households temporarily lost power in western France after exceptionally warm weather damaged transformers.\nReporting by Geert De Clercq; editing by Jason Neely\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-01T14:25:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-01T15:01:56.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
