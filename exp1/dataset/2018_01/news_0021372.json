The money for those payments was included in the nearly $130 million in legislative funding Dayton vetoed from the fiscal 2018-19 budget in May in an effort to pressure lawmakers to revise tax measures that he said will harm the state’s financial stability.\nFollowing a Minnesota Supreme Court decision upholding the veto’s constitutionality, lawmakers were expected to take up an appropriation when they return to session next month.\nFitch said in December that a failure to resolve the funding impasse “would suggest a level of political dysfunction that is inconsistent” with Minnesota’s AAA rating.\nReporting by Karen Pierog; Editing by Matthew Lewis\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-01-17T04:07:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-16T23:05:13.023+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
