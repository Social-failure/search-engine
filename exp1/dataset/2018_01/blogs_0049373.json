It is deplorable for anyone to find themselves in this situation.\" \nWynn blamed his ex-wife Elaine for stirring up trouble. The couple is currently in the middle of a lawsuit. But Ralston said the Journal more likely began an investigation because of the current political environment and things like the #MeToo movement, Ralston said. \n\"The divorce certainly is nasty,\" Ralston said. \"There certainly is no love lost between the two of them. But here is what I do know. In this new atmosphere of sexual harassment being a big deal in the political, social consciousness of this country, the Wall Street Journal started working on pieces just as we have and many other news organizations have. There have always been rumors about sexual harassment in the context of the casino business. My guess is they started working on this story based on that. Not based on being fed information by Elaine Wynn.\" \nThe Journal did not respond to a request for comment. In its story, the Journal said it contacted more than 150 past and present employees and found dozens that told stories of sexual misconduct. Many people who spoke said they were worried talking to the media would hurt future job prospects because Wynn is so well-connected in Las Vegas. \n\"Some of these kinds of rumors or allegations have been out there before,\" Ralston said, referencing the Nevada Independent columnist John L. Smith who wrote a book that alluded to \"some of this stuff.\" \n\"It's going to be very, very difficult for him to get away from that [Wall Street Journal article] even though he has said he never assaulted a woman,\" Ralston said.
