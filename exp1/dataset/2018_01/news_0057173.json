Britain's Prime Minister Theresa May walks out of 10 Downing Street to greet the Prime Minister of Estonia, Juri Ratas in London, January 30, 2018. REUTERS/Toby Melville \nShe said lawmakers would be given analysis on the actual deal that Britain reaches with the European Union ahead of a vote which will allow lawmakers to accept or reject the negotiated settlement. \n“When the time comes for parliament to vote on the final deal, we will ensure that parliament has the appropriate analysis on which to be fully informed, on which to base their judgement,” May told reporters travelling to China for a trade visit. \nThe parliamentary vote is a potential flashpoint in the Brexit process. No date is yet scheduled, but it will take place after the final divorce terms have been agreed. \nMay said it would be wrong to publish any official analysis until the terms of the deal are known, in part because doing so could prejudice the negotiations.
