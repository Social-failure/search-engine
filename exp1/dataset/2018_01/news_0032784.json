Net income for the quarter ended December 31, 2017 was $7 thousand or $0.00 per share – diluted, compared with net income of $2.3 million or $0.17 per share – diluted for the same period of 2016. Net income for the year ended December 31, 2017 was $7.3 million or $0.48 per share – diluted compared with $5.3 million or $0.39 per share – diluted for the year ended December 31, 2016.\nSignificant Item – Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017\nThe 2017 results include the $2.5 million negative net impact of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017(“Act”) for both the fourth quarter ($0.15 per share – diluted) and for the year ($0.16 per share – diluted). The Act reduced the federal corporate tax rate from 35% to 21% and required the Company to revalue its deferred tax assets and liabilities. Management believes that our financial results are more comparative excluding the impact of these deferred tax asset and liability revaluations.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nIn addition to results presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America (GAAP), this press release contains certain non-GAAP financial measures. We believe that these non-GAAP financial measures provide investors with information useful in understanding the Company’s financial performance; however, readers of this document are urged to review these non-GAAP financial measures in conjunction with the GAAP results as reported.\nSELECTED NON-GAAP FINANCIAL INFORMATION - UNAUDITED (amounts in thousands except per share data) For The Three Months Ended For The Twelve Months Ended Reconciliation of Net Income (GAAP) to Net Income Excluding December 31, September 30, December 31, Deferred Tax Asset Write-down (non-GAAP): 2017 2016 2017 2017\n2016 Net income (GAAP) $ 7 $ 2,297 $ 2,876 $ 7,344 $ 5,259 Deferred tax asset write-down (GAAP) 2,490 — — 2,490 363 Net income excluding deferred tax asset write-down (non-GAAP) $ 2,497 $ 2,297 $ 2,876 $ 9,834 $ 5,622 Earnings per share - diluted (GAAP) $ — $ 0.17 $ 0.18 $ 0.48 $ 0.39 Effect of deferred tax asset write-down 0.15 — — 0.16 0.03 Earnings per share - diluted excluding net deferred tax asset write-down $ 0.15 $ 0.17 $ 0.18 $ 0.64 $ 0.42 Non-GAAP Ratios: Return on average assets excluding net deferred tax asset write-down 0.79 % 0.81 % 0.93 % 0.82 % 0.52 % Return on average equity excluding net deferred tax asset write-down 7.69 % 9.69 % 9.01 % 8.48 % 6.07 % Effective tax rate excluding deferred tax asset write-down 34.46 % 19.94 % 33.16 % 31.10 % 22.10 % GAAP Information: Return on average assets 0.00 % 0.81 % 0.93 % 0.61 % 0.49 % Return on average equity 0.02 % 9.69 % 9.01 % 6.34 % 5.68 % Effective tax rate 99.82 % 19.94 % 33.16 % 48.54 % 27.13 % Randall S.
