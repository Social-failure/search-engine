There's one pocket in the sector that may give investors broad gains, he said.\n\"The stocks in the industry that I like most in the technology sector is semiconductors because particularly some of the memory based companies have come down in my view way too much,\" Meeks said. \" Micron is very interesting here on a semiconductor capital equipment side.\"\nVote Vote to see results Total Votes: Not a Scientific Survey.
