(NASDAQ: CFFN) (the \"Company\") announced results today for the quarter ended December 31, 2017. Detailed results will be available in the Company's Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended December 31, 2017, which will be filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (\"SEC\") on or about February 8, 2018 and posted on our website, http://ir.capfed.com . For best viewing results, please view this release in Portable Document Format (PDF) on our website.\nHighlights for the quarter include:\ndividends paid of $50.4 million, or $0.375 per share; net income of $31.8 million, including a $7.5 million income tax benefit related to the revaluation of net deferred tax liabilities resulting from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the \"Tax Act\") enacted in December 2017; basic and diluted earnings per share of $0.24; and net interest margin of 1.83% (2.20% excluding the effects of the leverage strategy).\nComparison of Operating Results for the Three Months Ended December 31, 2017 and September 30, 2017\nFor the quarter ended December 31, 2017, the Company recognized net income of $31.8 million, or $0.24 per share, compared to net income of $20.6 million, or $0.15 per share, for the quarter ended September 30, 2017. The increase in net income was due primarily to a decrease in income tax expense resulting from the enactment of the Tax Act on December 22, 2017, the impact of which was an increase in basic and diluted earnings per share of $0.08 for the current quarter.\nThe Tax Act made significant changes to the U.S. corporate income tax laws, such as a permanent reduction in the federal corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21% effective January 1, 2018, and changes to and/or limitations on certain income tax deductions. The Company has a fiscal year end of September 30th, so the change in the income tax rate will result in the use of a blended federal income tax rate for fiscal year 2018. In accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (\"GAAP\"), the Company applied the blended federal income tax rate to pretax income in the current quarter and revalued its deferred tax assets and liabilities as of December 22, 2017 to account for the future impact of a lower income tax rate. The revaluation of the Company's deferred tax assets and liabilities contributed $7.5 million to the decrease in income tax expense in the current quarter. The benefit of the lower income tax rate is partially offset by the Company recognizing more proportional amortization expense related to its low income housing partnerships in fiscal year 2018 resulting from an adjustment to account for a higher portion of those benefits realized prior to the income tax rate change. Management estimates the effective income tax rate for fiscal year 2018 to be between 20% and 21% and approximately 22% for fiscal year 2019.\nNet interest income decreased $284 thousand, or 0.6%, from the prior quarter to $49.4 million for the current quarter. The net interest margin decreased one basis point from 1.84% for the prior quarter to 1.83% for the current quarter. Excluding the effects of the leverage strategy, the net interest margin would have decreased one basis point from 2.21% for the prior quarter to 2.20% for the current quarter.\nInterest and Dividend Income\nThe weighted average yield on total interest-earning assets for the current quarter was 2.98%, unchanged from the prior quarter, while the average balance of interest-earning assets decreased $26.0 million between the two periods. Absent the impact of the leverage strategy, the weighted average yield on total interest-earning assets would have decreased one basis point from the prior quarter, to 3.31%. The following table presents the components of interest and dividend income for the time periods presented, along with the change measured in dollars and percent.\nFor the Three Months Ended\nDecember 31,\nSeptember 30,\nChange Expressed in:\n2017\n2017\nDollars\nPercent\n(Dollars in thousands)\nINTEREST AND DIVIDEND INCOME:\nLoans receivable\n$\n64,189\n$\n64,329\n$\n(140)\n(0.2)%\nCash and cash equivalents\n7,114\n6,669\n445\n6.7\nMortgage-backed securities (\"MBS\")\n5,252\n5,435\n(183)\n(3.4)\nFederal Home Loan Bank Topeka (\"FHLB\") stock\n3,095\n3,080\n15\n0.5\nInvestment securities\n994\n1,061\n(67)\n(6.3)\nTotal interest and dividend income\n$\n80,644\n$\n80,574\n$\n70\n0.1\nThe increase in interest income on cash and cash equivalents was due primarily to a $70.4 million increase in the average balance, as well as a four basis point increase in the weighted average yield, to 1.29% for the current quarter, resulting from an increase in the yield earned on balances held at the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City (the \"FRB of Kansas City\").\nInterest Expense\nThe weighted average rate paid on total interest-bearing liabilities for the current quarter increased two basis points from the prior quarter, to 1.29%, while the average balance of interest-bearing liabilities decreased $38.0 million between the two periods. Absent the impact of the leverage strategy, the weighted average rate paid on total interest-bearing liabilities for the current quarter would have increased one basis point from the prior quarter, to 1.29%. The following table presents the components of interest expense for the time periods presented, along with the change measured in dollars and percent.\nFor the Three Months Ended\nDecember 31,\nSeptember 30,\nChange Expressed in:\n2017\n2017\nDollars\nPercent\n(Dollars in thousands)\nINTEREST EXPENSE:\nFHLB borrowings\n$\n17,917\n$\n18,099\n$\n(182)\n(1.0)%\nDeposits\n11,961\n11,313\n648\n5.7\nRepurchase agreements\n1,392\n1,504\n(112)\n(7.4)\nTotal interest expense\n$\n31,270\n$\n30,916\n$\n354\n1.1\nThe table above includes interest expense on FHLB borrowings both associated and not associated with the leverage strategy. Interest expense on FHLB borrowings not related to the leverage strategy decreased $451 thousand from the prior quarter due mainly to a four basis point decrease in the weighted average rate paid on the portfolio, to 2.08% for the current quarter, along with a $35.5 million decrease in the average balance of the portfolio. Interest expense on FHLB borrowings associated with the leverage strategy increased $268 thousand from the prior quarter due to a five basis point increase in the weighted average rate paid as a result of an increase in interest rates between periods.\nThe increase in interest expense on deposits was due primarily to a five basis point increase in the weighted average rate, to 0.91% for the current quarter. The increase in the weighted average rate was primarily related to the certificate of deposit portfolio, which increased seven basis points to 1.51% for the current quarter.\nThe decrease in interest expense on repurchase agreements was due to the maturity of a $100.0 million repurchase agreement during the quarter.\nProvision for Credit Losses\nCapitol Federal Savings Bank (the \"Bank\") did not record a provision for credit losses during the current quarter or the prior quarter. Based on management's assessment of the allowance for credit losses (\"ACL\") formula analysis model and several other factors, it was determined that no provision for credit losses was necessary. Net loan charge-offs were $28 thousand during the current quarter compared to $88 thousand in the prior quarter. At December 31, 2017, loans 30 to 89 days delinquent were 0.25% of total loans and loans 90 or more days delinquent or in foreclosure were 0.15% of total loans.\nNon-Interest Income\nThe following table presents the components of non-interest income for the time periods presented, along with the change measured in dollars and percent.\nFor the Three Months Ended\nDecember 31,\nSeptember 30,\nChange Expressed in:\n2017\n2017\nDollars\nPercent\n(Dollars in thousands)\nNON-INTEREST INCOME:\nRetail fees and charges\n$\n3,965\n$\n3,930\n$\n35\n0.9%\nIncome from bank-owned life insurance (\"BOLI\")\n534\n564\n(30)\n(5.3)\nOther non-interest income\n859\n1,401\n(542)\n(38.7)\nTotal non-interest income\n$\n5,358\n$\n5,895\n$\n(537)\n(9.1)\nThe decrease in other non-interest income was due primarily to a loss on the sale of loans during the current quarter compared to a gain on the sale of loans during the prior quarter as management continues to test loan sale processes for liquidity purposes, along with a decrease in insurance commissions resulting from the receipt of annual commissions from certain insurance providers during the prior quarter and no such commissions received during the current quarter.\nNon-Interest Expense\nThe following table presents the components of non-interest expense for the time periods presented, along with the change measured in dollars and percent.\nFor the Three Months Ended\nDecember 31,\nSeptember 30,\nChange Expressed in:\n2017\n2017\nDollars\nPercent\n(Dollars in thousands)\nNON-INTEREST EXPENSE:\nSalaries and employee benefits\n$\n10,528\n$\n11,049\n$\n(521)\n(4.7)%\nInformation technology and related expense\n3,331\n2,758\n573\n20.8\nOccupancy, net\n2,765\n2,716\n49\n1.8\nDeposit and loan transaction costs\n1,407\n1,366\n41\n3.0\nRegulatory and outside services\n1,140\n1,827\n(687)\n(37.6)\nFederal insurance premium\n852\n888\n(36)\n(4.1)\nAdvertising and promotional\n685\n1,398\n(713)\n(51.0)\nOffice supplies and related expense\n442\n511\n(69)\n(13.5)\nOther non-interest expense\n886\n966\n(80)\n(8.3)\nTotal non-interest expense\n$\n22,036\n$\n23,479\n$\n(1,443)\n(6.1)\nThe decrease in salaries and employee benefits expense was due primarily to the prior quarter including compensation expense on unallocated Employee Stock Ownership Plan (\"ESOP\") shares related to the True Blue Capitol dividend paid during the prior fiscal year. The increase in information technology and related expense and the decrease in regulatory and outside services were due mainly to a change in the presentation of certain information technology professional and consulting expenses beginning in fiscal year 2018. Information technology professional and consulting expenses are now being reported in information technology and related expenses rather than regulatory and outside services. The decrease in advertising and promotional expense was due primarily to the timing of media campaigns and sponsorships.\nThe Company's efficiency ratio was 40.26% for the current quarter compared to 42.26% for the prior quarter. The change in the efficiency ratio was due primarily to lower non-interest expense in the current quarter compared to the prior quarter. The efficiency ratio is a measure of a financial institution's total non-interest expense as a percentage of the sum of net interest income (pre-provision for credit losses) and non-interest income. A lower value indicates that the financial institution is generating revenue with a proportionally lower level of expense.\nIncome Tax Expense\nIncome tax expense was $860 thousand for the current quarter, compared to $11.5 million for the prior quarter. The effective tax rate was 2.6% for the current quarter compared to 35.8% for the prior quarter. The lower effective income tax rate and income tax expense were due primarily to revaluing the Company's deferred tax assets and liabilities, as well as applying a lower corporate income tax rate to the Company's current quarter pretax income. Management estimates the effective income tax rate for fiscal year 2018 to be between 20% and 21% and approximately 22% for fiscal year 2019.\nComparison of Operating Results for the Three Months Ended December 31, 2017 and 2016\nThe Company recognized net income of $31.8 million, or $0.24 per share, for the current quarter compared to net income of $20.6 million, or $0.15 per share, for the quarter ended December 31, 2016. The increase in net income was due primarily to a decrease in income tax expense resulting from the Tax Act being signed into law during the quarter.\nThe net interest margin increased 10 basis points, from 1.73% for the prior year quarter to 1.83% for the current quarter. Excluding the effects of the leverage strategy, the net interest margin would have increased 13 basis points, from 2.07% for the prior year quarter to 2.20% for the current quarter. The increase in the net interest margin was due mainly to an increase in interest-earning asset yields, as well as a shift in the mix of interest-earning assets from relatively lower yielding securities to higher yielding loans and a net decrease in the cost of liabilities not related to the leverage strategy.\nInterest and Dividend Income\nThe weighted average yield on total interest-earning assets increased 22 basis points, from 2.76% for the prior year quarter to 2.98% for the current quarter, while the average balance of interest-earning assets decreased $141.3 million from the prior year quarter. Absent the impact of the leverage strategy, the weighted average yield on total interest-earning assets would have increased 11 basis points, from 3.20% for the prior year quarter to 3.31% for the current quarter. The following table presents the components of interest and dividend income for the time periods presented along with the change measured in dollars and percent.\nFor the Three Months Ended\nDecember 31,\nChange Expressed in:\n2017\n2016\nDollars\nPercent\n(Dollars in thousands)\nINTEREST AND DIVIDEND INCOME:\nLoans receivable\n$\n64,189\n$\n61,945\n$\n2,244\n3.6%\nCash and cash equivalents\n7,114\n2,969\n4,145\n139.6\nMBS\n5,252\n6,362\n(1,110)\n(17.4)\nFHLB stock\n3,095\n2,939\n156\n5.3\nInvestment securities\n994\n1,107\n(113)\n(10.2)\nTotal interest and dividend income\n$\n80,644\n$\n75,322\n$\n5,322\n7.1\nThe increase in interest income on loans receivable was due mainly to a $180.8 million increase in the average balance of the portfolio, as well as a three basis point increase in the weighted average yield on the portfolio to 3.56% for the current quarter. Loan growth was funded through cash flows from the securities portfolio. The increase in the weighted average yield was due primarily to a decrease in the amortization of premiums related to correspondent loans.\nThe increase in interest income on cash and cash equivalents was due to a 75 basis point increase in the weighted average yield resulting from an increase in the yield earned on balances held at the FRB of Kansas City.\nThe decrease in interest income on the MBS portfolio was due to a $267.6 million decrease in the average balance of the portfolio, partially offset by a 13 basis point increase in the weighted average yield on the portfolio to 2.25% for the current quarter. Cash flows not reinvested were used primarily to fund loan growth and pay off certain maturing FHLB borrowings. The increase in the weighted average yield was due primarily to adjustable-rate MBS repricing to higher market rates, as well as a decrease in the impact of net premium amortization. Net premium amortization of $854 thousand during the current quarter decreased the weighted average yield on the portfolio by 37 basis points. During the prior year quarter, $1.3 million of net premiums were amortized, which decreased the weighted average yield on the portfolio by 43 basis points. As of December 31, 2017, the remaining net balance of premiums on our portfolio of MBS was $8.8 million.\nInterest Expense\nThe weighted average rate paid on total interest-bearing liabilities increased 14 basis points, from 1.15% for the prior year quarter to 1.29% for the current quarter, while the average balance of interest-bearing liabilities decreased $110.5 million from the prior year quarter. Absent the impact of the leverage strategy, the weighted average rate paid on total interest-bearing liabilities would have decreased one basis point, from 1.30% for the prior year quarter to 1.29% for the current quarter. The following table presents the components of interest expense for the time periods presented, along with the change measured in dollars and percent.\nFor the Three Months Ended\nDecember 31,\nChange Expressed in:\n2017\n2016\nDollars\nPercent\n(Dollars in thousands)\nINTEREST EXPENSE:\nFHLB borrowings\n$\n17,917\n$\n16,117\n$\n1,800\n11.2%\nDeposits\n11,961\n10,396\n1,565\n15.1\nRepurchase agreements\n1,392\n1,503\n(111)\n(7.4)\nTotal interest expense\n$\n31,270\n$\n28,016\n$\n3,254\n11.6\nThe table above includes interest expense on FHLB borrowings both associated and not associated with the leverage strategy. Interest expense on FHLB borrowings not related to the leverage strategy decreased $2.0 million from the prior year quarter due to a $182.3 million decrease in the average balance of the portfolio and a 19 basis point decrease in the weighted average rate paid on the portfolio, to 2.08% for the current quarter. The decrease in the average balance was a result of using cash flows from the securities portfolio and funds generated from deposit growth to pay off certain advances that matured between periods. The decrease in the weighted average rate paid was due to certain advances maturing between periods being replaced at lower effective rates. Interest expense on FHLB borrowings associated with the leverage strategy increased $3.8 million from the prior year quarter due to a 75 basis point increase in the weighted average rate paid as a result of an increase in interest rates between periods.\nThe increase in interest expense on deposits was due primarily to an 11 basis point increase in the weighted average rate, to 0.91% for the current quarter. The increase in the weighted average rate was primarily related to the certificate of deposit portfolio, which increased 18 basis points to 1.51% for the current quarter. The weighted average rate paid on wholesale certificates increased 62 basis points, to 1.33% for the current quarter.\nNon-Interest Income\nThe following table presents the components of non-interest income for the time periods presented, along with the change measured in dollars and percent.\nFor the Three Months Ended\nDecember 31,\nChange Expressed in:\n2017\n2016\nDollars\nPercent\n(Dollars in thousands)\nNON-INTEREST INCOME:\nRetail fees and charges\n$\n3,965\n$\n3,709\n$\n256\n6.9%\nIncome from BOLI\n534\n523\n11\n2.1\nOther non-interest income\n859\n1,036\n(177)\n(17.1)\nTotal non-interest income\n$\n5,358\n$\n5,268\n$\n90\n1.7\nThe increase in retail fees and charges was due mainly to increases in debit card income and service charges earned.

The increase in other non-interest expense was due mainly to an increase in other real estate owned (\"OREO\") operations expense.\nThe Company's efficiency ratio was 40.26% for the current quarter compared to 41.08% for the prior year quarter. The improvement in the efficiency ratio was due primarily to higher net interest income in the current quarter compared to the prior year quarter.\nIncome Tax Expense\nIncome tax expense was $860 thousand for the current quarter compared to $10.4 million for the prior year quarter. The effective tax rate was 2.6% for the current quarter compared to 33.6% for the prior year quarter. The decrease in effective tax rate was due mainly to the Tax Act being signed into law during the current quarter.\nFinancial Condition as of December 31, 2017\nTotal assets were $8.99 billion at December 31, 2017 compared to $9.19 billion at September 30, 2017. The $202.8 million decrease was due primarily to a $322.5 million decrease in cash and cash equivalents, partially offset by an increase in FHLB stock. At December 31, 2017, the Bank was not required by the FHLB to redeem the FHLB stock associated with the leverage strategy. At previous quarter ends, this stock was redeemed.\nThe loans receivable portfolio, net, decreased $5.3 million to $7.19 billion at December 31, 2017, from $7.20 billion at September 30, 2017. During the current quarter, the Bank originated and refinanced $146.6 million of loans with a weighted average rate of 3.84% and purchased $99.8 million of one- to four-family loans from correspondent lenders with a weighted average rate of 3.59%. The Bank also entered into participations of $50.4 million of commercial real estate loans with a weighted average rate of 4.19%, of which $45.2 million had not yet been funded as of December 31, 2017. During the current quarter, the Bank funded $24.8 million of new and existing commercial real estate loans.\nThe Bank is continuing to manage the size of its loan portfolio as it manages its liquidity levels. Loan volume has primarily been maintained through the rates offered to correspondent lenders. Generally, over the past couple years, cash flows from the securities portfolio have been used primarily to purchase loans and in part to pay down FHLB advances. By moving cash from lower yielding assets to higher yielding assets and repaying higher cost liabilities, we have been able to maintain our net interest margin. In addition to the repayment of securities, the Bank has emphasized growth in the deposit portfolio in part to pay down FHLB advances. The ratio of securities and cash to total assets was approximately 15% at December 31, 2017, which is approximately where management would like to maintain that percentage. In the long run, management considers a 10% ratio of stockholders' equity to total assets at the Bank an appropriate level of capital. At December 31, 2017, this ratio was 13.5%.\nThe Bank has continued to utilize a leverage strategy to increase earnings in fiscal year 2018. The leverage strategy during the current quarter involved borrowing up to $2.10 billion either on the Bank's FHLB line of credit or by entering into short-term FHLB advances, depending on the rates offered by FHLB. The borrowings were repaid prior to quarter end for regulatory purposes. The proceeds from the borrowings, net of the required FHLB stock holdings, which yielded 6.4% during the current quarter, were deposited at the FRB of Kansas City. Net income attributable to the leverage strategy is largely derived from the dividends received on FHLB stock holdings, plus the net interest rate spread between the yield on the cash at the FRB of Kansas City and the rate paid on the related FHLB borrowings, less applicable federal insurance premiums and estimated taxes. Net income attributable to the leverage strategy was $767 thousand during the current quarter, compared to $642 thousand for the prior year quarter and $633 thousand in the September 30, 2017 quarter. The increase was due primarily to a decrease in the fiscal year 2018 estimated effective tax rate applied to pretax income attributable to the leverage strategy.\nTotal liabilities were $7.64 billion at December 31, 2017 compared to $7.82 billion at September 30, 2017. The $185.1 million decrease was due mainly to decreases in repurchase agreements and deposits. Repurchase agreements decreased due to the maturity of a $100.0 million repurchase agreement during the quarter. Deposits decreased $43.7 million, to $5.27 billion at December 31, 2017, due mainly to a decrease in wholesale certificates.\nStockholders' equity was $1.35 billion at December 31, 2017 compared to $1.37 billion at September 30, 2017. The $17.7 million decrease was due primarily to the payment of $50.4 million in cash dividends, partially offset by net income of $31.8 million. The cash dividends paid during the current quarter totaled $0.375 per share and consisted of a $0.29 per share cash true-up dividend related to fiscal year 2017 earnings per the Company's dividend policy, and a regular quarterly cash dividend of $0.085 per share. On January 23, 2018, the Company announced a regular quarterly cash dividend of $0.085 per share, or approximately $11.4 million, payable on February 16, 2018 to stockholders of record as of the close of business on February 2, 2018.\nAt December 31, 2017, Capitol Federal Financial, Inc., at the holding company level, had $90.6 million on deposit at the Bank. For fiscal year 2018, it is the intent of the Board of Directors and management to continue with the payout of 100% of the Company's earnings to its stockholders. Dividend payments depend upon a number of factors including the Company's financial condition and results of operations, regulatory capital requirements, regulatory limitations on the Bank's ability to make capital distributions to the Company, and the amount of cash at the holding company.\nIn October 2015, the Company announced a stock repurchase plan for up to $70.0 million of common stock. The repurchase plan does not have an expiration date.

Substantially all of the $45.7 million of commercial real estate construction loans had not yet been funded as of December 31, 2017. The Bank intends to continue to grow its commercial real estate loan portfolio through participations with correspondent lenders and other select lead banks.\nThe following table presents the Bank's commercial real estate loans and loan commitments by industry classification, as defined by the North American Industry Classification System, as of December 31, 2017. Included in the table are fixed-rate loans totaling $323.6 million at a weighted average rate of 4.07% and adjustable-rate loans totaling $128.3 million at a weighted average rate of 4.54%. The weighted average rate of fixed-rate loans is lower than that of adjustable-rate loans due to the majority of the fixed-rate loans in the portfolio at December 31, 2017 having shorter terms. Based on the terms of the construction loans as of December 31, 2017, of the $131.3 million of undisbursed amounts in the table, approximately $24.4 million is projected to be disbursed by March 31, 2018, and an additional $77.2 million is projected to be disbursed by December 31, 2018. It is possible that not all of the funds will be disbursed due to the nature of the funding of construction projects. For outstanding commitments, in certain cases, the weighted average rate presented represents our best estimate.\nUnpaid\nUndisbursed\nGross Loan\nOutstanding\n% of\nPrincipal\nAmount\nAmount\nCommitments\nTotal\nTotal\n(Dollars in thousands)\nAccommodation and food services\n$\n135,904\n$\n33,663\n$\n169,567\n$\n11,631\n$\n181,198\n40.1%\nHealth care and social assistance\n46,868\n40,969\n87,837\n23,892\n111,729\n24.7\nReal estate rental and leasing\n26,603\n34,375\n60,978\n—\n60,978\n13.5\nArts, entertainment, and recreation\n33,534\n—\n33,534\n—\n33,534\n7.4\nMulti-family\n10,168\n20,950\n31,118\n—\n31,118\n6.9\nRetail trade\n25,577\n1,374\n26,951\n—\n26,951\n6.0\nManufacturing\n6,428\n—\n6,428\n—\n6,428\n1.4\n$\n285,082\n$\n131,331\n$\n416,413\n$\n35,523\n$\n451,936\n100.0%\nWeighted average rate\n4.13%\n4.40%\n4.21%\n4.07%\n4.20%\nThe following table summarizes the Bank's commercial real estate loans and loan commitments by state as of December 31, 2017.\nUnpaid\nUndisbursed\nGross Loan\nOutstanding\n% of\nPrincipal\nAmount\nAmount\nCommitments\nTotal\nTotal\n(Dollars in thousands)\nTexas\n$\n105,618\n$\n67,646\n$\n173,264\n$\n—\n$\n173,264\n38.3%\nMissouri\n74,562\n41,235\n115,797\n35,523\n151,320\n33.5\nKansas\n74,481\n—\n74,481\n—\n74,481\n16.5\nNebraska\n—\n20,950\n20,950\n—\n20,950\n4.6\nColorado\n14,622\n—\n14,622\n—\n14,622\n3.2\nArkansas\n7,934\n—\n7,934\n—\n7,934\n1.8\nCalifornia\n6,428\n—\n6,428\n—\n6,428\n1.4\nMontana\n1,437\n1,500\n2,937\n—\n2,937\n0.7\n$\n285,082\n$\n131,331\n$\n416,413\n$\n35,523\n$\n451,936\n100.0%\nThe following table presents the Bank's commercial real estate loan portfolio and outstanding loan commitments, categorized by gross loan amount (unpaid principal plus undisbursed amounts) or outstanding loan commitment amount, as of December 31, 2017.\nCount\nAmount\n(Dollars in thousands)\nGreater than $30 million\n4\n$\n156,770\n>$15 to $30 million\n7\n166,271\n>$10 to $15 million\n3\n37,376\n>$5 to $10 million\n2\n14,363\n$1 to $5 million\n24\n70,181\nLess than $1 million\n15\n6,975\n55\n$\n451,936\nAsset Quality\nThe following tables present loans 30 to 89 days delinquent, non-performing loans, and OREO as of the dates indicated.

The effective rate and WAM presented include the effect of the interest rate swaps.\nAverage Rates and Lives\nAt December 31, 2017, the Bank's gap between the amount of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities projected to reprice within one year was $185.2 million, or 2.06% of total assets, compared to $641.6 million, or 6.98% of total assets, at September 30, 2017. The decrease in the one-year gap amount was due primarily to a decrease in the amount of cash held at December 31, 2017, along with a decrease in the amount of mortgage-related assets projected to reprice due to higher interest rates. As interest rates rise, borrowers have less economic incentive to refinance their mortgages and agency debt issuers have less economic incentive or opportunity to exercise their call options in order to issue new debt at lower interest rates. This increase in interest rates resulted in lower projected cash flows on these assets over the next year compared to September 30, 2017.\nThe majority of interest-earning assets anticipated to reprice in the coming year are repayments and prepayments on mortgage loans and MBS, both of which include the option to prepay without a fee being paid by the contract holder. The amount of interest-bearing liabilities expected to reprice in a given period is not typically impacted significantly by changes in interest rates because the Bank's borrowings and certificate of deposit portfolios have contractual maturities and generally cannot be terminated early without a prepayment penalty. If interest rates were to increase 200 basis points, as of December 31, 2017, the Bank's one-year gap is projected to be $(305.9) million, or (3.40)% of total assets. This compares to a one-year gap of $81.3 million, or 0.88% of total assets, if interest rates were to have increased 200 basis points as of September 30, 2017.\nDuring the current quarter, loan repayments totaled $283.9 million and cash flows from the securities portfolio totaled $69.9 million. The asset cash flows of $353.8 million were reinvested into new assets at current market interest rates. Total cash flows from fixed-rate liabilities that matured or repriced during the current quarter were approximately $600.0 million, including $200.0 million of term borrowings. These offsetting cash flows allow the Bank to manage its interest rate risk and gap position more precisely than if the Bank did not have offsetting cash flows due to its mix of assets or maturity structure of liabilities.\nOther strategies include managing the Bank's wholesale assets and liabilities. The Bank primarily uses long-term fixed-rate borrowings with no embedded options to lengthen the average life of the Bank's liabilities. The fixed-rate characteristics of these borrowings lock-in the cost until maturity and thus decrease the amount of liabilities repricing as interest rates move higher compared to funding with lower-cost short-term borrowings. These borrowings are laddered in order to prevent large amounts of liabilities repricing in any one period. The WAL of the Bank's term borrowings as of December 31, 2017 was 2.2 years. However, including the impact of interest rate swaps related to $200.0 million of adjustable-rate FHLB advances, the WAL of the Bank's term borrowings as of December 31, 2017 was 2.7 years. The interest rate swaps effectively convert the adjustable-rate borrowings into long-term, fixed-rate liabilities.\nThe Bank uses the securities portfolio to shorten the average life of the Bank's assets. Purchases in the securities portfolio over the past couple of years have primarily been focused on callable agency debentures with maturities no longer than five years, shorter duration MBS, and adjustable-rate MBS. These securities have a shorter average life and provide a steady source of cash flow that can be reinvested as interest rates rise or used to purchase higher-yielding assets. The WAL of the Bank's securities portfolio as of December 31, 2017 was 2.5 years.\nIn addition to the wholesale strategies, the Bank has sought to increase core deposits and long-term certificates of deposit. Core deposits are expected to reduce the risk of higher interest rates because their interest rates are not expected to increase significantly as market interest rates rise. Specifically, checking accounts and savings accounts have had minimal interest rate fluctuations throughout historical interest rate cycles, though no assurance can be given that this will be the case in future interest rate cycles. The balances and rates of these accounts have historically tended to remain very stable over time, giving them the characteristic of long-term liabilities. The Bank uses historical data pertaining to these accounts to estimate their future balances. At December 31, 2017 the WAL of the Bank's non-maturity deposits was 13.5 years.\nOver the last couple years, the Bank has priced long-term certificates of deposit more aggressively than short-term certificates of deposit with the goal of giving customers incentive to move funds into longer-term certificates of deposit when interest rates were lower. The balance of our retail certificates of deposit with terms of 36 months or longer increased $253.1 million, or 18%, since December 31, 2015. Long-term certificates of deposit reduce the amount of liabilities repricing as interest rates rise in a given time period.\nBecause of the on-balance sheet strategies implemented over the past several years, management believes the Bank is well-positioned to move into a market rate environment where interest rates are higher.\nThe following table presents the weighted average yields/rates and WALs (in years), after applying prepayment, call assumptions, and decay rates for our interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities as of December 31, 2017. Yields presented for interest-earning assets include the amortization of fees, costs, premiums and discounts, which are considered adjustments to the yield. The interest rate presented for term borrowings is the effective rate, which includes the impact of interest rate swaps and amortization of deferred prepayment penalties resulting from FHLB advances previously prepaid. The WAL presented for term borrowings includes the effect of interest rate swaps. The maturity and repricing terms presented for one- to four-family loans represent the contractual terms of the loan.\nAmount\nYield/Rate\nWAL\n% of Category\n% of Total\n(Dollars in thousands)\nInvestment securities\n$\n321,452\n1.40%\n1.2\n25.3%\n3.7%\nMBS - fixed\n612,450\n2.15\n2.9\n48.1\n7.1\nMBS - adjustable\n338,788\n2.59\n5.1\n26.6\n3.9\nTotal securities\n1,272,690\n2.07\n3.0\n100.0%\n14.7\nLoans receivable:\nFixed-rate one- to four-family:\n<= 15 years\n1,177,173\n3.08\n4.0\n16.4%\n13.6\n> 15 years\n4,451,629\n3.84\n6.0\n62.0\n51.3\nAll other fixed-rate loans\n277,219\n4.22\n3.8\n3.9\n3.2\nTotal fixed-rate loans\n5,906,021\n3.71\n5.5\n82.3\n68.1\nAdjustable-rate one- to four-family:\n<= 36 months\n260,703\n1.80\n3.5\n3.6\n3.0\n> 36 months\n842,492\n3.10\n2.6\n11.7\n9.7\nAll other adjustable-rate loans\n168,288\n4.89\n3.4\n2.4\n1.9\nTotal adjustable-rate loans\n1,271,483\n3.07\n2.9\n17.7\n14.6\nTotal loans receivable\n7,177,504\n3.59\n5.1\n100.0%\n82.7\nFHLB stock\n195,470\n6.49\n1.1\n2.3\nCash and cash equivalents\n29,120\n1.36\n—\n0.3\nTotal interest-earning assets\n$\n8,674,784\n3.43\n4.7\n100.0%\nNon-maturity deposits\n$\n2,444,245\n0.24\n13.5\n46.4%\n32.4%\nRetail certificates of deposit\n2,419,380\n1.57\n1.8\n45.9\n32.1\nPublic units\n402,592\n1.37\n0.8\n7.7\n5.3\nTotal deposits\n5,266,217\n0.94\n7.2\n100.0%\n69.8\nTerm borrowings\n2,175,000\n2.09\n2.7\n95.6%\n28.9\nFHLB line of credit\n100,000\n1.47\n—\n4.4\n1.3\nTotal borrowings\n2,275,000\n2.06\n2.6\n100.0%\n30.2\nTotal interest-bearing liabilities\n$\n7,541,217\n1.28\n5.8\n100.0%\nAverage Balance Sheets\nThe following table presents the average balances of our assets, liabilities, and stockholders' equity, and the related annualized weighted average yields and rates on our interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities for the periods indicated and the weighted average yield/rate on our interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities at December 31, 2017, as well as selected performance ratios and other information as of the dates and for the periods shown.

The FHLB advance amounts and rates included in this line include the effect of interest rate swaps and are net of deferred prepayment penalties.\n(6)\nNet interest income represents the difference between interest income earned on interest-earning assets and interest paid on interest-bearing liabilities. Net interest income depends on the balance of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities, and the interest rates earned or paid on them.\n(7)\nNet interest rate spread represents the difference between the average yield on interest-earning assets and the average cost of interest-bearing liabilities.\n(8)\nThe table below provides a reconciliation between certain performance ratios presented in accordance with GAAP and the performance ratios excluding the effects of the leverage strategy, which are not presented in accordance with GAAP. Management believes it is important for comparability purposes to provide the performance ratios without the leverage strategy because of the unique nature of the leverage strategy. The leverage strategy reduces some of our performance ratios due to the amount of earnings associated with the transaction in comparison to the size of the transaction, while increasing our net income.\nFor the Three Months Ended\nDecember 31, 2017\nSeptember 30, 2017\nDecember 31, 2016\nActual\nLeverage\nAdjusted\nActual\nLeverage\nAdjusted\nActual\nLeverage\nAdjusted\n(GAAP)\nStrategy\n(Non-GAAP)\n(GAAP)\nStrategy\n(Non-GAAP)\n(GAAP)\nStrategy\n(Non-GAAP)\nReturn on average assets (annualized)\n1.15%\n(0.22)%\n1.37%\n0.74%\n(0.14)%\n0.88%\n0.73%\n(0.14)%\n0.87%\nReturn on average equity (annualized)\n9.33\n0.22\n9.11\n6.03\n0.19\n5.84\n5.91\n0.18\n5.73\nNet interest margin\n1.83\n(0.37)\n2.20\n1.84\n(0.37)\n2.21\n1.73\n(0.34)\n2.07\nNet interest rate spread\n1.69\n(0.33)\n2.02\n1.71\n(0.33)\n2.04\n1.61\n(0.29)\n1.90\n(9)\nNet interest margin represents annualized net interest income as a percentage of average interest-earning assets.\n(10)\nThe operating expense ratio represents annualized non-interest expense as a percentage of average assets.\n(11)\nThe efficiency ratio represents non-interest expense as a percentage of the sum of net interest income (pre-provision for credit losses) and non-interest income.\n(12)\nThe pre-tax yield on the leverage strategy represents annualized pre-tax income resulting from the transaction as a percentage of the average interest-earning assets associated with the transaction.\nView original content: http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/capitol-federal-financial-inc-reports-first-quarter-fiscal-year-2018-results-300589302.html\nSOURCE Capitol Federal Financial, Inc.", "external_links": ["http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/capitol-federal-financial-inc-reports-first-quarter-fiscal-year-2018-results-300589302.html"], "published": "2018-01-29T16:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-29T20:00:23.001+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
