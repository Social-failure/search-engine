Until now we hope that the trip will be maintained ... we’ll see what the final outcome is.”\nSlideshow (2 Images) Heavy snow in the Alps has made travel difficult in many regions given the heightened danger of avalanches.\nThe main road leading to Davos was covered with snow. The town’s website for avalanche information advised people in nearly 30 residences to seek more secure dwellings for Sunday evening.\nSchwab said he wasn’t worried that weather would prevent attendees from coming to the event, which officially starts on Tuesday.\n“No, I‘m happy because it provides Davos with what it should be -- the aspect of a global village, but a village where you know nature plays still a very important role and, in our discussion, the whole environmental issue will also be at the forefront of what we do here,” he said.\nReporting by Alex Threlfall; Writing by Michael Shields; Editing by Sonya Hepinstall\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-21T18:16:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-21T18:33:16.016+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
