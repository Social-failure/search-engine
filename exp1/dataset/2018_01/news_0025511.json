Diluted earnings per common share of $0.97 in the fourth quarter of 2017 were $0.15 higher than the fourth quarter of 2016 and $0.09 higher than the third quarter of 2017. The fourth quarter of 2017 included $0.09 of notable items, including a benefit of $910 million related to the estimated impact of tax reform on the Company’s tax related assets and liabilities, partially offset by a $608 million accrual for regulatory and legal matters, and $152 million, net of tax, for a charitable contribution to the U.S. Bank Foundation and a special bonus to certain eligible employees. The regulatory and legal accrual is related to previously disclosed matters related to Bank Secrecy Act/anti-money laundering compliance program adequacy and investigations by the United States Attorney’s Office in Manhattan into that program and U.S. Bank National Association’s legacy banking relationship with payday lending businesses associated with a former customer. The increase in net income year-over-year was primarily due to total net revenue growth, including an increase in net interest income of 6.4 percent, mainly a result of the impact of rising interest rates and loan growth. Noninterest income increased 0.4 percent principally due to higher payment services revenue, trust and investment management fees and deposit service charges, mostly offset by a decrease in mortgage banking revenue and lower equity investment income. Excluding the notable items, the increase in total net revenue was partially offset by higher noninterest expense, primarily due to increased compensation expense related to hiring to support business growth and compliance programs, merit increases, variable compensation related to revenue growth and higher employee benefits expense, partially offset by lower professional services expense driven by lower consulting costs for risk and compliance programs. Excluding notable items, net income decreased slightly on a linked quarter basis principally due to a seasonal increase in noninterest expense of 2.5 percent driven by seasonally higher costs related to investments in tax-advantaged projects in addition to higher employee benefits and professional services expense. These increases were partially offset by an increase in total net revenue of 0.5 percent, reflecting an increase in net interest income of 0.3 percent primarily driven by loan growth, and an increase in noninterest income of 0.8 percent related to higher trust and investment management fees and payment services revenue.\nU.S. Bancorp President and Chief Executive Officer Andy Cecere said, “Our fourth quarter results were a strong end to what was a record year for U.S. Bancorp on several measures: we delivered record net revenue, net income, and diluted earnings per common share. Excluding notable items, our fourth quarter performance metrics were highlighted by a return on average common equity of 13.4 percent and a return on average assets of 1.33 percent. In the fourth quarter we returned 72 percent of earnings to shareholders through dividends and share buybacks.\n“The economic backdrop is favorable, and tax reform legislation enacted late last year has provided us an ", "external_links": ["http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180117005303/en/", "http://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.usbank.com&esheet=51743731&newsitemid=20180117005303&lan=en-US&anchor=www.usbank.com&index=1&md5=ef353ab95cd2640f1bb8467c670868d3", "http://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.usbank.com&esheet=51743731&newsitemid=20180117005303&lan=en-US&anchor=www.usbank.com&index=2&md5=b24632503d3f6b3eb2c240a74fab0f96"], "published": "2018-01-17T14:45:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-17T15:50:06.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
