The three major U.S. stock indexes ended lower after a choppy trading session, while benchmark 10-year Treasury yields jumped to a 10-month high. Asia shares ex-Japan were down 0.5 percent as of 0400 GMT. \"The weakness on Wall Street could have been a catalyst for a profit-taking from the global rally seen across most regions,\" said Fio De Jesus, equity research analyst at RCBC Securities in Manila. In Southeast Asia, Philippines fell as much as 1.7 percent on broad-based losses, its worst intra-day decline in almost three months. Index heavyweights PLDT Inc dropped 3.2 percent, while SM Investments Corp fell 2.5 percent. \"A lot of the proxy stocks that have big weighting on the index are seeing some profit-taking, although the fundamentals haven't really changed,\" De Jesus said. Thailand extended losses into a second straight session, dragged down by industrials and materials. Airports of Thailand PCL declined 1.8 percent, while PTT Global Chemical PCL fell 0.8 percent. Malaysia fell as much as 0.5 percent, with utilities and telecom stocks accounting for more than half of the losses on the index. Axiata Group Bhd was down 0.9 percent, while Tenaga Nasional Bhd declined 0.4 percent. Malaysia's industrial production rose 5 percent in November from a year earlier, boosted by gains in all three major sectors, government data showed on Thursday. Singapore's FTSE Straits Times Index edged down, with Jardine Strategic Holdings Ltd, the biggest drag on the index, falling 1.3 percent. Hutchison Port Holdings Trust lost 1.2 percent. Indonesia recovered after two sessions of losses, with energy stocks among the biggest gainers. Bayan Resources Tbk PT surged 11.6 percent.
