The capital market is very impatient,” Ingo Speich, a fund manager at Union Investment, told Frankfurter Allgemeine. \n“There is no proof so far that Deutsche Bank’s strategy will ever lead to success,” he said. \nGermany’s biggest bank announced an overhaul in March last year that included integrating its Postbank retail bank with its in-house consumer bank in an effort to cut costs, as well as the partial sale of its asset management business. \nOne source told Reuters on Saturday that Deutsche Bank aimed to go ahead with the flotation as soon as possible, which could be in March or April. \nThe offering’s prospectus, which has to be approved by financial watchdog Bafin, has not yet been completed, the person added. \nFrankfurt Allgemeine earlier said that Deutsche Bank aimed to float the asset management business, which could achieve a total valuation of around 8 billion euros, in March at the latest. \n($1 = 0.8052 euros)", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-27T15:49:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-27T16:18:01.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
