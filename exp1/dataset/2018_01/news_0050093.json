The vessel is located in the North Atlantic’s White Rose oilfield, around 350 kilometers (217 miles) east off the coast of the province of Newfoundland and Labrador. \n(This version of the story corrects the location of SeaRose to off the coast of Newfoundland and Labrador, not New Brunswick in the last paragraph) Reporting by Julie GordonEditing by Marguerita Choy", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-26T23:47:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-27T00:04:07.025+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
