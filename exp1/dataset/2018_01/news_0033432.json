Hussain said an avalanche warning was issued late on Wednesday. \nThe Swedish embassy in New Delhi had been informed about the accident, an official at the Gulmarg Development Authority said. \nA decades-old dispute over the mostly Muslim region of Kashmir, claimed in full but ruled in part by both Pakistan and India, has heated up after a 2003 ceasefire brought more than a decade of relative peace.
