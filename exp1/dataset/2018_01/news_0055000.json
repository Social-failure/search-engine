(NYSE: DPS) (\"Dr Pepper\") breached their fiduciary duties in connection with the proposed merger of the Company with Keurig Green Mountain, Inc. (\"Keurig\").\nOn January 29, 2018, Dr Pepper announced that it had signed a definitive merger agreement with Keurig. Under the terms of the agreement, Dr Pepper shareholders will receive $103.75 per share in a special cash dividend and retain 13% of the combined company.\nThe investigation concerns whether the Dr Pepper board failed to satisfy its duties to the Company shareholders, including whether the board adequately pursued alternatives to the merger and whether the board obtained the best price possible for Dr Pepper shares of common stock.\nIf you are a shareholder of Dr Pepper and believe the proposed merger price is too low or you're interested in learning more about the investigation or your legal rights and remedies, please contact lead analyst Jim Baker ( jimb@johnsonfistel.com ) at 619-814-4471.
