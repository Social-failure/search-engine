The country’s steel output is expected to have hit a record 832 million tonnes in 2017.\nAverage air pollution in Linfen, an industrial city in Shanxi province that was not part of the government action plan, rose significantly last year, according to Reuters calculations of data from the independent website www.aqistudy.cn, which tracks official air quality data.\nBy contrast Taiyuan, the capital of Shanxi about 250 kilometers (155 miles) from Linfen and part of the 28 city campaign, showed a modest improvement in air quality last year.\nGreenpeace said that PM2.5 levels fell by 40 percent year-on-year in the 28 cities during the peak period for heating from mid-October to mid-March, and by only 23 percent in the surrounding cities.\nReporting by Elias Glenn and Muyu Xu; Additional reporting by the Beijing newsroom; Editing by Susan Fenton\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-11T04:11:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-11T04:32:35.006+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
