Net income surged 40 percent to 899 million euros.\nPhilips’ profit margin improved by 110 basis points in 2017, to 12.1 percent of sales, surpassing the company’s own goal by 10 percent as cost savings were higher than expected.\nReporting by Bart Meijer; Editing by Sherry Jacob-Phillips and Sunil Nair\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-01-30T14:28:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-31T16:18:17.010+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
