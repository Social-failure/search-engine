Kato was an incredibly talented player, with a bright future ahead of him in Rugby League. \n”This news is all the more tragic, because Kato was due to travel to the UK this week to fulfil his dream of playing first-grade Rugby League. We had been in regular contact with Kato and were excited to welcome a bright, excited and passionate young man, who had genuine potential for the future. \n“Widnes Vikings will of course be looking to celebrate Kato’s life and pay our sincere respects to someone who we believe would have become a hero at our club”. \nThe club said they were “still learning the full facts of this situation”.
