Steinhoff said the timeline for the completion of the investigation remained uncertain.\nThe company had reported a 1.4 billion euros ($1.69 billion) net profit in 2016 while its 2015 accounts showed earnings of 959 million euros, according to Steinhoff’s annual reports.\n“The latest information confirms what we’ve suspected all along (about the reliability of the results for 2015 and beyond),” one hedge fund manager said, declining to be named. “What we’re eagerly waiting for is the outcome of the PwC investigation.”\nThe accounting scandal marks a fall from grace for the retailer which has grown rapidly via an international M&A spree that began in 2011 with the acquisition of Conforama, Europe’s second biggest furniture retailer.\nIt has also tainted the reputation of Steinhoff’s chairman and biggest shareholder Christo Wiese, considered one of South Africa’s most respected stewards of shareholder capital.\nShares in Steinhoff, once dubbed Africa’s IKEA, have fallen around 90 percent since news of the accounting irregularities broke in early December, wiping 185 billion rand ($14.99 billion) off its market value.\nIt warned then that there was a 2 billion euro ($2.4 billion) hole in its balance sheet and has since said that some credit facilities have been suspended or withdrawn as it grapples with more than 10 billion euros in outstanding debt.\nSeparately, the company has been under investigation for suspected accounting fraud in Germany since 2015. It moved its primary share listing from Johannesburg to Frankfurt late that year.\nFour current and former managers are under suspicion of having overstated revenue at subsidiaries, prosecutors said.\nSteinhoff has said the German investigation relates to whether revenue was booked properly, and whether taxable profits were correctly declared.\nSteinhoff shares were up nearly 8 percent in Johannesburg at 1256 GMT.\nEditing by Ed Stoddard and Jane Merriman\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-02T10:55:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-02T11:17:21.006+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
