Turkey sees the YPG as an extension of the outlawed Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK), which has waged a deadly insurgency in Turkey’s largely Kurdish southeast for three decades.\nThe Turkish presidency said in a statement on Saturday that Ibrahim Kalin, spokesman for President Tayyip Erdogan, and U.S. National Security Adviser H.R. McMaster held a phone call on Friday in which McMaster confirmed the United States would no longer provide weapons to the YPG.\nOn Thursday, the Pentagon said it carefully tracked weapons provided to the YPG and would continue discussions with Turkey, after Ankara urged Washington to end its support for the YPG or risk confronting Turkish forces on the ground in Syria.\nOn Friday, Erdogan said Turkish forces would sweep Kurdish fighters from the Syrian border and could push all the way east to the frontier with Iraq - a move which risks a possible confrontation with U.S. forces allied to the Kurds.\nWomen inspect a mosque which was hit by a rocket fired from Syria, in the border town of Kilis, Turkey January 25, 2018. REUTERS/Umit Bektas Since the start of the incursion, dubbed “Operation Olive Branch” by Ankara, Erdogan has said Turkish forces would push east towards the town of Manbij, part of Kurdish-held territory some 100 km (60 miles) east of Afrin, where U.S. troops were deployed to deter Turkish and U.S.-backed rebels from clashing.\nAny Turkish advance towards Manbij could threaten U.S. efforts to stabilize northern Syria, where the United States has about 2,000 troops, officially as part of the international coalition against Islamic State.\nIn a sign of growing bilateral tensions, Ankara and Washington disagreed over the main message of a phone call between Erdogan and U.S. President Donald Trump held on Wednesday.\nThe White House said Trump had urged Erdogan to curtail the military operation in Syria, while Turkey said Erdogan had told Trump that U.S. troops should withdraw from Manbij.\nRelated Coverage Turkey says U.S. needs to withdraw from Syria's Manbij region immediately Pentagon spokeswoman Dana White said she had seen media reports about the phone call, but was not aware of any change in U.S. posture.\nThe Turkish presidency said Kalin and McMaster had agreed for Turkey and the United States to remain in close coordination to “avoid misunderstandings”.\nReporting by Tuvan Gumrukcu; Editing by Mark Potter\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-27T11:01:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-27T11:14:59.009+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
