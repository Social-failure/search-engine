The group has renamed itself the Revolutionary Alternative Common Force, preserving its FARC initials. \n“I am committed to heading up a transitional government which will create the conditions for the birth of a new Colombia,” said long-time rebel leader and presidential candidate Rodrigo Londono, known by his nom de guerre Timochenko, to cheering supporters in a working-class neighborhood in southern Bogota. \n“May the voice of those below, those millions and millions of poor who have never counted, may they be listened to, may they decide their future,” Londono added.

Recent opinion polls have shown little support for the party.
