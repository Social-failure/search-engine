Mandatory Credit: Mark J. Rebilas-USA TODAY Sports He clearly possesses impressive motivational tools as he steered his team through the playoffs after starting quarterback Carson Wentz went down with a season-ending injury last month.\nThe Eagles have clearly bought into Pederson’s next-man-up attitude but his impact on the team goes much deeper.\nPederson, in only his second year as a NFL head coach, has already gained a reputation as one of the league’s most aggressive tacticians.\nOpposing teams are well aware he is not shy to go for it on fourth downs and that he enjoys taking shots down the field, even with backup quarterback Nick Foles now at the helm of the Eagles offense.\nStill, the Eagles will be an underdog in the Super Bowl, a role that Pederson said his players are not fussed about.\n“Our guys don’t read into too much about what’s written or said. Our guys just go about their business every single day. We know what we’re faced against, we know the opponent we’re going against,” said Pederson.\n“Lot of respect for them obviously and what they’ve done and what they’ve accomplished,” said Pederson.\n“It’s about what we do. How our players handle this week and eliminate distractions and eliminate the noise and how well they prepare and get themselves ready to go.”\nEditing by Greg Stutchbury\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-31T01:19:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-31T01:39:57.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
