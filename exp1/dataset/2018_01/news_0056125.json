It has been the greenback's heaviest monthly drop against the Chinese currency since 1994 having lost more that 3 percent.\nOther action had seen the yen briefly slip after the Bank of Japan increased its buying of medium-term Japanese government bonds (JGBs) in a move seen as a warning shot against further rises in its bond yields and currency.\nThe dollar later pared its gains and was last trading at 108.68 yen.\nAgainst the euro and pound though it backed up all the way to $1.2445 and $1.4165 respectively.\nIn the opening weeks of 2018, Europe recorded the highest equity inflows across all major regions, added to a strong 2017 which saw the region cornering over one-third of all global equity fund flows.\nAll eyes will be on the outcome of the Federal Reserve's first meeting of the year later which will also be Janet Yellen's last in charge.\nRates markets are currently pricing in a little over 80 percent chance of another Fed rate hike in March and between two and three for the year as a whole.\n\"In light of the steady stream of favorable data, it is possible that the FOMCs (Fed's) statement upgrades language on activity somewhat, which could be viewed as a marginally hawkish shift,\" analysts at BNP Paribas said in a note.\n(Reporting by Marc Jones; Editing by Raissa Kasolowsky)", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-31T12:01:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-31T21:05:25.017+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
