He has been tested so many times here, it is no worry he has any doping problem, just a bad day for him to be tested,” the Frenchman added. \n“It’s a special event for him to miss a drugs test because he will certainly be somewhere else with his agent.” \nSanchez could make his Manchester United debut against fourth-tier Yeovil Town at Huish Park in the FA Cup fourth round on Friday.
