Smart-home devices and appliances remain growth areas, while we anticipate weaker trends in computing and mobile phones.\" \nFeldman added that given Best Buy's impressive performance in 2017, the new year will likely make for challenging same-store sales comparisons â€” a closely watched metric in retail. He anticipates same-store sales of -1.5 percent in the second quarter and -1 percent in the third quarter. \nBest Buy shares are up roughly 70 percent the last 12 months after the retailer showed there still may be a place for an in-store experience with electronics. \nThe analyst's new 12-month price target of $81 represents 5 percent upside from Wednesday's close. \nDana Telsey, CEO of Telsey Advisory Group, is a widely followed voice in the retail space . Before founding her firm in 2006, she spent over a decade at Bear, Stearns & Co. covering retail as a senior managing director and is consistently ranked as a top stock picker in the industry.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-25T15:13:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-25T15:40:39.015+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
