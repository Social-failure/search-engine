Both Thang and Thanh were prosecuted for other corruption cases, separate from Monday’s case. \nCritics say the crackdown is also politically motivated, however, and is targeting those close to former premier Nguyen Tan Dung after the influence of Vietnam’s conservative security forces grew in 2016 following a power struggle in the party. PRISON TRUCKS \nPolicemen escorted Thang and Thanh separately to the courtroom in prison trucks. They wore simple shirts and jackets as judges in dark gowns read their sentences in images broadcast by state media. \nThe courtroom was packed with judges, defendants, police as well as lawyers and other officials. Only a few state-run media were allowed in, while other reporters watched the televised trial from a separate room. \nForeign media were not permitted to attend the trial or allowed in the televised room but some foreign embassy staff were reportedly given access. \nThanh was a former chairman of PVN’s unit PetroVietnam Construction before becoming a vice chairman for the Hau Giang province, where he was found to have a luxury Lexus car with a government license plate, causing an outcry in a country where officials are supposed to live modestly. \nAuthorities have mostly focused on the banking and energy sectors but the campaign has spread to other industries, including real estate, and provincial offices of the ruling Communist Party of Vietnam. \nPVN is a tangled enterprise of 15 direct units, 18 subsidiaries and 46 affiliates in which it owns smaller stakes with hundreds of millions of dollars in losses racked up at units such as banks, power plants and textile mills. \nThe PetroVietnam scandal is connected to the banking sector through a deal in which the oil firm lost $35 million in an investment in Ocean Bank. \nThe lender’s former chief executive, a previous PetroVietnam chairman, was sentenced to death. \nThanh and Thang both apologised to the Communist Party in statements to the Hanoi court last week.
