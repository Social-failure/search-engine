He did not elaborate. \nThe plant, Samsungâ€™s first U.S. appliances factory in more than three decades, was among a long list of investment pledges by global companies reacting to pressure from Trump to create more U.S. jobs. \nReporting by Joyce Lee; Editing by Muralikumar Anantharaman\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-03T13:05:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-03T13:16:08.003+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
