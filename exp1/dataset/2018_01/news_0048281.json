The decision to disqualify my candidacy means that the political rights are being handicapped.”\nFILE PHOTO: Disqualified lawmaker Nathan Law, and student activists Agnes Chow and Joshua Wong (L-R) react outside Central Government Offices in Hong Kong, China December 27, 2017. Picture taken December 27, 2017. REUTERS/Tyrone Siu Demosisto described the ban as “payback” against an entire generation.\n“Demosisto members have both been imprisoned and barred from entering the political establishment. The government’s motivation is to demolish the youth’s desire to push forward social change in Hong Kong,” it said in a statement. “Momentum gained from the Umbrella movement will be absent from the legislature.”\nOn Tuesday, Chow’s close friend and student protest leader Joshua Wong was released on bail, less than a week after he was jailed for a second time for the Umbrella movement pro-democracy protests in 2014 that blocked the Chinese-ruled city’s major roads for months.\nThe protests marked the semi-autonomous city’s largest show of defiance against Beijing rule since 1997.\nThe by-election is one of several made necessary after the Chinese parliament issued a legal interpretation that eventually led to the debarring of six opposition lawmakers, leaving the pro-democracy camp with 24 seats in the 70-seat legislature and also effectively taking away some of its veto powers.\nIf Chow’s candidacy had been approved and she had gone on to win her seat, she would have been Hong Kong’s youngest ever lawmaker.\nReporting By Anne Marie Roantree and Pak Yiu; Editing by Nick Macfie\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-27T08:31:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-27T08:52:52.028+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
