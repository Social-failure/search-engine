Mr. Caswell's vision and operational leadership facilitated the growth of the Health Services Segment, the Company's largest book of business. Under Mr. Caswell's leadership, the Health Services Segment grew more than 300% over the last ten years, and he led the Company's strategy in helping governments navigate major health policy reform efforts and implement solutions to meet changing requirements. Mr. Caswell expanded the Company's core capabilities to include a growing level of clinical expertise within the assessments and appeals portfolio. He spearheaded the enhancement of the Company's technology, automation, operational analytics and digital solutions, which resulted in more streamlined operations and greater operating leverage through standardized shared services.\nPeter B. Pond, Chairman of the MAXIMUS Board of Directors, commented, \"We are pleased to promote Bruce to the role of Chief Executive Officer and we expect a seamless transition as he begins this new position. Bruce is a seasoned operator, well known to the investment community, and a well-respected thought leader in the implementation of public policy reform efforts and the delivery of complex solutions to improve government programs. We are confident that Bruce will draw from his exemplary record of accomplishment to lead MAXIMUS in providing high-quality services to governments and delivering long-term shareholder value.\"\nMr. Montoni, who will remain at the Company as Senior Advisor to the CEO, commented, \"Bruce is the right choice to succeed as CEO of MAXIMUS. He possesses the business and leadership skills, broad industry experience and deep expertise to help guide MAXIMUS in the future. Having worked with Bruce for more than a decade, I look forward to supporting him in facilitating the ongoing development and long-term mission of MAXIMUS. Succession planning has always been a key component of our long-term strategy, and I thank the Board for their steadfast support and commitment during my tenure as CEO.\"\nThe MAXIMUS Board of Directors has nominated Mr. Caswell to stand for election as a director and has nominated Mr. Montoni to stand for re-election as a director at the Company's Annual Meeting of Shareholders on March 14, 2018.
