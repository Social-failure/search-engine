The president said overhauling social safety net programs is \"going to have to be bipartisan.\" \nRyan, a Wisconsin Republican, echoed that sentiment, saying he wants a \"bipartisan consensus\" on entitlement reform. \nThe comments from Ryan and Trump all but assure the Republican-held Congress will not move toward its long-held goal in the near future. \nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has previously said he does not think the GOP-majority Senate could pass a welfare reform bill on a partisan basis. Republicans, who hold 51 seats, would need to win nine Democratic votes to overcome a likely filibuster in the chamber. \nThis is breaking news.
