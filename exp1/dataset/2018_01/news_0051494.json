Four years after injection, the Glaxo vaccine remained about 90 percent effective in people over age 70, while the efficacy of Zostavax declines noticeably over time.\nOlder adults are most at risk for an outbreak of shingles, a painful, often debilitating blistering rash that results from reactivation of the varicella-zoster virus, which causes chickenpox and remains latent in those who have had that disease.\nReporting by Arathy S Nair in Bengaluru\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-26T14:49:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-26T15:51:37.014+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
