But they will have to return to thorny budget issues that have now become intertwined with contentious immigration policy. \nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, a Republican, opened Tuesday’s Senate session saying “serious negotiations can resume on key issues such as immigration and border security, disaster relief, healthcare, and providing adequate levels of defense spending.” \nDemocratic Leader Chuck Schumer responded: ”The Republican majority now has 16 days to work with us to write a bill that can get 60 votes and prevent the Dreamers from being deported. \n“That’s not much time; got to get moving.” \nTrump himself has vacillated on immigration between tough rhetoric demanding a U.S. border wall and a softer tone urging a “bill of love” for Dreamers - immigrants brought to the United States illegally as children. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, accompanied by Sen. John Cornyn (R-TX), Sen. John Thune (R-SD), Sen. John Barrasso (R-WY) and Sen. Cory Gardner (R-CO), speaks with reporters following the party luncheons on Capitol Hill in Washington, U.S. January 23, 2018. REUTERS/Aaron P. Bernstein \nMany Republicans have said they want to help Dreamers while Democrats and some Republicans have called Trump an unreliable negotiating partner. \nTrump canceled former President Barack Obama’s Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA, program that shielded Dreamers from deportation. Without congressional action, the program will end in March.
