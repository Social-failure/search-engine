(“CBB” or the “Company”) (OTCQB: CBBI), the parent company of Commonwealth Business Bank (the “Bank”), today announced net income of $1.0 million, or $0.11 per diluted share, for the fourth quarter of 2017, compared to $3.7 million, or $0.39 per diluted share, for the prior quarter and $3.4 million, or $0.37 per diluted share, for the fourth quarter of 2016. The current quarter’s net income and earnings per diluted share were adversely impacted by a $2.0 million write down of the Company’s net deferred asset that was required under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”) when the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “Act”) was signed into law on December 22, 2017 (see “Income Tax Expense” section for further discussion). Excluding the impact of the write down of the Company’s net deferred tax asset, net income would have been $3.0 million, or $0.32 per diluted share, for the current quarter.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017, net income increased 5.4% to $12.1 million, or $1.27 per diluted share, compared to $11.4 million, or $1.24 per diluted share, for the same period in 2016. Excluding the impact of the write down of the Company’s net deferred tax asset, net income for 2017 would have been $14.1 million, or $1.49 per diluted share.\n“Our earnings for the fourth quarter and the year were negatively impacted by the write down of our net deferred tax asset due to the reduction in the federal corporate tax rate to 21%. In 2018, we believe the reduction in the tax rate will positively impact our net income by significantly reducing our effective tax rate to an estimated range of 27.50% to 29.50%,” said Joanne Kim, President and CEO. “In the fourth quarter, we opened our sixth SBA loan production office in Utah to increase our SBA loan production capability,” Ms. Kim added.\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThree Months Ended Twelve Months Ended December 31, September 30, % December 31, % December 31, December 31, % 2017 2017 Change 2016 Change 2017 2016 Change (Dollars in thousands, except per share amounts) Net income $ 1,013 $ 3,706 (72.7 %) $ 3,440 (70.6 %) $ 12,050 $ 11,437 5.4 % Diluted EPS $ 0.11 $ 0.39 (71.8 %) $ 0.37 (70.3 %) $ 1.27 $ 1.24 2.4 % Return on average assets 0.39 % 1.46 % (73.3 %) 1.53 % (74.5 %) 1.23 % 1.38 % (10.9 %) Return on average equity 3.46 % 13.08 % (73.5 %) 13.58 % (74.5 %) 10.92 % 11.80 % (7.5 %) Noninterest income/average assets 1.11 % 1.46 % (24.0 %) 1.33 % (16.5 %) 1.39 % 1.43 % (2.8 %) Pre-tax, pre-provision earnings/average assets 1.96 % 2.50 % (21.6 %) 2.58 % (24.0 %) 2.48 % 2.78 % (10.8 %) Noninterest expense/average assets 3.04 % 3.04 % - 2.57 % 18.3 % 2.91 % 2.69 % 8.2 % Efficiency ratio 60.76 % 54.85 % 10.8 % 49.93 % 21.7 % 53.96 % 49.13 % 9.8 % Net interest margin¹ 4.06 % 4.24 % (4.2 %) 3.94 % 3.0 % 4.17 % 4.16 % 0.2 % ¹ Amounts calculated on a fully taxable equivalent basis using the current statutory federal tax rate Net Interest Income and Net Interest Margin\nNet interest income was $10.2 million for the fourth quarter of 2017, a decrease of $180,000, or 1.7%, compared to $10.4 million for the prior quarter and an increase of $1.6 million, or 18.5%, compared to $8.6 million for the same quarter last year. The quarter-over-quarter decrease was primarily due to a $214,000 decrease in interest earned on loans and a $170,000 increase in interest paid on deposits, which were partially offset by a $166,000 increase in interest earned on investment securities and a $54,000 increase in interest earned on deposits at the FRB and other banks. The quarter-over-quarter decrease in interest earned on loans was primarily due to a $13.8 million decrease in the average balance of loans including loans held-for-sale to $805.6 million from $819.4 million for the prior quarter. The year-over-year quarterly increase was primarily due to a $2.0 million increase in interest earned on loans, a $307,000 increase in interest earned on investment securities and a $167,000 increase in interest earned on deposits at the FRB and other banks, which were partially offset by a $762,000 increase in interest paid on deposits. The year-over-year quarterly increase in interest earned on loans was primarily due to a $87.7 million increase in the average balance of loans combined with a 41 basis point increase in the yield on loans to 5.70% from 5.29% in the same quarter last year.\nNet interest income was $39.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, an increase of $5.5 million, or 16.3%, compared to $33.6 million for the same period last year. The annual year-over-year increase was primarily attributable to a $6.1 million increase in interest earned on loans, a $1.1 million increase in interest earned on investment securities, and a $364,000 increase in interest earned on deposits at the FRB and the other banks, which were partially offset by a $1.9 million increase in interest paid on deposits. The annual year-over-year increase in interest earned on loans was primarily due to a $91.7 million increase in the average balance of loans combined with a 14 basis point increase in the yield on loans to 5.57% from 5.43%.\nThe reported yield on our loan portfolio is impacted by a number of factors, including changes in the average contractual interest rate earned on the portfolio and the amount of discount accretion on SBA loans. The following table reconciles the contractual yield on our loan portfolio to the reported yield for the periods indicated.\nThree Months Ended Twelve Months Ended December 31, 2017 September 30, 2017 December 31, 2016 December 31, 2017 December 31, 2016 Amount Yield Amount Yield Amount Yield Amount Yield Amount Yield (Dollars in thousands) Contractual yield $ 10,717 5.28 % $ 10,824 5.23 % $ 8,705 4.82 % $ 40,864 5.17 % $ 34,229 4.90 % SBA discount accretion 850 0.42 % 969 0.47 % 792 0.44 % 3,258 0.41 % 3,014 0.43 % Prepayment penalties & late fees 82 0.04 % 117 0.06 % 140 0.08 % 389 0.05 % 500 0.07 % Amortization of net deferred costs (82 ) (0.04 %) (129 ) (0.06 %) (93 ) -0.05 % (457 ) (0.06 %) (83 ) (0.01 %) Interest recognized on nonaccrual loans - - - - - - - - 275 0.04 % As reported yield on loans $ 11,567 5.70 % $ 11,781 5.70 % $ 9,544 5.29 % $ 44,054 5.57 % $ 37,935 5.43 % The net interest margin was 4.06% for the current quarter, a decrease of 18 basis points, from 4.24% in the prior quarter and increased 12 basis points, compared to 3.94% for the year ago quarter. The quarter-over-quarter decrease was primarily due to a 14 basis point decrease in the yield on interest-earning assets to 4.96% from 5.10% in the prior quarter combined with a 5 basis point increase in our cost of funds to 0.99% from 0.94% in the prior quarter. Although our yield on loans was 5.70% in both the current and prior quarters, the quarter-over-quarter decrease in the yield on interest-earning assets was due to a decline in the percentage of higher yielding average loans to total average interest-earning assets in the current quarter compared to the prior quarter. The year-over-year quarterly increase was primarily due to a 33 basis point increase in the yield on interest-earning assets from 4.63% in the year ago quarter, which was partially offset by a 23 basis point increase in our cost of funds from 0.76% in the same period last year. The quarter-over-quarter increase in our cost of funds was primarily due to a 5 basis point increase in our cost of deposits to 0.98% in the current quarter from 0.93% in the prior quarter and the year-over-year quarterly increase in our cost of funds was primarily due to a 23 basis point increase in our cost of deposits from 0.75% in the same quarter last year.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017, the net interest margin was 4.17 %, an increase of a 1 basis point, compared to 4.16% for the same period last year. The annual year-over-year increase was primarily driven by a 12 basis point increase in the yield on interest-earning assets to 4.98% from 4.86% for the same period last year, which was partially offset by an 11 basis point increase in our cost of funds to 0.89% from 0. 78% for the same period last year. The annual year-over-year increase in CBB’s yield on interest-earning assets was primarily due to a 14 basis point increase in the yield on loans to 5.57% from 5.43% and the annual year-over-year increase in cost of funds was primarily attributable to an 11 basis point increase in our cost of deposits to 0.88% from 0.77% for the same period last year.\nProvision for Loan Losses\nThe CBB recorded no provision for loan losses in the current quarter, compared to a $164,000 provision for loan losses in the prior quarter and no provision for loan losses in the year ago quarter. For the year ended December 31, 2017, the CBB recorded a $514,000 provision for loan losses, a decrease of $3.4 million, compared to $3.9 million in the same period in 2016. The provision for loan losses in 2016 was primarily due to one $4.0 million commercial loan which was charged off in the fourth quarter of last year.\nNoninterest Income\nFor the current quarter, noninterest income totaled $2.9 million, a decrease of $810,000, or 21.7%, and a decrease of $94,000, or 3.1%, from $3.7 million and $3.0 million in the prior and year ago quarters, respectively. The quarter-over-quarter decrease was primarily driven by a $933,000 decrease in gains on sales of loans, which was partially offset by a $136,000 increase in SBA loan servicing fee income. The quarter-over-quarter decrease in gains on sales of loans was primarily due to a decrease in the amount of SBA loans we sold, while the quarter-over-quarter increase in SBA loan servicing fee income was due to an increase in the amount of SBA loans we serviced this quarter. The year-over-year quarterly decrease was primarily due to a $269,000 decrease in gains on sales of loans, which were partially offset by an $81,000 increase in SBA loan servicing fee income and a $35,000 increase in service charges on deposits. The year-over-year quarterly decrease in gains on sales of SBA loans was primarily due to a decrease in the amount of SBA loans we sold.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017, noninterest income increased $1.6 million, or 13.7% to $13.5 million from $11.9 million in the same period last year. The increase was primarily due to a $381,000 increase in service charges on deposits, a $416,000 increase in SBA loan servicing fee income, a $146,000 increase in other income, a $482,000 increase in gains of sales of loans, and a $130,000 increase in gains on sales of other real estate owned. The annual year-over-year increase in gains on sales of loans was primarily driven by a 41 basis point increase in the average premium we received on sales of SBA loans.\nAs the following table indicates, during the fourth quarter of 2017, the Company sold $22.6 million of SBA loans, compared to $37.7 million in the preceding quarter and $31.2 million in the same quarter last year. The decline in sales of SBA loans in the current quarter compared to the prior and year ago quarters was due to our decision not to sell SBA loans in the later part of the current quarter. For the year ended December 31, 2017, the Company sold $124.4 million of SBA loans, compared to $123.4 million in the same period last year. The quarterly average premium on sales of SBA loans for the current quarter was 10.41%, compared to 10.29% in the prior quarter and 9.17% in the year ago quarter. The average premium on sales of SBA loans for the year ended December 31, 2017 was 10.05%, compared to 9.64% in the same period last year. The amount of SBA loans we sell varies based on the volume of loans we originate, our liquidity needs and market conditions.\nThree Months Ended Twelve Months Ended December 31, September 30, % December 31, % December 31, December 31, % 2017 2017 Change 2016 Change 2017 2016 Change (Dollars in thousands) SBA loans held-for-sale at beginning of the quarter $ 18,626 $ 35,599 (47.7 %) $ 11,525 61.6 % $ 18,096 $ 17,809 1.6 % SBA loans originated/transferred from held-for-investment during the quarter\n32,447 20,857 55.6 % 37,833 (14.2 %) 135,039 123,986 8.9 % SBA loans sold during the quarter (22,618 ) (37,689 ) (40.0 %) (31,190 ) (27.5 %) (124,398 ) (123,448 ) 0.8 % SBA loans principal payment, net of advance (109 ) (141 ) (22.7 %) (72 ) 51.4 % (391 ) (251 ) 55.8 % SBA loans held-for-sale at end of the quarter $ 28,346 $ 18,626 52.2 % $ 18,096 56.6 % $ 28,346 $ 18,096 56.6 % Gain on sale of SBA loans $ 1,852 $ 2,781 (33.4 %) $ 2,128 (13.0 %) 9,303 8,839 5.2 % Premium on sale (weighted average) 10.41 % 10.29 % 1.2 % 9.17 % 13.5 % 10.05 % 9.64 % 4.3 % SBA loan production $ 54,496 $ 31,173 74.8 % $ 46,405 17.4 % 200,574 163,160 22.9 % Noninterest Expense\nNoninterest expense for the fourth quarter of 2017 was $8.0 million, an increase of $231,000, or 3.0%, from $7.7 million in the prior quarter and an increase of $2.2 million, or 37.4%, from $5.8 million in the year ago quarter. The quarter-over-quarter increase was primarily due to a $326,000 increase in salaries and employee benefits, a $51,000 increase in occupancy and equipment related expense, and a $78,000 increase in professional expense, which were offset by a $61,000 decrease in marketing expense, a $79,000 decrease in loan expense, and a $124,000 decrease in other expense. The quarter-over-quarter increase in salaries and employee benefit was primarily due to an increase in incentive compensation, combined with a 2 person increase in the average number of full time equivalent employees (“FTEs”) to 162 during the current quarter from 160 during the prior quarter. The quarter-over-quarter increase in occupancy and equipment related expense was primarily due to an increase in software expense related to opening new branches. The quarter-over-quarter increase in professional expense was primarily attributable to $85,000 of consulting fees related to recruiting new employees. The year-over-year quarterly increase was primarily due to a $1.2 million increase in salaries and employee benefits, a $311,000 increase in occupancy and equipment related expense, and a $348,000 increase in professional expense. The year-over-year quarterly increase in salaries and employee benefits was primarily due to a 24 person increase in the average number of FTEs from 138 during the year ago quarter combined with annual employee merit increases and an increase in employee incentive expense. The increase in occupancy and equipment related expense was due to the opening of three new branches during the current year. The increase in professional expense was attributable to $85,000 of legal fees related to the formation of the Company, $70,000 of consulting fees related to making the Company FDICIA compliant, and $85,000 of consulting fees related to recruiting new employees.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017, noninterest expense was $28.4 million, an increase of $6.0 million, or 27.0%, from $22.3 million for the same period last year. The increase was primarily due to a $2.9 million increase in salaries and employee benefits, a $779,000 increase in occupancy and equipment related expense, a $331,000 increase in marketing expense, an $815,000 increase in professional expense, and a $772,000 increase in other expense. The increase in salaries and employee benefits was primarily due to a 24 person increase in the average number of FTEs to 156 in the year ended December 31, 2017 from 132 in the same period in 2016 combined with the aforementioned increases in annual employee merit increases and an increase in employee incentive compensation. The increase in occupancy and equipment related expense was due to opening of three new branches during the current year. The increase in professional expense was primarily due to $194,000 of legal fees related to the formation of the Company, $140,000 of consulting fees related to making the Company FDICIA compliant, and $85,000 of consulting fees related to recruiting new employees. The increase in other expense was primarily driven by a $386,000 increase in provisions for expected losses on off-balance sheet loan commitments.\nAt or for the Three Months Ended At or for the Twelve Months Ended December 31, September 30, % December 31, % December 31, December 31, % 2017 2017 Change 2016 Change 2017 2016 Change (Dollars in thousands) Salaries and benefits $ 4,941 $ 4,615 7.1 % $ 3,762 31.3 % $ 17,846 $ 14,951 19.4 % FTE at end of period 161 160 0.6 % 139 15.8 % 161 139 15.8 % Average FTE during the period 162 160 1.2 % 138 17.6 % 156 132 18.2 % Salaries and benefit/average FTE¹ $ 121 $ 114 6.1 % $ 108 12.0 % $ 114 $ 113 0.9 % Salaries and benefit/average assets¹ 1.89 % 1.81 % 4.4 % 1.67 % 13.2 % 1.83 % 1.80 % 1.7 % Noninterest expense/average assets¹ 3.04 % 3.04 % - 2.57 % 18.3 % 2.91 % 2.69 % 8.2 % 1 Annualized Income Tax Expense\nIncome tax expense was $4.1 million for the quarter, or an effective tax rate of 80.29%, compared to $2.5 million, or an effective tax rate of 40.20%, for the prior quarter and $2.4 million, or an effective tax rate of 40.80%, for the year ago quarter. For the year ended December 31, 2017, the provision for income taxes was $11.6 million, or an effective tax rate of 49.13%, compared to $7.8 million, or an effective tax rate of 40.52%, in the same period last year. The quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year increases in income tax expense, and related effective tax rates, was primarily due to the aforementioned $2.0 million write down of the Company’s net deferred tax asset as a result of the passage of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which was signed into law on December 22, 2017. The Act, effective January 1, 2018, permanently reduces the Company’s federal corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%. At December 31, 2017, the Company was required under GAAP to perform a one-time re-measurement of the future benefit of utilizing its deferred tax items at the lower federal corporate tax rate. The Company is currently assessing the future impact of the Act on its operations, but currently estimates its effective tax rate in 2018 will be between 27.50% and 29.50%.\nPre-Tax, Pre-Provision Income\nFor the fourth quarter of 2017, the Bank’s pre-tax, pre-provision (“PTPP”) income was $5.1 million, a decrease of $1.2 million, or 19.2%, from $6.4 million for the prior quarter and a decrease of $671,000, or 11.5%, from $5.8 million for the same quarter last year. The decrease in PTPP income in the current quarter compared to the prior and year ago quarters was primarily due to lower gains on sales of loans and an increase in salaries and employee benefits. Annualized PTPP income to average assets decreased to 1.96% for the current quarter, compared to 2.50% for the prior quarter and 2.58% for the year ago quarter. The decrease in PTPP income to average assets for the current quarter, compared to the prior quarter and the year ago quarter was due to a decrease in PTPP income combined with an increase in average assets.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017, PTPP income was $24.2 million, an increase of $1.1 million, or 4.6%, from $23.1 million for the same period last year. PTPP income to average assets for the year ended December 31, 2017 decreased 30 basis points to 2.48% from 2.78% for the same period last year. The decrease in PTPP income to average assets for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to the same period in 2016 was due to a larger proportional increase in assets than in PTPP income.\nThree Months Ended Twelve Months Ended December 31, September 30, % December 31, % December 31, December 31, % 2017 2017 Change 2016 Change 2017 2016 Change (Dollars in thousands) PTPP income $ 5,140 $ 6,361 (19.2 %) $ 5,811 (11.5 %) $ 24,203 $ 23,128 4.6 % Average assets $ 1,038,577 $ 1,009,489 2.9 % $ 897,315 15.7 % $ 975,849 $ 831,368 17.4 % Annualized PTPP/average assets 1.96 % 2.50 % (21.6 %) 2.58 % (24.0 %) 2.48 % 2.78 % (10.8 %) PTPP, excluding gain on sale of SBA loans $ 3,281 $ 3,569 (8.1 %) $ 3,683 (10.9 %) $ 14,882 $ 14,289 4.2 % BALANCE SHEET\nAt December 31, 2017, the Company had total assets of $1.08 billion, an increase of $36.8 million, or 3.5%, from $1.04 billion at September 30, 2017 and an increase of $165.7 million, or 18.1%, from $913.2 million at December 31, 2016.

The quarter-over-quarter decrease in loans 30 to 89 days past due was primarily due to one loan totaling $192,000 that became current during the current quarter and one loan totaling $41,000 that was fully paid off during the current quarter. There were no loans 90 days or more past due and still accruing at the end of the current quarter, a decrease from $57,000 at the end of the prior quarter, and there were no loans 90 days or more past due and still accruing at the end of the year ago quarter.

The year-over-year quarterly decrease in nonperforming assets was primarily due to the sale of $1.2 million of OREO.\nThe allowance for loan losses at December 31, 2017 was $8.7 million, or 1.10% of loans receivable, compared to $8.2 million, or 1.07% of loans receivable at September 30, 2017, and $8.5 million, or 1.21%, of loans receivables at the end of the year ago quarter. The allowance for loan losses to nonperforming loans was 350.75%, 306.09%, and 274.19% at December 31, 2017, September 30, 2017, and December 31, 2016, respectively.\nCAPITAL\nAt December 31, 2017, CBB and the Bank continued to exceed all regulatory capital requirements to be classified as a “well-capitalized” institution and maintained a capital conservation buffer in excess of the minimum required to avoid limitations on capital distributions, including dividend payments, and certain discretionary bonus payments. The minimum capital conservation buffer requirement was 1.250% and 0.625% in 2017 and 2016, respectively. The capital conservation buffer is calculated as the smallest excess of a bank’s common equity tier 1, tier 1 risk-based and total risk-based capital ratios over the regulatory “adequately” capitalized minimum ratios of 4.50%, 6.00% and 8.00%, respectively. The minimum capital conservation buffer will increase an additional 0.625% at the beginning of 2018 and 2019, reaching the fully phased-in minimum of 2.500% in 2019. When the capital conservation buffer is fully phased-in in 2019, bank holding companies and banks will be required to maintain common equity tier 1, tier 1 risk-based and total risk-based capital ratios that are at least 50 basis points greater than the well-capitalized minimums to avoid the aforementioned limitations on capital distributions and discretionary bonus payments.
