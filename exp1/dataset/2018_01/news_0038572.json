His fellow forwards Manolo Gabbiadini and Shane Long have scored three and one, respectively, and Carrillo will boost manager Mauricio Pellegrino’s options up front. \nThe manager worked with Carrillo, who has scored five goals for Monaco this season, at Argentine club Estudiantes in 2015. \nSouthampton have money to spend after selling centre back Virgil van Dijk to Liverpool for a reported 75 million pounds and Pellegrino said after that deal that the club would look to bring in three players, including a striker.
