On Monday, he said installing the ‘Qsuite’ business class was taking longer than expected and that the aircraft was still being fitted out in Toulouse, France, which is where Airbus is based. \nQatar Airways’ Qsuite, unveiled last year, features forward facing seats and lie-flat double beds. \nThe “complex seat configuration” has had implications on the certification of the aircraft, though the airline had taken ownership of the aircraft late last year, Baker said, without giving details. \nAn Airbus spokesman declined to comment, telling Reuters it was “the privilege of customers to make such announcements.” \nQatar Airways, which has a reputation as a demanding customer when reviewing aircraft for quality before delivery, has ordered 80 A350s, including smaller A350-900 jets, some of which are already operating in the airline’s fleet. \nThe A350-1000, the largest model, was launched to compete against Boeing’s 777s. \nBaker also said Qatar Airways was not interested “at the moment” in buying stakes in Air India and Pakistan International Airlines (PIA), which the government of India and government of Pakistan are separately trying to privatise. \nQatar Airways owns minority stakes in British Airways-parent International Consolidated Airlines Group, South America’s LATAM Airlines Group SA, Asia’s Cathay Pacific, and Italy’s Meridiana.
