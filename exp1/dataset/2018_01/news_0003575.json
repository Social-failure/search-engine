The decision also banned more than 100 opposition lawmakers from politics.\nThat prompted the European Union and the United States to withdraw their support of the 2018 election.\nCambodia will hold a general election on July 29. Hun Sen has vowed to extend his more than 30 years in power by at least another decade.\nKem Sokha said 2017 was marked by big political crises that led to a “democracy walked backward.”\nA spokesman from Hun Sen’s ruling party, Sok Eysan said there was little interest in Kem Sokha’s new year message, adding that opposition politicians could create a new party.\n“They have the political rights as citizens ... to create a new party to compete,” Sok Eysan told Reuters.\nReporting by Prak Chan Thul; Editing by Amy Sawitta Lefevre and Kim Coghill\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-01T07:19:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-01T08:13:02.010+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
