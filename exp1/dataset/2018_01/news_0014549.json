You are hereby notified that a securities class action lawsuit has been commenced in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York. To get more information go to:\nhttp://www.zlk.com/pslra-sbm-cc/atbcoin\nor contact Joseph E. Levi, Esq. either via email at jlevi@levikorsinsky.com or by telephone at (212) 363-7500, toll-free: (877) 363-5972. There is no cost or obligation to you.\nThe complaint alleges that ATBCOIN violated the Securities Act of 1933, by engaging in interstate commerce for the purposes of offering, selling, or delivering unregistered securities. The complaint alleges that ATB Coins constitute securities by virtue of defendants’ assertions in marketing and promotional materials that the ATB Coins were an “investment” that would generate “profit” for purchasers.\nIf you purchased ATB Coins pursuant to the ICO you have until March 12, 2018 to request that the Court appoint you as lead plaintiff. Your ability to share in any recovery doesn’t require that you serve as a lead plaintiff.\nLevi & Korsinsky is a national firm with offices in New York, California, Connecticut, and Washington D.C.
