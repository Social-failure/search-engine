Denis played better than me in the Montreal match, but today I broke him three times to love and that was the key.”\nDefending champion Sock lost 6-3 6-3 in only 61 minutes to his German opponent, who is ranked 65th in the world.\nThe Australian Open, the first grand slam of the year, runs from Jan. 15-28.\nReporting by Sudipto Ganguly in Mumbai; editing by Peter Rutherford\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-10T10:56:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-10T11:07:24.079+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
