Those courts take years to hear cases, thus delaying the completion of projects. \n“The direct consequence of this is a lengthening of the time it takes to complete a project -- seven to nine years on average -- compared to three to four years in Germany,” the government said in a statement regarding its new proposals. \nSome 70 percent of authorized projects are facing appeals in Administrative Tribunals courts, the government said, adding that its reforms would remove a level of jurisdiction in the appeals process.
