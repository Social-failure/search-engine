Until Saturday, that is, when a meeting between Sanders and his top political advisers explicitly discussed the possibility.\nOf course, this doesn't mean Sanders is definitely running — just that he talked to some top advisers about what would happen if he did.\nRead more from Vox:\n3 potential problems for an obstruction of justice case against Trump\nThe moment the judge in the Larry Nassar case crossed a line\n\"Voices, chaos in the background\": mom recalls Kentucky school shooting victim's last phone call\nBut half a dozen Democrats who spoke to Politico all acknowledged that while 2020 has been brought up with aides and associates before, this is the first time the campaign has officially been on the agenda or discussed in a group of this size and influence.\nPart of the conversation included a discussion of other possible candidates and strategies for how to beat them.

As Matthew Yglesias explained , Sanders could be considered the most popular politician in America. He's also \"Democrats' most in-demand public speaker, and the most prolific grassroots fundraiser in American history.\"\nSanders is currently beating Donald Trump in the polls. According to multiple Democrats, the senator hasn't yet made a decision about 2020 but thinks beating Trump is the most important thing for this country.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-25T23:27:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-26T00:10:19.018+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
