I just want to score as many runs as possible for Yorkshire and soak up as much as I can from the whole experience.”\nKnown for his defensive technique, Pujara went unsold in the recent auction for this year’s Indian Premier League (IPL) Twenty20 competition but bats at the important number three position in the test side.\nIndia will play five tests in England, starting at Edgbaston on Aug. 1.\nReporting by Amlan Chakraborty in New Delhi; Editing by John O'Brien\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-30T12:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-30T12:24:03.034+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
