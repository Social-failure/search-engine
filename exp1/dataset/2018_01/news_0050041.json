(the “Company”)(NYSE: BY), the parent company of Byline Bank (the “Bank”), today reported net loss of $766,000, or $0.03 per diluted share, for the fourth quarter of 2017, compared with net income of $9.8 million, or $0.32 per diluted share, for the third quarter of 2017, and net income of $63.9 million, or $2.62 per diluted share, for the fourth quarter of 2016. Fourth quarter 2017 financial results include $7.2 million, or $0.24 per diluted share, in expense related to the reduction in the value of the Company’s net deferred tax assets as a result of the decrease in the federal corporate tax rate and $1.3 million, or $0.04 per diluted share, in merger-related expense. Excluding these significant items, adjusted earnings were $7.3 million, or $0.24 per diluted share, for the fourth quarter of 2017.\n“Although the fourth quarter of 2017 included several significant items related to the tax law changes and merger-related expenses, we continued to see positive momentum in our new business development activity,” said Alberto J. Paracchini, President and Chief Executive Officer of Byline Bancorp, Inc. “Our total loans and leases increased at a 10.9% annualized rate in the quarter, driven by strong growth in our commercial real estate and commercial and industrial portfolios. Our Small Business Capital operations also had a strong quarter, with $132.3 million in closed loan commitments and more than $9.0 million net gain on the sale of loans.\n“We remain focused on executing our strategy of pursuing disciplined organic growth in 2018. Our pending acquisition of First Evanston Bancorp, Inc. will enable us to enter new markets in the greater Chicago metropolitan area, provide us with increased scale and allow us the opportunity to add a productive team of experienced commercial, retail and wealth management professionals. We are highly focused on completing the First Evanston acquisition and providing a smooth transition for our new customers and colleagues,” said Mr. Paracchini.\nSTATEMENTS OF OPERATIONS\nNet Interest Income\nThe following table presents net interest income for the periods indicated:\nThree Months Ended Year Ended December 31, September 30, June 30, March 31, December 31, December 31, (dollars in thousands) 2017 2017 2017 2017 2017 2016 INTEREST AND DIVIDEND INCOME\nInterest and fees on loans and leases\n$ 31,896 $ 30,933 $ 29,181 $ 28,396 $ 120,406 $ 83,150 Interest on taxable securities 3,679 3,720 3,703 3,790 14,892 14,169 Interest on tax-exempt securities 176 174 151 133 634 653 Other interest and dividend income\n205 217 280 169 871 393 Total interest and dividend income\n35,956 35,044 33,315 32,488 136,803 98,365 INTEREST EXPENSE Deposits 2,218 2,112 1,923 1,483 7,736 4,580 Federal Home Loan Bank advances 1,009 850 772 660 3,291 706 Subordinated debentures and other borrowings\n578 670 809 807 2,864 2,461 Total interest expense 3,805 3,632 3,504 2,950 13,891 7,747 Net interest income $ 32,151 $ 31,412 $ 29,811 $ 29,538 $ 122,912 $ 90,618 The following table presents the quarter-to-date schedule of average interest-earning assets and average interest-bearing liabilities for the periods indicated:\nFor the Three Months Ended December 31, September 30, 2017 2017 (dollars in thousands) Average Balance (5)\nInterest Inc / Exp\nAverage Yield /\nRate\nAverage Balance (5)\nInterest Inc / Exp\nAverage Yield /\nRate\nASSETS Cash and cash equivalents $ 38,908 $ 74 0.75 % $ 48,354 $ 106 0.87 % Loans and leases (1) 2,233,863 31,896 5.66 % 2,193,076 30,933 5.60 % Securities available-for-sale 588,482 3,166 2.13 % 602,146 3,181 2.10 % Securities held-to-maturity 106,367 644 2.40 % 111,345 650 2.32 % Tax exempt securities (2) 27,504 176 2.55 % 26,166 174 2.63 % Total interest-earning assets $ 2,995,124 $ 35,956 4.76 % $ 2,981,087 $ 35,044 4.66 % Allowance for loan and lease losses (16,844 ) (14,570 ) All other assets 325,393 340,669 TOTAL ASSETS $ 3,303,673 $ 3,307,186 LIABILITIES AND STOCKHOLDERS’ EQUITY\nDeposits Interest checking $ 188,457 $ 31 0.07 % $ 186,447 $ 29 0.06 % Money market accounts 384,864 344 0.35 % 388,365 275 0.28 % Savings 436,916 78 0.07 % 441,096 79 0.07 % Time deposits 709,044 1,765 0.99 % 758,518 1,729 0.90 % Total interest bearing deposits 1,719,281 2,218 0.51 % 1,774,426 2,112 0.47 % Federal Home Loan Bank advances 261,888 1,009 1.53 % 222,800 850 1.51 % Other borrowed funds 58,794 578 3.90 % 60,418 670 4.40 % Total borrowings 320,682 1,587 1.96 % 283,218 1,520 2.13 % Total interest-bearing liabilities $ 2,039,963 $ 3,805 0.74 % $ 2,057,644 $ 3,632 0.70 % Non-interest bearing demand deposits 767,985 748,523 Other liabilities 32,424 42,577 Total stockholders’ equity 463,301 458,442 TOTAL LIABILITIES AND STOCKHOLDERS’ EQUITY\n$ 3,303,673 $ 3,307,186 Net interest spread (3) 4.02 % 3.96 % Net interest income $ 32,151 $ 31,412 Net interest margin (4) 4.26 % 4.18 % Net loan accretion impact on margin $ 2,301 0.30 % $ 2,166 0.29 % Net interest margin excluding loan accretion (6)\n3.96 % 3.89 % (1) Loan and lease balances are net of deferred origination fees and costs and initial indirect costs.

Net interest income for the fourth quarter of 2017 was $32.2 million, an increase of $739,000 from $31.4 million for the third quarter of 2017.\nThe increase in net interest income was primarily due to:\nAn increase of $963,000 in interest and fees on loans and leases, primarily due to the growth in the originated loan and lease portfolio and the increase in average yield on loans and leases to 5.66% for the fourth quarter of 2017 compared to 5.60% for the third quarter of 2017; and A decrease of $92,000 in interest expense on other borrowings, primarily due to the repayment of the outstanding balance of $16.2 million under the Company’s line of credit during the third quarter of 2017.\nPartially offset by:\nAn increase of $159,000 in interest expense on Federal Home Loan Bank advances, primarily due to an increase in advances outstanding during the quarter; and An increase of $106,000 in interest expense on deposits, primarily due to higher rates on money market accounts and time deposits.\nNet interest margin for the fourth quarter of 2017 was 4.26%, an increase of 8 basis points from the third quarter of 2017. The net interest margin increase was primarily driven by the increased loan and lease volume and yields during the quarter. Total net loan accretion on acquired loans contributed 30 basis points to the net interest margin for the fourth quarter of 2017 and 29 basis points for the third quarter of 2017. Net interest margin excluding loan accretion expanded 7 basis points to 3.96% during the fourth quarter.\nThe cost of average total deposits was 0.35%, an increase of two basis points from the third quarter of 2017 due to slightly higher rates on interest bearing deposits, offset by growth in quarter-to-date average non-interest bearing demand deposits of $19.5 million.\nProvision for Loan and Lease Losses\nThe provision for loan and lease losses was $3.3 million for the fourth quarter of 2017, a decrease of $553,000 compared to $3.9 million for the third quarter of 2017. The fourth quarter provision included allocations of $1.9 million for acquired non-impaired loans, $806,000 for originated loans and leases and a $625,000 provision for acquired impaired loans. The lower provision for the fourth quarter of 2017 was mainly due to lower historical loss rates offset by additional growth in the loan and lease portfolio.\nNon-interest Income\nThe following table presents the components of non-interest income for the periods indicated:\nThree Months Ended Year Ended December 31, September 30, June 30, March 31, December 31, December 31, (dollars in thousands) 2017 2017 2017 2017 2017 2016 NON-INTEREST INCOME Fees and service charges on deposits\n$ 1,304 $ 1,418 $ 1,348 $ 1,219 $ 5,289 $ 5,665 Servicing fees 704 959 1,076 919 3,658 1,906 ATM and interchange fees 1,498 1,495 1,499 1,348 5,840 5,856 Net gains on sales of securities available-for-sale\n— — — 8 8 3,227 Net gains on sales of loans 9,036 7,499 8,445 8,082 33,062 4,323 Other non-interest income 97 547 825 732 2,201 4,927 Total non-interest income $ 12,639 $ 11,918 $ 13,193 $ 12,308 $ 50,058 $ 25,904 Non-interest income for the fourth quarter of 2017 was $12.6 million, an increase of $721,000 from $11.9 million for the third quarter of 2017, primarily due to:\nAn increase of $1.5 million in net gains on sales of loans; and A decrease of $255,000 in servicing fees, primarily due to the change in fair value of the servicing asset as a result of increases in prepayment speeds on government guaranteed loans.\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2017, the Company sold $87.9 million of government guaranteed loans compared to $71.8 million during the third quarter of 2017, contributing to the increase in net gains on sale of loans for the quarter.\nNon-interest Expense\nThe following table presents the components of non-interest expense for the periods indicated:\nThree Months Ended Year Ended December 31, September 30, June 30, March 31, December 31, December 31, (dollars in thousands) 2017 2017 2017 2017 2017 2016 NON-INTEREST EXPENSE Salaries and employee benefits $ 17,118 $ 16,323 $ 17,226 $ 16,602 $ 67,269 $ 50,585 Occupancy expense, net 3,553 3,301 3,485 3,739 14,078 14,330 Equipment expense 663 630 616 563 2,472 2,032 Loan and lease related expenses 1,116 891 801 877 3,685 2,004 Legal, audit and other professional fees 2,658 1,608 1,090 1,671 7,027 5,862 Data processing 2,284 2,399 2,447 2,409 9,539 8,157 Net (gain) loss recognized on other real estate owned and other related expenses\n(430 ) 565 141 (570 ) (294 ) 1,719 Regulatory assessments 299 326 384 184 1,193 2,553 Other intangible assets amortization expense 767 769 769 769 3,074 3,003 Advertising and promotions 232 196 318 289 1,035 623 Telecommunications 428 351 396 418 1,593 1,698 Other non-interest expense 1,670 3,706 1,576 1,900 8,852 8,120 Total non-interest expense $ 30,358 $ 31,065 $ 29,249 $ 28,851 $ 119,523 $ 100,686 Non-interest expense for the fourth quarter of 2017 was $30.4 million, a decrease of $707,000 from $31.1 million for the third quarter of 2017.\nThe decrease in total non-interest expense was primarily due to:\nA decrease of $2.0 million in other non-interest expense, primarily due to a $951,000 decrease in impairment charges on assets held for sale; and A decrease of $995,000 in net loss recognized on other real estate owned and other related expenses, primarily due to increased gains on sales of assets during the quarter and lower other real estate owned expenses; and A $409,000 decrease in provision for unfunded commitments, primarily due to the funding of outstanding commitments.\nPartially offset by:\nAn increase of $1.1 million in legal, audit and other professional fees, primarily due to professional services related to the First Evanston Bancorp, Inc. acquisition announced during the fourth quarter of 2017; and An increase of $795,000 in salaries and employee benefits, primarily due to higher commissions and additional salary and benefit expenses for new hires; and An increase of $252,000 in occupancy expense primarily due to a reduction in real estate tax expenses during the third quarter.\nThe Company’s efficiency ratio was 66.06% for the fourth quarter of 2017, compared with 69.92% for the third quarter of 2017.\nINCOME TAXES\nThe Company recorded income tax expense of $11.9 million during the fourth quarter of 2017 compared to a benefit of $1.4 million during the third quarter of 2017, an increase of $13.2 million. On December 22, 2017, President Donald Trump signed into law “H.R. 1”, commonly known as the “Tax Cuts and Jobs Act”. Among other items, the law reduced the federal corporate income tax rate to 21% effective January 1, 2018. As a result of the rate change, the Company’s net deferred tax assets were required to be revalued during the period in which the new legislation was enacted, and recorded net income tax expense of $7.2 million, or $0.24 per diluted share, during the fourth quarter as a result of this change. As a result of the new 21% corporate federal tax rate, the Company expects its effective tax rate for 2018 to be approximately 27% to 29%.\nAlso contributing to the increase in income tax expense in the current quarter, the Company recorded a state income tax benefit of $4.6 million, or $0.16 per diluted share, during the quarter ended September 30, 2017, as a result of increased value to the deferred tax asset related to the Company’s Illinois net loss deduction.

and A decrease in time deposits of $17.7 million, from $726.5 million at September 30, 2017 to $708.8 million at December 31, 2017.

Byline Bank has approximately $3.4 billion in assets and operates more than 50 full service branch locations throughout the Chicago and Milwaukee metropolitan areas.

These measures include non-interest income to total revenues, pre-tax pre-provision return on average assets, tangible book value per share and tangible common equity to tangible assets. Management believes that these non-GAAP financial measures provide useful information to management and investors that is supplementary to the Company’s financial condition, results of operations and cash flows computed in accordance with GAAP; however, management acknowledges that our non-GAAP financial measures have a number of limitations. As such, these disclosures should not be viewed as a substitute for results determined in accordance with GAAP financial measures that we and other companies use. Management also uses these measures for peer comparison. See “Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures” in the financial schedules included in this press release for a reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures to the comparable GAAP financial measures.\nAdjusted net income excludes significant items, which include the net deferred tax asset valuation reversal, incremental income tax benefit related to Illinois corporate income tax rate increase, incremental income tax expense related to federal corporate income tax reduction, impairment charges on assets held for sale, and merger related expense, adjusted for applicable income tax. Management believes the significant items are not indicative of or useful to measure the Company’s operating performance on an ongoing basis.\nNon-interest income to total revenues is non-interest income divided by net interest income plus non-interest income. Management believes that it is standard practice in the industry to present non-interest income as a percentage of total revenue. Accordingly, management believes providing these measures may be useful for peer comparison.\nPre-tax pre-provision return on average assets is pre-tax income plus the provision for loan and lease losses, divided by average assets. Management believes this metric is important due to the tax benefit resulting from the reversal of the net deferred tax asset valuation allowance, the decrease in the federal corporate income tax rate, and the increase in the Illinois state income tax rate. The ratio demonstrates profitability excluding the tax provision or benefit and excludes the provision for loan and lease losses.\nTangible book value per share is calculated as tangible common equity, which is stockholders’ equity reduced by preferred stock and goodwill and other intangible assets, divided by total shares of common stock outstanding. Management believes this metric is important due to the relative changes in the book value per share exclusive of changes in intangible assets.\nTangible common equity to tangible assets is calculated as tangible common equity divided by tangible assets, which is total assets reduced by goodwill and other intangible assets. Management believes this measure is important to investors and analysts interested in relative changes in the ratio of total stockholders’ equity to total assets, each exclusive of changes in intangible assets.\nForward-Looking Statements\nThis communication contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the U.S. federal securities laws.
