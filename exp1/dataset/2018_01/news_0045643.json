The Board will commence a formal process to appoint a new CEO.\n\"The Board gave this matter the deepest consideration and recognizes the many contributions Steve made over the past eleven years to achieve the global scale, reach and market leadership the company enjoys today. He has worked hard to grow and sustain the business, and we greatly appreciate his efforts,\" said Van Camp. \"I also want to emphasize that this action was not related to the company's operational performance or financial condition, both of which remain strong.
