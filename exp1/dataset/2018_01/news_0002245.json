But he also said it must include a border wall as well as measures to end chain migration and the current visa lottery program.\n“Hopefully, everything is going to work out very well,” Trump said. “If we have support from the Democrats, I think DACA is going to be terrific,” he added, referring to the law dealing with so-called Dreamers who came to the United States as undocumented children.\nRelated Coverage White House: Trump to host bipartisan meeting on immigration next week\nReporting by Steve Holland; Writing by David Alexander; Editing by Susan Heavey\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-04T19:29:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-04T19:44:52.005+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
