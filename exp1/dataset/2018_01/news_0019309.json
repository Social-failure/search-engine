Long may this continue”, said Accendo Markets analyst Mike van Dulken. \nTroubled building and services group Carillion plummeted 29 percent after a report that the company has put administrators on standby in case talks to rescue the debt-laden group fail. \nLikewise British ministers held crisis talks to discuss the fate of Carillion. \n“We suspect that given its mounting liabilities, recent press comment, growing customer worries and supply chain hesitancy that Carillion will be forced (by the banks) to accelerate its financial restructuring”, Peel Hunt analyst Andrew Nussey said. \nWhile Christmas updates weighed on Tesco and Marks and Spencer during the previous session, they both recovered slightly.
