(NASDAQ: CBSH) announced record earnings of $.86 per common share for the three months ended December 31, 2017 compared to $.65 per share in the same quarter last year and $.67 per share in the prior quarter. Net income attributable to Commerce Bancshares, Inc. for the fourth quarter amounted to $94.4 million, compared to $71.6 million in the fourth quarter of 2016 and $74.6 million in the prior quarter. There were several extraordinary items which occurred in the 4 th quarter, including a previously announced $25 million contribution of appreciated stock to the Commerce Bancshares Foundation and a one-time bonus to certain employees of approximately $3.3 million. These two items combined with adjustments for the new corporate tax legislation added $.12 per share for this period. For the quarter, the return on average assets was 1.50%, the return on average common equity was 14.2%, and the efficiency ratio was 67.9%.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017, earnings per common share totaled $2.89 compared to $2.49 in 2016, or an increase of 16.1%. Net income attributable to Commerce Bancshares, Inc. for the year ended December 31, 2017 increased 16.0% to $319.4 million compared to $275.4 million last year. For the current year, the return on average assets was 1.28%, and the return on average common equity was 12.5%.\nIn announcing these results, David W. Kemper, Chairman and CEO, said, “Core earnings were strong this quarter driven by growth in net interest income, higher fee income, solid expense control and continued low credit losses. Our net interest margin continued to expand, driven by increased rates on both our loan and investment portfolios, while deposit costs remained stable. We saw strong growth from both our trust and commercial card businesses, which increased 12.9% and 14.3%, respectively, over the same quarter in the prior year. Non-interest expense increased just 2.3% over the same quarter last year when adjusted for the one-time bonus and foundation contribution, as we continue to focus on expenses. This quarter total average loans increased $183.0 million, or 5.3% annualized over the prior quarter, driven by growth in construction, business, business real estate, consumer and consumer credit card lending activities.”\nMr. Kemper added, “Credit quality remains strong, and capital and liquidity levels continue to be among the best in the banking industry. For the current quarter, net loan charge-offs totaled $11.0 million, up slightly over the prior quarter. This small increase was due mainly to growth in net loan charge-offs in business loans, offset by lower automobile loan net charge-offs. The ratio of annualized net loan charge-offs to average loans was .32% this quarter compared to .31% last quarter. Non-performing assets decreased this quarter to $12.7 million, or a decline of $2.0 million from the prior quarter. During the current quarter, the provision for loan losses exceeded net loan charge-offs by $1.7 million, and the allowance for loan losses amounted to $159.5 million, or 1.14% of period end loans.”\nTotal assets at December 31, 2017 were $24.8 billion, total loans were $14.0 billion, and total deposits were $20.4 billion. During the fourth quarter of 2017, the Company distributed a 5% stock dividend on its common stock. This quarter the Company also paid an annualized 6% cash dividend on its preferred stock and a cash dividend of $.214 per common share, as restated for the 5% stock dividend.\nCommerce Bancshares, Inc. is a regional bank holding company offering a full range of financial products to consumers and commercial customers including personal banking, lending, mortgage banking, wealth management, brokerage and capital markets services.
