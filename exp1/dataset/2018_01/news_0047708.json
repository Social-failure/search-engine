REUTERS/Issei Kato \nIt was “red raw” he told reporters, and pain killing injections had provided no relief. \nChung made clear he was not interested in grinding through, however, fearing fans would be disaffected by a poor show. \n“Many things come together because I retired in (the) semis,” he said. \n”But I think I did (the) right thing. If I play (a) bad thing on the court, it’s not good for the fans and audience as well. \n“I‘m happy to be able to make the semis in a grand slam. I want to be stronger next year.” \nChung can certainly hope to fulfil those expectations after a giddy fortnight that included demolishing an injury-hampered Djokovic in three sets and a brilliant win over fourth seed Alexander Zverev, who many had regarded as the strongest young contender in the draw. \nChung said he had already attained some of his goals by becoming South Korea’s top ranked player and achieving his best showing in a grand slam. \n“I really didn’t know I‘m going to make it in semis,” Chung added. “Next goal is I want to finish the season without injury.” Editing by Jon Boyle", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-26T13:42:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-26T13:58:00.017+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
