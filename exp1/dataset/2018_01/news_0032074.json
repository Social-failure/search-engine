However, it was not immediately clear if the numbers were comparable. \nAdjusted net interest revenue rose 2.25 percent to $862 million, benefiting from the three hikes in benchmark interest rate by the Federal Reserve in 2017. BNY Mellon’s non-interest expenses rose 14.25 percent to $3 billion. \nOn an adjusted basis, the bank’s total revenue fell 1.8 percent to $3.72 billion. \nThe company’s assets under custody and administration rose 3.42 percent sequentially to $33.3 trillion as of Dec.31. \nShares of BNY Mellon were up nearly 2 percent at $57.89 in premarket trading.
