Locomotive engineer Tom Harding, 56, operations manager Jean Demaître, 53, and rail traffic controller Richard Labrie, 59, face charges of criminal negligence causing death in the crude-by-rail disaster.\nThe three worked for the now-defunct Montreal Maine & Atlantic railway which operated the runaway train, according to court documents.\nAll three pleaded not guilty and did not testify during the trial in Sherbrooke, Quebec.
