Qualcomm rejected the $103 billion deal, saying it devalued the company.\nIn December Broadcom nominated its first slate of replacement board members who were later rejected by Qualcomm, setting the stage for a bitter proxy battle. \nNomura said a Broadcom bid is \"the most attractive long-term option for Qualcomm shareholders\" but predicted several short-term bumps including a strong earnings report and the closure of the NXP Semiconductors deal. \nQualcomm rose 2 percent in morning trading Tuesday. \nDisclaimer", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-16T16:51:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-16T16:51:30.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
