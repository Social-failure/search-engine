Absolutely,” Morgan said.\nFILE PHOTO: A Chinese flag is seen in front of the financial district of Pudong in Shanghai, China, January 19, 2016. REUTERS/Aly Song/File Photo - RC18D15B05C0 NO STRINGS ATTACHED Von Amsberg, who spent some 25 years at the World Bank before joining the AIIB in 2016, said the lender with 84 member nations held itself to high standards on environmental, social and governance norms, and denied it weakened civil society.\nIn response to a question from Reuters, Chinese foreign ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying told a briefing in Beijing: “The Chinese government has always asked companies that are going out to carry out operations in their host countries under a legal framework in accordance with the law and rules, and to positively fulfill their responsibility to society.”\nSome sovereign governments welcome assistance without a broader agenda. Bangladesh, for example, struck deals with China for billions of dollars worth of loans for various projects when President Xi Jinping visited in late 2016.\n“Anybody would prefer Chinese investment if the alternative is the World Bank,” Moshiur Rahman, economic adviser to Bangladesh’s prime minister, told Reuters in an interview in Dhaka this month.\n“Unlike Western investors, they are not worried about how many people you put in jail.”\nCOMMON GROUND Some non-profits are looking for common ground to find areas that they can work on.\nThe Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation has been working with Beijing on projects for more than a decade, and taking Chinese expertise in areas such as agriculture to other parts of Asia and Africa, said Mark Suzman, chief strategy officer for the foundation.\nSuzman said the foundation was in discussions to see if Belt and Road projects in Southeast Asia could be used to work on malaria prevention in the Mekong delta, a disease where the Chinese have expertise.\n“We actually feel pretty optimistic that there is a win-win potential to it,” Suzman said.\nLast month the Chinese government circulated an article to the United Nations about its approach to human rights, laying out how Beijing was turning its “domestic governance philosophies into international consensus”.\n“Peace and security are the most important human rights,” wrote Li Baodong, vice minister for foreign affairs. “Development is of paramount importance.”\n“We have made fresh headway in increasing our say on human rights issues,” he wrote.\nAdditional reporting by Krishna Das in Dhaka and Ben Blanchard in Beijing; Editing by Mark Bendeich\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-01-26T20:22:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-27T00:13:15.014+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
