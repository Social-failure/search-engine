Slideshow (5 Images) \nMateo Kovacic blasted Real’s best chance wide before halftime and goalkeeper Kiko Casilla swatted away a Claudio Beauvue volley to deny Leganes shortly before Spain international Asensio met Theo Hernandez’s cross at the near post and buried it low in the bottom corner. \n“We can’t say that we played very well but we got a result which is very important to our chances of winning the tie,” Zidane told reporters. \n“We now need to go on a winning run, we have to be patient and believe that we can do it if we all pull together. This win is a chance for us to string two, three or four wins together.” \nThe second leg at the Santiago Bernabeu is on Jan. 24.
