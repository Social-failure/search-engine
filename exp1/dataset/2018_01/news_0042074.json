The rules require them to file reports on suspicious financial activity.\nBut many other countries have no such requirements.\nBitcoin BTC=BTSP soared more than 1,700 percent last year to a record high, raising fears that the volatile emerging asset poses a risk to investors and the global financial system.\nRegulators have also warned of risks that criminals may use the virtual currencies to store and transmit their ill-gotten gains, because they can be used anonymously.\nSeveral countries including South Korea and China have tried to slow trading of cryptocurrencies, and fears of a wider clampdown pushed bitcoin down nearly 20 percent last week.\nPolicymakers around the world are debating how to deal with the volatility of cryptocurrencies. A senior Bank of Japan official said on Thursday that imposing global, across-the-board regulations on their trading won’t be easy.\nChristine Lagarde, head of the International Monetary Fund, said countries should take into account both the risks and benefits associated with the development of the cryptocurrencies in deciding whether and how to regulate the market.\n“The anonymity and lack of transparency and the way in which it conceals and protects money laundering and financing of terrorism, is just unacceptable. It needs to be taken into account but then there will be innovations coming out of these movements,” Lagarde told the Davos forum.\nLarry Fink, chief executive of BlackRock Inc, the world’s biggest asset manager, told the forum that cryptocurrencies posed a systemic threat that needed to be dealt with globally.\nHe said they might be something he considered investing in but the crypto currency industry was “more an index of money laundering”.\nReporting by Simon Robinson and Soyoung Kim in DAVOS; Editing by Mark Bendeich\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-25T15:14:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-25T15:59:51.011+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
