But growth in the year to the end of November slowed to 11.6 percent from 11.8 percent in October.\nOn the month, house prices rose by 1.1 percent, after a 0.4 percent rise in October.\nA long-standing lack of supply combined with surging demand has boosted prices. Still, prices are now 23 percent below the peak hit at the height of a property bubble a decade ago.
