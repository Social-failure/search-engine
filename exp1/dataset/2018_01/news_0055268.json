The community bank holding company reported a nonrecurring tax expense adjustment while reaffirming its ongoing quarterly cash dividend.\nPresident and CEO John Dalby stated, “The Board of Directors and management team are pleased with the company’s financial and operating performance for 2017. Redwood Capital Bank’s service-first and solutions-oriented approach to banking enabled us to further expand existing client relationships and forge new ones. Throughout 2017, we continued to move the company forward by organically growing loans and deposits, while strengthening the core mission of re-investing in our local community.”\nTotal assets as of December 31, 2017 were $342.2 million, a decrease of 9% over the September 30, 2017 figure and a modest increase of 3% over the December 31, 2016 reported figures. Total deposits stood at $311.7 million as of December 31, 2017, 9% less than the September 30, 2017 figures and 3% higher than the December 31, 2016 numbers. The company again reported loan growth for the year while loans shrank slightly in the fourth quarter. Total loans as of December 31, 2017, net of unearned income, were $255.2 million, a slight decrease of 1% from the prior quarter and an increase of 4% over the year ended December 31, 2016.\nConsolidated net income before taxes for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2017 totaled $1,477,000 and $5,031,000, up 9% from the figure reported for the three months ended September 30, 2017 and up a stout 12% from the figure reported for the twelve months ended December 31, 2016. The company also reported net income for the fourth quarter of 2017 of $403,000, while net income for the year ended December 31, 2017 was reported as $2,565,000. The earnings represented a 50% decrease over the September 30, 2017 quarter and a slight decrease of 5% from the year ended December 31, 2016. The decrease was associated with a one-time non-cash charge to income tax expense of approximately $460,000 in the fourth quarter as the company revalued its deferred tax assets in preparation for lower federal income tax rates moving forward . The strong performance in net income before taxes during the fourth quarter and full year are attributed to consistent, high quality loan growth, outstanding Fannie Mae (FNMA) loan originations, and strong cost controls.\nAdditionally, the Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $.065 per share, payable on February 12, 2018 to shareholders of record at the close of business on January 30, 2018. The dividend is equivalent to an annual rate of $0.26 per share or 1.43%, based upon a market price of $17.43 per common share. Since February 1, 2017 the rise in the company’s stock price, combined with dividends, has generated a total return of 17.8%.\nCEO Dalby explained, “We are delighted to announce a continued dividend as a sign the financial strength of the company. We remain confident in our ability to sustain shareholder value and serve the Humboldt County marketplace.”\nFor more information regarding Redwood Capital Bancorp, please visit our website at www.redwoodcapitalbank.com , contact Fred Moore, CFO, at (707) 444-9840, or stop by our headquarters and main office at 402 “G” Street, Eureka, CA 95501.\nThis press release may contain forward-looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties.
