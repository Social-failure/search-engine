It has also emboldened armed rebel groups in different parts of the country. \nIn the statement, France called for the proportionate use of force in the maintenance of law and order. \nThe instability has stoked fears that the vast, mineral-rich Democratic Republic of Congo could slide back into the wars that killed millions in the 1990s, mostly from hunger and disease.
