And I think the car and service are two different things so we have to bring much more fidelity into our system and we are very, very early on that path,\" he said.\nKhosrowshahi, who joined the pioneer of ride-hailing services last August, has pledged to make a clean break with the U.S. company's past practices. The San Francisco firm is recovering from a massive data breach, regulatory scrutiny and a damaging workplace culture report.\nUber's range of different ride-hailing services are active in more than 80 countries and almost 700 cities, the company claims, though Khosrowshahi has been hamstrung by the ongoing fallout from decisions taken by his predecessor and the firm's co-founder, Travis Kalanick.\nshow chapters Leaks have been positive for Uber, CEO says 7 Hours Ago | 00:48 On Thursday, Softbank completed its long-awaited investment agreement with Uber in a deal which unites one of the world's most ambitious tech funds with one of the most valuable start-ups.", "external_links": ["https://www.facebook.com/cnbcinternational", "https://twitter.com/cnbci"], "published": "2018-01-23T12:37:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-23T11:46:36.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
