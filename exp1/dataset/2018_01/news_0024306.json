Eskom did not respond to request for comment.\n“Eskom’s listed debt securities and registration of their programme memorandum may be suspended in accordance with the provisions of the JSE’s Debt Listings Requirements,” the JSE said in a statement.\n“Trading can still take place pending the JSE’s decision on whether it will suspend or not in accordance with the Debt Listings Requirements.” (Reporting by Joe Brock; Editing by Catherine Evans)\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-01-15T17:59:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-16T13:25:42.005+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
