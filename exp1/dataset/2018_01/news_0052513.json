REUTERS/Jean-Paul Pelissier Britain has had success cracking down on the problem by banning travel for known troublemakers - nearly 2,000 people are currently banned - and giving police the power to confiscate their passports.\nNot one British national was arrested for soccer-related disorder at tournaments in South Africa in 2010, Poland and Ukraine in 2012 or Brazil in 2014.\nThe trouble in Marseilles two years ago reignited concerns that English soccer violence could return, however.\nSlideshow (2 Images) “I think they (the Russians) are wary as every host nation is,” Roberts said.\nWhile an estimated half a million British fans traveled to France in 2016 only about 10,000-20,000 fans were expected to make the trip to Russia, however, he said.\nEnglish fans should not misbehave in Russia and should expect serious consequences if they do, he said.\n“There is a tendency when English supporters travel abroad to try to push the buttons of the local people. My perception is that sort of attempt to press the buttons in Russia would be really dimly viewed,” Roberts said.\n“If people were to get drunk and behave in a way that was perceived locally as being disrespectful to the hosts, that could provoke an adverse reaction. I really would make the point to supporters traveling that there will be a robust police response.”\nEditing by Guy Faulconbridge and Sonya Hepinstall\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-29T17:41:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-29T17:57:21.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
