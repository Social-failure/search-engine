We have likewise ceased all manufacturing in the associated cream cheese facility,” CEO Blaine Hurst said in a Sunday statement. \nWATCH THIS: Goop’s Guide to Eating Fast Food and Still Looking Like Gwyneth Paltrow \nIf you bought the cream cheese, Panera said, you should throw it away and call the company on 1-855-6-PANERA, or visit its customer help website , for information about how to claim a full refund.
