Tariffs are scheduled to be eliminated by 2019 under the free trade deal.\nAustralia’s quarter-share of the Chinese wine market is still only a little more than half that of France‘s.\nFILE PHOTO: A group of Kangaroos can be seen between rows of vines at the Charles Melton vineyard located in the Barossa Valley, north of Adelaide in Australia, June 10, 2017.

REUTERS/David Gray/File Photo But the cracking pace of China sales is benefiting major exporters such as Treasury, the world’s biggest standalone winemaker, which reported a 55 percent profit rise last August as Asia sales surged.\nTreasury declined to comment on Tuesday ahead of its Feb. 15 earnings announcement. Its shares rose as much as 4.8 percent in morning trade to A$16.70, while the broader market added 0.7 percent.\nThe boom has also lured Chinese producers to look at Australian terroir, with the purchase last month of a majority stake in Clare Valley vineyard Kilikanoon by Yantai Changyu Pioneer Wine Co Ltd ( 000869.SZ ) for $15.5 million, following several smaller deals in recent years.\nSales to the next top export markets behind China, the U.S. and Britain each fell 2 percent. Sales to Canada, where restrictions on foreign sales last week prompted an Australian complaint to the World Trade Organisation, fell 3 percent.\nIn volume terms, Australia’s total exports grew 8 percent to a record 811 million litres, even as 2017 worldwide production was expected fell to its lowest since 1961.\nNineteen percent of Australia’s wine by volume was sold in China. The fastest-growing segment of the export market was for expensive wine valued at more than A$200 per bottle.\n($1 = 1.2477 Australian dollars)\nReporting by Tom Westbrook; editing by Richard Pullin\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-01-23T09:12:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-23T07:18:51.003+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
