That compared with a 19.54 billion rupees average forecast from 24 analysts, Thomson Reuters data shows.\nSoured loans have nearly doubled at Indian banks over the past four years as a prolonged economic slowdown took its toll on the ability of companies to repay debt. The rise in non-performing loans has also been blamed on profligate lending in some cases.\nWhile 21 state-run lenders account for bulk of the 9.46 trillion rupees of stressed loans at Sept. 30, private sector banks including ICICI also had more than a trillion rupees of non-performing and rolled-over debt.\nICICI’s gross bad loans as a percentage of total loans was 7.82 percent at the end of December, compared with 7.87 percent at Sept. 30 and 7.2 percent a year earlier.\nGrowth in bad loans slowed to 43.8 billion rupees in the past quarter, from 46.74 billion rupees in the September quarter. That compared with 70.37 billion rupees a year ago.\nChief Executive Chanda Kochhar told reporters on a conference call that bad-loan additions were at their slowest in nine quarters but forecast provisions for such loans to remain at an “elevated” level as banks set aside more money for defaults by companies being pursued in bankruptcy court.\nProvisions including for bad loans rose by 31.6 percent from a year earlier to 35.7 billion rupees in the quarter, the bank said.\nKochhar also said the bank did not need to disclose any additional bad loans for the last financial year to March 2017 after a central bank audit of its books. She did not give details of the audit but said it was below the threshold set by the Reserve Bank of India for banks to report so-called divergence in bad loans.\nState-run IDBI Bank, which also reported third-quarter results on Wednesday, posted a fifth straight quarterly loss on higher provisions for bad loans, though the loss narrowed from last year.\n($1 = 63.6000 Indian rupees)\nReporting by Krishna V Kurup and Devidutta Tripathy; Editing by David Goodman\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-31T13:13:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-31T13:34:22.016+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
