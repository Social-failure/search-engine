That is my responsibility, how I take my job,” Pochettino said when asked about a potential move to Spain on Thursday. \n“But I am realistic... in England from the beginning of the season and today, there’s many changes on the Premier League benches. Then it’s not only you. It’s about the results, ideas, it’s the chairman, he can change and say ‘come on, out’.” \nPochettino, who played for Espanyol before managing them from 2009-12, did, however, rule out taking over the manager’s job at their city rivals Barcelona as well as Tottenham’s rivals Arsenal should those positions become available. \n”But tomorrow (Tottenham chairman) Daniel Levy could have a bad night and say, ‘Oh I am going to sack Mauricio’. Then I look stupid saying I am not going to work in one place or another. \n“You never know in football. That is the problem. It is a very unstable situation.” Reporting by Shrivathsa Sridhar in Bengaluru; Editing by John O'Brien", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-26T08:39:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-26T08:54:00.002+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
