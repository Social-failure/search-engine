It also plans to invest into a 10 MW power plant in Nepal, 1.4 MW and 2.5 MW hydro power plants in Sri Lanka. \nShares of LVL Energy Fund rose as much as 10 percent, before ending up 2 percent at 10.10 rupees a share, compared with the offer price of 10 rupees. $1 = 153.7000 Sri Lankan rupees Reporting by Ranga Sirilal; Editing by Shihar Aneez and Sherry Jacob-Phillips", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-09T13:16:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-09T13:49:04.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
