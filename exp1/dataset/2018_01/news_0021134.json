India's Virat Kohli plays a shot. REUTERS/James Oatway India trail South Africa by 152 runs having bowled their hosts out for 335 just before lunch on a slow wicket that has bounce, but little lateral movement.\nKohli will resume his innings on 85 not out along with all-rounder Hardik Pandya (11 not out) as the pair seek to eke out a first innings lead in the knowledge that batting last on a wicket already showing variable bounce will be a challenge.\nIndia have tried to be positive with the bat, but have lost wickets at regular intervals, with the top seven so far failing to provide support for Kohli.\nThe openers took the score to 28 before losing their first wicket when Lokesh Rahul (10) was caught and bowled by Morne Morkel, misjudging a delivery that held up on the surface.\nThey lost another wicket on the next ball when new batsman Cheteshwar Pujara took on the arm of Ngidi at mid-on and lost, run out by a direct hit.\nCricket - India v South Africa - Second Test match - Centurion Stadium, Pretoria, South Africa - January 14, 2018.
