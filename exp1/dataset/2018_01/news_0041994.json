We have not made any mistake on that last ‘no show’. I was at home and the controllers could not join me. It was a big misunderstanding,” Cornet told . \n“That’s why I am really hopeful that this third ‘no show’ will help me be cleared because it was not my fault.” \nThree missed tests in a 12-month period can lead to a suspension. \n“I have always been clean. My position on doping is clear. The cheats should be heavily sanctioned. In the last 10 years, I’ve had about 100 tests, all negative,” said Cornet. \n“I can look myself in the mirror. I am scared that I might get a suspension that would not be deserved. I feel like my career is in the hands of a jury and I hope they will understand my story.” (Reporting by Julien Pretot; Editing by Ken Ferris)", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-25T22:58:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-25T23:39:59.033+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
