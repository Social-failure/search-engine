In recent years, homicides have increased significantly more in the countryâ€™s northeast area than in the rest of the nation.\nReporting by Brad Brooks; Editing by Lisa Von Ahn\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-27T19:09:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-27T19:24:02.026+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
