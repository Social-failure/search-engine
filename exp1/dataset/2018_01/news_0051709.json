The company announced in November plans to begin giving rides to select residents as part of a public trial. \nOn Tuesday, Waymo said it expects to open the ride-hailing service to the general public in the Phoenix area this year as a commercial service. During a demonstration in October , the minivans had screens welcoming customers aboard and instructing them to push a blue “start ride” button on the ceiling. The vans otherwise seem like any other, except for its empty front seats. \n“With the world’s first fleet of fully self-driving vehicles on the road, we’ve moved from research and development, to operations and deployment,” John Krafcik, Waymo’s chief executive, said in a statement.\nWaymo is facing increasing pressure from auto makers and other tech companies to commercialize the fast-developing technology. \nGeneral Motors Co. , the largest U.S. auto maker by sales, has said it aims to run a large-scale fleet of driverless cars in big cities in 2019 while Volvo Cars said in November it has an agreement to supply ride-hailing firm Uber Technologies Inc. with a fleet of 24,000 self-driving vehicles beginning in 2019. \nWrite to Tim Higgins at Tim.Higgins@WSJ.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-30T07:01:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-30T08:09:31.004+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
