Novak Djokovic of Serbia serves during a practice session before the Australian Open tennis tournament. REUTERS/Issei Kato Djokovic, seeded 14th, will be hoping he can make a start on a similarly successful return when he takes on American Donald Young but admits to being uncertain how the elbow which forced an end to his season after last year’s Wimbledon will hold up.\n“If he’s back playing you hope he’s 100 percent or close to 100 percent, but you never know where the confidence is,” three-times Melbourne champion Mats Wilander told Reuters.\n“We don’t know where he is physically. But he has to be 100 percent ready emotionally, not just physically, to have a chance to win the title.”\nSwiss Wawrinka admitted he was not yet free of pain from the knee injury which has also kept him out of action since Wimbledon ahead of his match against unseeded Lithuanian Ricardas Berankis.\nWhile Halep’s match against local wildcard Destanee Aiava is also on the main showcourt, it is fair to say that Sharapova’s clash with Germany’s Tatjana Maria is probably the more intriguing match up, if only for how the crowd receives her.\nSharapova failed the dope test after her quarter-final loss to Serena Williams here two years ago and although her 15-month ban has done little to dim her appeal to tournament organizers, Melbourne fans might not be so forgiving.\nReporting by Nick Mulvenney; Editing by John O'Brien\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-15T16:21:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-15T16:43:29.014+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
