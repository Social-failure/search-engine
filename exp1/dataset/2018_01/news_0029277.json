Given that backdrop, Peter Smith, CEO of Blockchain, said it's better to start with just offering a sell service as it helps to control the launch in the U.S. and make sure people have a good experience.\n\"If we are prioritizing short-term gains, we would prioritize buy â€” that is what most people have done. But it's really time to make sure we nail that experience,\" Smith told CNBC in an interview ahead of the launch announcement.\nThe launch followed a huge sell-off in major cryptocurrencies that began Tuesday. The market appeared to stabilize on Thursday, however.\nBlockchain claims to have 22 million users and Smith said that it has 1 million daily users. Thirty percent to 40 percent of those are in the U.S., Smith added. In comparison, Coinbase, which has seen a surge in sign-ups to its platform in recent months, has over 10 million users, according to its website. Coinbase allows people to buy and sell bitcoin, ethereum and bitcoin cash.\nSmith said that \"in a few weeks\" Blockchain will add other cryptocurrencies to its platform to buy and sell.\nCryptocurrencies have divided opinion among business leaders and experts. J.P. Morgan CEO Jamie Dimon famously called bitcoin a \"fraud\", while noted investor Warren Buffett told CNBC that cryptocurrencies will \"come to a bad ending.\"\nBut others have said bitcoin will continue to climb this year. Julian Hosp, co-founder of TenX, a firm that wants to make it easier for people to spend virtual currencies, told CNBC in December that bitcoin could hit $60,000 in 2018, but could crash first. And Dave Chapman, managing director of cryptocurrency trading firm Octagon Strategy, said that bitcoin could hit $100,000 in 2018 .\nBlockchain's Smith did not give a price call on bitcoin, but said that it's likely the cryptocurrency's dominance, which is already on the decline , could continue to fall.\n\"What could happen this year is that I think we will see the dominance of bitcoin as a percentage of the market capitalization go down. That could be because other digital coins get strong, or that there are a lot more that are interesting,\" he said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-18T17:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-18T17:26:03.005+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
