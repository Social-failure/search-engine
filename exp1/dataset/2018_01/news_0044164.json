Instead, the streak ended at four. Neuvirth made 17 saves.\nTrailing 3-0, the Flyers attempted to get on the board with a power play early in the third period. Wayne Simmonds and Sean Couturier each had solid chances on rebounds in front, but Vasilevskiy was able to cover up the puck.\nThen with 9:30 remaining, Claude Giroux redirected a shot in front only to be denied by Vasilevskiy, who was completely sprawled out on the ice.\nIn a bit of a bizarre move, the Flyers pulled Neuvirth with 7:20 left.\nThe unorthodox decision paid off as Konecny scored with 6:42 remaining, the fourth straight game he has put the puck in the net.\nThe Lightning, however, struck back 47 seconds later with Namestnikov scoring for a 4-1 lead.\nAfter a scoreless first period in which Tampa Bay managed only three shots, the Lightning came out much more aggressive and scored three times on 10 shots in the second.\nJust 25 seconds in, Point notched his 20th goal of the season for a 1-0 lead. At 9:56, Gourde registered his 17th goal for two-goal advantage. Gourde has now scored in three straight games.\nCallahan gave the Lightning a 3-0 lead with a nifty set of moves for a short-handed goal at 17:29, snapping a 28-game goalless streak. The Flyers have allowed eight short-handed goals this season, which is the same amount the Lightning have scored.\n--Field Level Media\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-01-26T11:02:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-26T21:36:52.034+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
