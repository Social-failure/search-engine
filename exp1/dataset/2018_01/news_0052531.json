REUTERS/China Daily The national parliament opens in March, and provinces are now selecting their delegates to it.\nIt is unclear what new role Wang could be given, though leadership sources and diplomats say he might become the country’s new vice president, with a possible focus on relations with the United States.\nThe State Council Information Office, which doubles as the party spokesman’s office, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\nWang, who keeps a low public profile but is often described as China’s second most powerful politician, has not been totally out of the limelight since the end of the congress, for example, attending a banquet Xi hosted for U.S. President Donald Trump in November.\nWang was at the forefront of Xi’s anti-corruption push launched some five years ago as head of the party’s graft fighting Central Commission for Discipline Inspection, which has been responsible for jailing dozens of top officials.\nHe has a strong economic background also, previously serving as a vice governor of the central bank, and, as a vice premier with an economic portfolio, helped oversee China’s recovery from the 2008 global financial crisis.\nWang has experience managing relations with the United States too, heading the China delegation for the economic track at the once annual U.S.-China Strategic and Economic Dialogue.\nReporting by Ben Blanchard and Christian Shepherd; Editing by Clarence Fernandez\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-29T13:33:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-29T13:47:24.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
