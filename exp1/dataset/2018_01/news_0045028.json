(NASDAQ: RBCAA), headquartered in Louisville, Kentucky, is the holding company of Republic Bank & Trust Company (the “Bank”).\nRepublic Bancorp, Inc. (“Republic” or the “Company”) is pleased to report pre-tax earnings of $16.6 million for the fourth quarter of 2017, an 11% increase from the same period in 2016. The Company’s fourth quarter 2017 net income and Diluted Earnings per Class A Common Share both decreased 52% to $4.8 million and $0.23, with comparability to the prior period of both key metrics significantly impacted by a $6.3 million charge to income tax expense upon remeasurement of the Company’s net deferred tax assets (“DTAs”) (1) precipitated by tax reform and common among financial institutions. Without this charge, net income and Diluted Earnings per Class A Common Share for the fourth quarter of 2017 would have been $11.2 million and $0.53, with these non-GAAP (2) metrics representing increases of 12% and 10% over the fourth quarter of 2016.\nAs it relates to the Company’s charge to income tax expense upon remeasurement of its net DTAs during the quarter, on December 22, 2017, President Donald Trump signed into law the “Tax Cuts and Jobs Act” (the “TCJA”). The TCJA, among other things, reduces the federal corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%, effective January 1, 2018. As a result of the reduced tax rate, Republic and many other financial institutions incurred charges to income tax expense representing the decrease in the value of their net DTAs. In general, net DTAs represent the future benefits of tax deductions that the Company has recognized in a current or prior period for its GAAP-based financial statements, as compared to what it expects to record in the future for its income tax returns when those deductions can be realized for tax purposes.\nFiscal year 2017 net income was $45.6 million, a less than 1% decrease from fiscal 2016, resulting in Diluted Earnings per Class A Common Share of $2.20. As with the comparability between the fourth quarters of 2017 and 2016, comparability between the fiscal years of 2017 and 2016 was also significantly impacted by the TCJA-driven charge to income tax expense of $6.3 million as mentioned above. Excluding the impact of this charge, net income for 2017 would have been $52.0 million with Diluted Earnings per Class A Common Share of $2.50, with both of these non-GAAP metrics representing an increase of 13% over 2016.\nSteve Trager , Chairman & Chief Executive Officer of Republic, commented, “Before addressing tax reform, let me say that I am very excited to see solid growth in our pre-tax earnings from the same quarter a year ago. Largely driven by loan growth and complemented by expansion in our net interest margin, our top-line revenue for the fourth quarter of 2017 increased a strong $9.0 million, or 22%, over the same period in 2016. Furthermore, credit quality metrics within our Core Banking (3) operations continue to remain quite strong from period to period. On the other side of the ledger, I am thrilled about our $272 million, or 9%, growth in deposits during 2017, with $195 million of that growth representing ‘core deposits’ (4) . We set deposit growth as one of our main goals for 2017, and I would like to acknowledge the entire Republic team for their efforts in this growth.\n“Regarding tax reform, while the new law had a negative impact on the net income and the carrying value of the net DTAs of most financial institutions during the fourth quarter, including Republic, we embrace the benefits of the reduced federal tax rate in the years to come. While there remains a level of uncertainty regarding how this new law will impact consumer behavior and the many products and services that we offer, we are optimistic that over the long term it will provide us more flexibility in attracting new clients and new associates, while at the same time providing a greater return to our shareholders,” concluded Steve Trager.\nThe following table presents Republic’s financial performance in accordance with GAAP for the fourth quarters and years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, along with adjusted non-GAAP performance and a reconciliation to GAAP for the impact of the previously mentioned charge to income tax expense during the fourth quarter of 2017. The non-GAAP presentation and the reconciliation to GAAP are presented to allow appropriate comparability between the reported periods and to illustrate the impact of the TCJA-driven charge to income tax expense on the Company’s financial performance.\n(dollars in thousands, except per share data) Financial Performance Highlights Three Months Ended Dec. 31, $ % Years Ended Dec. 31, $ % 2017 2016 Change Change 2017 2016 Change Change TOTAL COMPANY: Income before income tax expense - GAAP* $ 16,612 $ 14,960 $ 1,652 11 % $ 78,386 $ 68,963 $ 9,423 14 % Net income: Net income - GAAP* $ 4,838 $ 10,000 $ (5,162 ) (52 )% $ 45,632 $ 45,903 $ (271 ) (1 )% Impact of TCJA(1)* 6,326 — 6,326 NM 6,326 — 6,326 NM Adjusted net income - Non-GAAP $ 11,164 $ 10,000 $ 1,164 12 $ 51,958 $ 45,903 $ 6,055 13 Diluted earnings per share (“EPS”) of Class A Common Stock:\nDiluted EPS of Class A Common Stock - GAAP $ 0.23 $ 0.48 $ (0.25 ) (52 )% $ 2.20 $ 2.22 $ (0.02 ) (1 )% Impact of TCJA 0.30 — 0.30 NM 0.30 — 0.30 NM Adjusted diluted EPS of Class A Common Stock - Non-GAAP $ 0.53 $ 0.48 $ 0.05 10 $ 2.50 $ 2.22 $ 0.28 13 Return on average assets (“ROA”):\nROA - GAAP 0.39 % 0.87 % NA (55 )% 0.95 % 1.02 % NA (7 )% Impact of TCJA 0.51 — NA NM 0.13 — NA NM Adjusted ROA - Non-GAAP 0.90 0.87 NA 3 1.08 1.02 NA 6 Return on average equity (“ROE”):\nROE - GAAP 3.02 % 6.62 % NA (54 )% 7.26 % 7.68 % NA (5 )% Impact of TCJA 3.95 — NA NM 1.01 — NA NM Adjusted ROE - Non-GAAP 6.97 6.62 NA 5 8.27 7.68 NA 8 CORE BANK(3): Income before income tax expense $ 17,105 $ 14,869 $ 2,236 15 % $ 56,545 $ 51,636 $ 4,909 10 % Net income: Net income - GAAP $ 6,883 $ 9,939 $ (3,056 ) (31 )% $ 33,448 $ 34,859 $ (1,411 ) (4 )% Impact of TCJA 4,594 — 4,594 NM 4,594 — 4,594 NM Adjusted net income - Non-GAAP $ 11,477 $ 9,939 $ 1,538 15 $ 38,042 $ 34,859 $ 3,183 9 REPUBLIC PROCESSING GROUP(5): Income (loss) before income tax expense $ (493 ) $ 91 $ (584 ) NM $ 21,841 $ 17,327 $ 4,514 26 % Net income (loss): Net income (loss) - GAAP $ (2,045 ) $ 61 $ (2,106 ) NM $ 12,184 $ 11,044 $ 1,140 10 % Impact of TCJA 1,732 — 1,732 NM 1,732 — 1,732 NM Adjusted net income (loss) - Non-GAAP $ (313 ) $ 61 $ (374 ) NM $ 13,916 $ 11,044 $ 2,872 26 NA – Not applicable\nNM – Not meaningful\n*See Segment Data at the end of this Earnings Release\nResults of Operations for the Fourth Quarter of 2017 Compared to the Fourth Quarter of 2016\nCore Bank (3) – Net income from Core Banking was $6.9 million for the fourth quarter of 2017, a decrease of $3.1 million from the fourth quarter of 2016. Approximately $4.6 million of the Company’s TCJA-driven charge to income tax expense was tied to the Core Bank. Excluding the previously mentioned charge to income tax expense, Core Bank non-GAAP net income (as adjusted) for the fourth quarter of 2017 would have increased $1.5 million, or 15%, from the fourth quarter of 2016.\nCore Bank net interest income increased $6.3 million, or 17%, over the fourth quarter of 2016. The growth in net interest income was propelled by a 30-basis-point rise in the Core Bank’s net interest margin for the fourth quarter of 2017 to 3.72% and further complemented by a $137 million, or 4%, increase in the Core Bank’s quarterly average loans.\nThe overall change in the Core Bank’s net interest income, as well as average and period-end loan balances by origination channel, is presented below:\nNet Interest Income for the (dollars in thousands) Three Months Ended Dec. 31, Origination Channel 2017 2016 $ Change\n% Change Traditional Network $ 37,529 $ 31,604 $ 5,925 19 % Warehouse Lending 4,460 5,160 (700 ) (14 ) Correspondent Lending 247 336 (89 ) (26 ) 2012-FDIC Acquired Loans 1,648 525 1,123 214 Total Core Bank $ 43,884 $ 37,625 $ 6,259 17 Average Loan Balances Period-End Loan Balances (dollars in thousands) Three Months Ended Dec. 31, Dec. 31, Origination Channel 2017 2016 $ Change\n% Change 2017 2016 $ Change\n% Change Traditional Network $ 3,247,472 $ 3,003,553 $ 243,919 8 % $ 3,286,582 $ 3,022,305 $ 264,277 9 % Warehouse Lending 523,725 590,196 (66,471 ) (11 ) 525,573 585,439 (59,866 ) (10 ) Correspondent Lending 120,734 152,481 (31,747 ) (21 ) 116,792 149,028 (32,236 ) (22 ) 2012-FDIC Acquired Loans 6,836 15,672 (8,836 ) (56 ) 6,551 15,059 (8,508 ) (57 ) Total Core Bank $ 3,898,767 $ 3,761,902 $ 136,865 4 $ 3,935,498 $ 3,771,831 $ 163,667 4 The following factors were the primary drivers of the changes in the Core Bank’s net interest income and average loan balances by origination channel for the fourth quarter of 2017, as compared to the fourth quarter of 2016:\nThe Core Bank’s Traditional Network experienced solid average loan growth of $244 million from the fourth quarter of 2016 to the fourth quarter of 2017. The overall mix of this growth was well diversified, with average balance increases of $149 million in commercial real estate; $79 million in commercial and industrial; and $35 million in the construction and development category. The Core Bank’s Traditional Network received a favorable payoff of a purchased credit-impaired loan acquired in the Company’s 2016 acquisition of Cornerstone Bancorp, Inc. This favorable payoff contributed approximately $670,000 of non-recurring interest income and approximately six basis points of net interest margin to the Core Bank for the fourth quarter of 2017. The Core Bank’s 2012 FDIC-Acquired loans contributed $1.1 million more in net interest income during the fourth quarter of 2017 compared to the same period in 2016, resulting from the payoff of one large loan and a credit to income of $1.6 million of discount associated with this loan. Overall, accretion income from the 2012 FDIC-Acquired loans contributed 13 basis points to the Core Bank’s net interest margin during the fourth quarter of 2017 compared to a one-basis-point contribution for the same period in 2016. Prospective accretion income related to these loans is expected to be nominal, as the substantial majority of discount accretion from these loans has now been recognized. Within the Warehouse segment, net interest income decreased $700,000, or 14%, from the fourth quarter of 2016, as an increase in mortgage interest rates during the quarter contributed to a decline in client usage of the Bank’s Warehouse lines of credit. Overall, usage rates decreased from 58% during the fourth quarter of 2016 to 50% for the fourth quarter of 2017. Primarily as a result of this factor, average outstanding Warehouse line-of-credit balances for the fourth quarter of 2017 were $524 million, a $66 million, or 11%, decrease from a robust fourth quarter in 2016.\nThe Core Bank’s provision expense for the fourth quarters of 2017 and 2016 primarily represented general loss reserves driven by growth in the loan portfolio during the two periods. The Core Bank’s credit quality metrics remained favorable, as indicated by the table below:\nAs of and for the: Quarters Ended: Years Ended: Dec. 31, Sep. 30, Jun. 30, Mar. 31, Dec. 31, Dec. 31, Dec. 31, Core Banking Credit Quality Ratios 2017 2017 2017 2017 2017 2016 2015 Nonperforming loans to total loans 0.36 % 0.40 % 0.40 % 0.46 % 0.36 % 0.42 % 0.66 % Nonperforming assets to total loans (including OREO) 0.36 0.40 0.41 0.50 0.36 0.46 0.70 Delinquent loans to total loans(6) 0.21 0.20 0.18 0.16 0.21 0.18 0.35 Net charge-offs to average loans 0.06 0.03 0.05 0.02 0.04 0.05 0.05 (Quarterly rates annualized) OREO = Other Real Estate Owned Noninterest income for the Core Bank was $7.9 million during the fourth quarter of 2017, a $24,000 increase from the fourth quarter of 2016. Notable fluctuations in noninterest income for the quarter included the following items:\nInterchange fees increased $247,000 primarily due to an 11% year-over-year growth in active debit cards. Partially offsetting the increase above, the Core Bank recorded $136,000 in losses on the sale of two securities during the fourth quarter of 2017, with no similar sales during the fourth quarter of 2016.\nCore Bank noninterest expenses increased $4.5 million, or 16%, from the fourth quarter of 2016 to the same period in 2017. Comparability of noninterest expense between the two quarters was impacted by adjustments to the Core Bank’s incentive compensation accruals, which were made during both periods to bring accrual balances in line with projected payouts. As a result of these adjustments, net incentive compensation expense was a net charge of $457,000 for the fourth quarter of 2017 compared to a net credit of $393,000 for the fourth quarter of 2016. Excluding the impact of the change in incentive compensation expense, noninterest expense increased $3.9 million, or 13%, for the fourth quarter of 2017, as compared to the fourth quarter of 2016 and was primarily driven by the following:\nSalaries and employee benefits expense increased $2.2 million, or 13%, as the Core Bank’s full-time-equivalent employees increased by 46 employees during 2017 to support the Core Bank’s strategic initiatives. Occupancy expense increased $919,000, primarily due to increases in rent, depreciation, and equipment service expense resulting from new locations, existing banking center renovations and the cost of technology to support the Core Bank’s strategic initiatives. Data processing expense increased $823,000, with a large portion of this increase due to estimated conversion-related expenses for an upcoming change to the Company’s digital-banking vendor for its commercial clients.\nRepublic Processing Group (5)\nRepublic Processing Group (“RPG”) reported a net loss of $2.0 million for the fourth quarter of 2017 compared to net income of $61,000 for the same period in 2016. Approximately $1.7 million of the Company’s TCJA-driven charge to income tax expense was tied to RPG. Excluding the previously mentioned charge to income tax expense, RPG would have reflected a $313,000 non-GAAP loss (as adjusted) for the fourth quarter of 2017.\nWithin the Republic Credit Solutions (“RCS”) segment of RPG, net income decreased $1.6 million primarily due to RCS’s $1.7 million portion of the TCJA-driven charge to income tax expense. Pre-tax earnings for RCS increased to $2.6 million for the fourth quarter of 2017 compared to $2.4 million for the same period in 2016. The nominal increase in pre-tax earnings at RCS was primarily driven by growth in net interest income and largely offset by greater provisions for loan losses, with the change in both income statement categories resulting from a higher volume of RCS’s line-of-credit product during the fourth quarter of 2017 as compared to the fourth quarter of 2016.\nThe Tax Refund Solutions (“TRS”) segment of RPG reported an expected net loss of $2.0 million for the fourth quarter of 2017 compared to a net loss of $1.5 million during the fourth quarter of 2016. The higher net loss for the fourth quarter of 2017 was primarily driven by a $673,000 increase in salaries and employee benefits expense resulting from additional contract labor retained to prepare for the 2018 tax season. The TRS segment derives substantially all of its revenues during the first and second quarters of the year and historically operates at a net loss during the second half of the year, as the Company prepares for the next tax season.\nRepublic Bancorp, Inc.

Financial Information\nFourth Quarter 2017 Earnings Release (continued)\nSegment Data:\nReportable segments are determined by the type of products and services offered and the level of information provided to the chief operating decision maker, who uses such information to review performance of various components of the business (such as banking centers and business units), which are then aggregated if operating performance, products/services, and clients are similar.\nAs of December 31, 2017, the Company was divided into five distinct reportable segments: Traditional Banking, Warehouse Lending (“Warehouse”), Mortgage Banking, Tax Refund Solutions (“TRS”) and Republic Credit Solutions (“RCS”). Management considers the first three segments to collectively constitute the “Core Bank” or “Core Banking” operations, while the last two segments collectively constitute the Republic Processing Group (“RPG”) operations. The Bank’s Correspondent Lending channel and the Company’s national branchless banking platform, MemoryBank ® , are considered part of the Traditional Banking segment.\nPrior to the third quarter of 2017, management reported RPG as a segment consisting of its largest division, TRS, along with its relatively smaller divisions, Republic Payment Solutions (“RPS”) and RCS. During the third quarter of 2017, due to RCS’s growth in revenues relative to the total Company’s revenues, management identified TRS and RCS as separate reportable segments under the newly classified RPG operations. Also, as part of the updated segmentation, management will report the RPS division, which remained below thresholds to be classified a separate reportable segment, within the newly classified TRS segment. The reportable segments within RPG operations and divisions within those segments operate through the Bank. All prior periods have been reclassified to conform to the current presentation.\nThe nature of segment operations and the primary drivers of net revenues by reportable segment are provided below:\nReportable Segment: Nature of Operations: Primary Drivers of Net Revenues: Core Banking: Traditional Banking Provides traditional banking products to clients primarily in its market footprint via its network of banking centers and to clients outside of its market footprint primarily via its Digital and Correspondent Lending delivery channels. Loans, investments, and deposits. Warehouse Lending Provides short-term, revolving credit facilities to mortgage bankers across the United States. Mortgage warehouse lines of credit. Mortgage Banking Primarily originates, sells and services long-term, single family, first lien residential real estate loans primarily to clients in the Bank’s market footprint.\nLoan sales and servicing. Republic Processing Group: Tax Refund Solutions TRS offers tax-related credit products and facilitates the receipt and payment of federal and state tax refund products. The RPS division of TRS offers general-purpose reloadable cards. TRS and RPS products are primarily provided to clients outside of the Bank’s market footprint. Loans, refund transfers, and prepaid cards. Republic Credit Solutions Offers short-term credit products. RCS products are primarily provided to clients outside of the Bank’s market footprint, with a substantial portion of RCS clients considered subprime or near prime borrowers. Unsecured small-dollar, consumer loans. The accounting policies used for Republic’s reportable segments are the same as those described in the summary of significant accounting policies in the Company’s 2016 Annual Report on Form 10-K. Segment performance is evaluated using operating income. Goodwill is allocated to the Traditional Banking segment. Income taxes are generally allocated based on income before income tax expense unless specific segment allocations can be reasonably made. Transactions among reportable segments are made at carrying value.\nRepublic Bancorp, Inc.

The amount recorded is based on a reasonable estimate using currently available information. The Company has up to one year to adjust this amount for new information received.\n(2)\nGAAP – U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles.\n(3)\n“Core Bank” or “Core Banking” operations consist of the Traditional Banking, Warehouse Lending and Mortgage Banking segments.\n(4)\nCore deposits, a non-GAAP measure, are total deposits excluding time deposits greater than or equal to $250,000, all brokered deposits and all RPG deposits. Core deposits are intended to include those deposits that are more stable and lower cost and that reprice more slowly than other deposits when interest rates rise.

Depending on loan class, loan delinquency is determined by the number of days or the number of payments past due.\n(7)\nThe amount of loan fee income can meaningfully impact total interest income, loan yields, net interest margin and net interest spread. The amount of loan fee income included in total interest income was $9.4 million and $5.9 million for the quarters ended December 31, 2017 and 2016. The amount of loan fee income included in total interest income was $46.2 million and $24.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016.\nThe amount of loan fee income included in total interest income per quarter was as follows: $9.4 million (quarter ended December 31, 2017); $9.1 million (quarter ended September 30, 2017); $6.4 million (quarter ended June 30, 2017); $21.3 million (quarter ended March 31, 2017); and $5.9 million (quarter ended December 31, 2016).\nInterest income for Easy Advances (“EAs”) is composed entirely of loan fees.
