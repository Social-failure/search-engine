A police van carrying dismissed Catalan Vice President Oriol Junqueras, currently in custody awaiting trial on charges of sedition, rebellion and misappropriation of funds, enters the Supreme Court where Junqueras was to appear before a judge after requesting his release in Madrid, Spain, January 4, 2018. REUTERS/Susana Vera \nPuigdemont remains in self-imposed exile in Brussels, though he has said he would return to Catalonia if the Spanish government gave him certain “guarantees”, likely a promise not to arrest him. \nEsquerra lawmakers have said Puigdemont has the right to again be Catalan president, but if he is unable to return from Brussels he should step aside for Junqueras. Esquerra and Junts per Catalunya, along with a smaller separatist party, have not yet agreed on a coalition. \nJunqueras said at the Thursday hearing he was a “man of peace” and of “dialogue,” his lawyer Andreu Van Den Eynde told reporters outside the courthouse. He is in custody on allegations of rebellion, sedition and misuse of public funds. \nThe court said it would not reach a decision on Thursday. \nRajoy fired both Junqueras and Puigdemont when he imposed direct control over Catalonia after the separatist-controlled government declared independence following an Oct. 1 referendum on secession from Spain, which courts ruled illegal. \nThe political instability in Catalonia, which accounts for a fifth of Spain’s economy, has deterred tourists and prompted more than 3,000 companies, including the region’s two biggest banks, to move their legal headquarters elsewhere in Spain.
