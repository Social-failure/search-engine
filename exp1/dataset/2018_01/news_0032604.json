Soccer Football - Bundesliga - Hertha BSC vs Borussia Dortmund - Olympiastadion, Berlin, Germany - January 19, 2018 Borussia Dortmund’s Jadon Sancho REUTERS/Hannibal Hanschke \nHis absence was again clearly evident as Dortmund had few chances in a subdued first half before Davie Selke put Hertha ahead seconds after the restart. \nDortmund levelled by taking advantage of a defensive error when Shinji Kagawa headed in at the far post in the 71st. Slideshow (7 Images) \nThe visitors could have snatched a late winner but Sancho curled his shot wide and Alexander Isak fired against the bar. \nDortmund have 30 points and trail Bundesliga leaders Bayern Munich who have 44 before they host Werder Bremen on Sunday. \nSecond-placed Leipzig on 31 visit Freiburg on Saturday.
