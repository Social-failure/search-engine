The company won that appeal in December.\nThe NEB said it hopes the new process, which was requested by Kinder Morgan, will be used sparingly and that all participants will approach future permitting on a good faith basis, noting that the company must comply with all local laws.\nSeparately, the NEB said it will hold hearings in Burnaby starting next week on the final route of the expansion, which is a twinning of an existing line from Alberta’s energy heartland to the British Columbia coast.\nReporting by Julie Gordon in Vancouver; additional reporting by Philip George in Bengaluru; Editing by Tom Brown and Amrutha Gayathri\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-19T01:33:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-19T01:56:54.003+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
