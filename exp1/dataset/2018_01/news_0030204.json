On an annual basis, it generates approximately 65 gigawatt-hours of solar energy, saving over 21,000 tonnes of CO2 a year, BSR said. \nShell Energy Europe, an energy marketing and trading division of Royal Dutch Shell, is present in 14 European power markets, which includes the offtake of renewable power from wind farms and solar parks in Britain and Europe. \nShell will be taking all the power from the solar plant, Graham Harding, BSR chief financial officer, told Reuters. \nNo details were provided on the cost of the deal.
