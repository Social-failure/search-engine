Russell, Darren Aronofsky and Damien Chazelle, who all got their starts at Sundance, have gone on to enjoy studio success. \n\nFILE PHOTO - 75th Golden Globe Awards – Arrivals – Beverly Hills, California, U.S., 07/01/2018 – Director Reed Morano. REUTERS/Mario Anzuoni This year’s Sundance festival comes amid the rise of the Time’s Up movement in Hollywood, launched by more than 300 industry figures to fight against sexual misconduct and discrimination in the workplace. \nSeveral panels at the festival focused on the gender gap in Hollywood with actresses such as Octavia Spencer speaking out about pay parity. Spencer said she and Jessica Chastain had teamed up to negotiate five times her asking salary for an upcoming film the two are working on together. \nAlong with pay issues, many filmmakers are looking for stories that move beyond female typecasts. \nReed Morano first came to Sundance in 2008 as the cinematographer for “Frozen River.” This year, she returned to Sundance with her film directorial debut “I Think We’re Alone Now,” centered on a man (Peter Dinklage) and a teenage girl (Elle Fanning) in a post-apocalyptic world. \n“Out of 10 projects I get sent, seven or eight are female protagonists and that’s not the only thing I‘m interested in,” Morano said. \n“I do think it’s unfair for women who get pegged with creating fare for other women,” she added. \nAfter writing and directing two films with strong female leads, Fidell said she purposely chose to center her latest film “The Long Dumb Road” on the story of two boys. \n“I was getting boxed into only making stories about women going crazy or young adult love stories,” Fidell said. “I made this hoping that ... it would really open up new doors for projects.” \nReporting by Piya Sinha-Roy, editing by G Crosse\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-27T16:36:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-27T16:52:06.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
