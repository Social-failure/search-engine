(NASDAQ:TSBK) (“Timberland” or “the Company”) today reported net income of $3.61 million, or $0.48 per diluted common share, for its first fiscal quarter ended December 31, 2017. This compares to net income of $3.15 million, or $0.43 per diluted common share, for the quarter ended December 31, 2016, and net income of $3.62 million, or $0.48 per diluted common share for the preceding quarter ended September 30, 2017.\nTimberland’s Board of Directors also announced an 18% increase in the quarterly cash dividend to shareholders to $0.13 per common share, payable on February 28, 2018 to shareholders of record on February 14, 2018.\n“The recently enacted tax reform legislation will materially reduce Timberland’s 2018 fiscal year income tax expense. Fiscal year companies, such as Timberland, were able to use a reduced tax rate for the recently completed December quarter,” said Michael Sand, President and CEO. “For the December quarter, a blended tax rate of 24.5% was applicable to the Company’s current taxable income rather than the previously employed 35% rate. This blended rate will also apply to the Company’s taxable income for each of the next three quarters, after which the Company will cease using the blended rate and revert to the newly legislated 21% corporate tax rate. During the quarter, the Company incurred a one-time tax expense of $548,000 to write down its net deferred tax asset and that expense was fully offset by a $551,000 tax benefit gained by using the blended rate. We have continued to grow our franchise by increasing loans and deposits, expanding net interest margin and maintaining solid asset quality,” stated Sand. “Additionally, based on a number of factors including the Company’s sustained strong financial performance, its Board of Directors voted to increase the quarterly cash dividend by 18% to $0.13 per share from the $0.11 per share dividend declared for each of the previous four quarters.”\nFirst Fiscal Quarter 2018 Earnings and Balance Sheet Highlights (at or for the period ended December 31, 2017, compared to December 31, 2016, or September 30, 2017):\nEarnings Highlights:\nNet income increased 15% to $3.61 million from $3.15 million for the comparable quarter one year ago; Earnings per diluted common share (“EPS”) increased 12% to $0.48 from $0.43 for the comparable quarter one year ago; Return on average equity and return on average assets for the current quarter remained strong at 12.90% and 1.50%, respectively; Operating revenue increased 9% from the comparable quarter one year ago and 3% from the preceding quarter; and Net interest margin improved to 4.19% from 3.91% for the comparable quarter one year ago and from 4.18% for the preceding quarter.\nBalance Sheet Highlights:\nIncreased total assets 8% year-over-year and 4% from the prior quarter; Increased net loans receivable 5% year-over-year and 2% from the prior quarter; Increased total deposits 11% year-over-year and 5% from the prior quarter; Decreased non-performing assets 15% year-over-year and 4% from the prior quarter; and Increased book and tangible book (non-GAAP) values per common share to $15.49 and $14.72, respectively, at December 31, 2017.\nOperating Results\nOperating revenue (net interest income before provision for loan losses, plus non-interest income excluding gains or losses on the sale of investment securities and recoveries or other than temporary impairment (“OTTI”) charges on investment securities) increased 9% for the current quarter to $12.55 million from $11.53 million for the comparable quarter one year ago and increased 3% from $12.24 million for the preceding quarter.\nNet interest income for the current quarter increased 13% to $9.43 million from $8.31 million for the comparable quarter one year ago and increased 3% from $9.13 million for the preceding quarter. The increases were primarily due to increases in average total interest-earning assets and increases in the yield earned on average total interest-earning assets.\nThe net interest margin (“NIM”) for the current quarter improved to 4.19% from 3.91% for the comparable quarter one year ago and from 4.18% for the preceding quarter. The NIM for the current quarter was increased by approximately two basis points due to the collection of $45,000 of non-accrual interest. The NIM for the comparable quarter one year ago was increased by approximately one basis point due to the collection of $21,000 of non-accrual interest and the NIM for the preceding quarter was increased by less than one basis point due to the collection of $8,000 of non-accrual interest.\nNon-interest income decreased slightly to $3.14 million for the current quarter from $3.15 million for the preceding quarter and decreased 2% from $3.22 million for the comparable quarter one year ago. The decreased non-interest income for the current quarter compared to the preceding quarter was primarily due to a decrease in the ATM and debit card interchange transaction fees, which was partially offset by an increase in gain on sales of loans.\nTotal operating expenses for the current quarter increased 4% to $7.18 million from $6.91 million for the preceding quarter and increased 5% from $6.81 million for the comparable quarter one year ago. The increased expenses for the current quarter compared to the preceding quarter were primarily due to increases in the salaries and employee benefits and OREO and other repossessed assets categories. The increase in salaries and employee benefits was primarily due to typical annual salary adjustments and the hiring of additional lending personnel. The increase in OREO and other repossessed assets expense was primarily due to market value write-downs on two real estate properties and one personal property during the quarter. The efficiency ratio for the current quarter was 57.08% compared to 56.31% for the preceding quarter and 59.07% for the comparable quarter one year ago.\nThe provision for income taxes for the current quarter increased to $1.78 million from $1.75 million for the preceding quarter, and was impacted by the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act Legislation which was signed into law on December 22, 2017. As a result of the new legislation (which decreases the federal corporate income tax rate to 21.0% from 35.0%), Timberland recorded a one-time income tax expense of $548,000 in conjunction with writing down its net deferred tax asset (“DTA”). Since Timberland is a September 30 th fiscal year-end corporation, it will use a blended tax rate of 24.5% for the fiscal year ending September 30, 2018 and then use a 21.0% rate thereafter. The impact of using the 24.5% blended tax rate for the current quarter versus a 35.0% tax rate reduced the provision for income tax expense by approximately $551,000 and offset the one-time $548,000 DTA write-down.\nBalance Sheet Management\nTotal assets increased $41.87 million, or 4%, during the first fiscal quarter to $993.90 million at December 31, 2017 from $952.02 million at September 30, 2017. The increase was primarily due to a $28.51 million increase in cash and cash equivalents and CDs held for investment and a $14.90 million increase in net loans receivable which were funded by increased deposits.\nLiquidity, as measured by the sum of cash and cash equivalents, CDs held for investment and available for sale investment securities, was 25.1% of total liabilities at December 31, 2017, compared to 22.9% at September 30, 2017, and 23.1% one year ago.\nNet loans receivable increased $14.90 million, or 2%, to $705.27 million at December 31, 2017, from $690.36 million at September 30, 2017. The increase was primarily due to a $5.72 million increase in custom and owner/builder one- to four-family construction loans, a $4.16 million increase in commercial real estate loans, a $3.27 million increase in multi-family construction loans, a $2.96 million decrease in the amount of undisbursed construction loans in process, a $2.76 million increase in multi-family mortgage loans, a $2.37 million increase in commercial construction loans and smaller increases in several other categories. These increases were partially offset by a $2.79 million decrease in land loans, a $2.67 million decrease in speculative one- to four-family construction loans, a $1.17 million decrease in one- to four-family mortgage loans and smaller decreases in several other categories.\nLOAN PORTFOLIO ($ in thousands) December 31, 2017 September 30, 2017 December 31, 2016 Amount Percent Amount Percent Amount Percent Mortgage loans: One- to four-family (a) $ 116,976 15 % $ 118,147 15 % $ 119,485 16 % Multi-family 61,366 8 58,607 7 52,062 7 Commercial 333,085 42 328,927 42 323,496 44 Construction - custom and owner/builder 123,365 15 117,641 15 96,292 13 Construction - speculative\none- to four-family 7,253 1 9,918 1 6,133 1 Construction - commercial 22,000 3 19,630 3 8,627 1 Construction - multi-family 24,601 3 21,327 3 22,092 3 Land 21,122 2 23,910 3 22,359 3 Total mortgage loans 709,768 89 698,107 89 650,546 88 Consumer loans: Home equity and second mortgage 38,975 5 38,420 5 37,602 5 Other 4,050 -- 3,823 -- 4,523 1 Total consumer loans 43,025 5 42,243 5 42,125 6 Commercial business loans (b) 43,993 6 44,444 6 42,657 6 Total loans 796,786 100 % 784,794 100 % 735,328 100 % Less: Undisbursed portion of construction loans in process (79,449 ) (82,411 ) (54,161 ) Deferred loan origination fees (2,504 ) (2,466 ) (2,184 ) Allowance for loan losses (9,565 ) (9,553 ) (9,843 ) Total loans receivable, net $ 705,268 $ 690,364 $ 669,140\n(a) Does not include one- to four-family loans held for sale totaling $3,236, $3,515 and $2,008 at December 31, 2017, September 30, 2017, and December 31, 2016, respectively.\n(b) Does not include commercial business loans held for sale totaling $171 and $84 at December 31, 2017 and September 30, 2017, respectively.\nTimberland originated $82.51 million in loans during the quarter ended December 31, 2017, compared to $90.15 million for the comparable quarter one year ago and $85.10 million for the preceding quarter. Timberland continues to sell fixed rate one- to four-family mortgage loans into the secondary market for asset-liability management purposes and to generate non-interest income. Timberland also (on a much smaller volume) periodically sells the guaranteed portion of U.S. Small Business Administration (“SBA”) loans. During the first quarter of fiscal 2018, fixed-rate one- to four-family mortgage loans and SBA loans totaling $15.91 million were sold compared to $24.20 million for the comparable quarter one year ago and $15.88 million for the preceding quarter.\nTimberland’s investment securities and other investments decreased $82,000, or 1%, to $11.30 million at December 31, 2017, from $11.38 million at September 30, 2017, primarily due to scheduled amortization.\nDEPOSIT BREAKDOWN\n($ in thousands) December 31, 2017 September 30, 2017 December 31, 2016 Amount Percent Amount Percent Amount Percent Non-interest-bearing demand $ 210,108 24 % $ 205,952 25 % $ 176,382 22 % NOW checking 218,422 25 220,315 26 207,415 26 Savings 142,660 16 140,987 17 131,124 17 Money market 156,665 18 122,877 15 122,026 15 Money market – brokered 10,796 1 8,125 1 6,912 1 Certificates of deposit under $250 118,017 14 120,844 14 127,035 17 Certificates of deposit $250 and over 16,208 2 15,601 2 15,872 2 Certificates of deposit – brokered 3,198 -- 3,197 -- 3,209 -- Total deposits $ 876,074 100 % $ 837,898 100 % $ 789,975 100 % Total deposits increased $38.18 million, or 5%, during the current quarter to $876.07 million at December 31, 2017, from $837.90 million at September 30, 2017. This increase was primarily due to a $36.46 million increase in money market account balances, a $4.16 million increase in non-interest-bearing demand account balances and a $1.67 million increase savings account balances. These increases were partially offset by a $2.22 million decrease in certificates of deposit account balances and a $1.89 million decrease in NOW checking account balances. The increase in money market account balances was primarily due to a commercial customer making a large deposit ($28.7 million). The majority of this deposit is scheduled to be withdrawn during January, 2018.\nShareholders’ Equity\nTotal shareholders’ equity increased $3.11 million to $114.11 million at December 31, 2017, from $111.00 million at September 30, 2017. The increase in shareholders’ equity was primarily due to net income of $3.61 million for the quarter, which was partially offset by dividend payments of $810,000 to shareholders.\nCapital Ratios and Asset Quality\nTimberland remains well capitalized with a total risk-based capital ratio of 17.74% and a Tier 1 leverage capital ratio of 11.45% at December 31, 2017.\nNo provision for loan losses was made for the quarters ended December 31, 2017, September 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016. Timberland had a net recovery of $12,000 for the current quarter compared to net charge-offs of $57,000 for the preceding quarter and a net recovery of $17,000 for the comparable quarter one year ago. The allowance for loan losses was 1.34% of loans receivable at December 31, 2017, compared to 1.36% at September 30, 2017 and 1.45% at December 31, 2016.\nTotal delinquent loans (past due 30 days or more) and non-accrual loans decreased 23% to $3.12 million at December 31, 2017, from $4.06 million one year ago, and increased 29% from $2.41 million at September 30, 2017. Non-accrual loans decreased 11% to $2.11 million at December 31, 2017 from $2.36 million one year ago, and increased 11% from $1.91 million at September 30, 2017.\nNON-ACCRUAL LOANS December 31, 2017 September 30, 2017 December 31, 2016 ($ in thousands) Amount Quantity Amount Quantity Amount Quantity Mortgage loans: One- to four-family $ 947 8 $ 874 7 $ 846 7 Commercial 402 3 213 2 -- -- Construction -- -- -- -- 367 1 Land 395 4 566 4 735 5 Total mortgage loans 1,744 15 1,653 13 1,948 13 Consumer loans: Home equity and second mortgage 188 4 258 3 387 5 Other -- -- -- -- 29 1 Total consumer loans 188 4 258 3 416 6 Commercial business 181 2 -- -- -- -- Total loans $ 2,113 21 $ 1,911 16 $ 2,364 19 OREO and other repossessed assets decreased 13% to $2.89 million at December 31, 2017, from $3.30 million at September 30, 2017, and decreased 11% from $3.25 million at December 31, 2016. At December 31, 2017, the OREO and other repossessed asset portfolio consisted of 14 individual real estate properties and one recreational vehicle.

Timberland believes that certain non-GAAP financial measures provide investors with information useful in understanding the Company’s financial performance; however, readers of this report are urged to review these non-GAAP financial measures in conjunction with GAAP results as reported.\nFinancial measures that exclude intangible assets are non-GAAP measures. To provide investors with a broader understanding of capital adequacy, Timberland provides non-GAAP financial measures for tangible common equity, along with the GAAP measure. Tangible common equity is calculated as shareholders’ equity less goodwill. In addition, tangible assets equal total assets less goodwill.\nThe following table provides a reconciliation of ending shareholders’ equity (GAAP) to ending tangible shareholders’ equity (non-GAAP), and ending total assets (GAAP) to ending tangible assets (non-GAAP).\n($ in thousands) December 31, 2017 September 30, 2017 December 31, 2016 Shareholders’ equity $ 114,112 $ 111,000 $ 99,634 Less goodwill (5,650 ) (5,650 ) (5,650 ) Tangible common equity $ 108,462 $ 105,350 $ 93,984 Total assets $ 993,895 $ 952,024 $ 923,751 Less goodwill (5,650 ) (5,650 ) (5,650 ) Tangible assets $ 988,245 $ 946,374 $ 918,101 About Timberland Bancorp, Inc.\nTimberland Bancorp, Inc., a Washington corporation, is the holding company for Timberland Bank (“Bank”).
