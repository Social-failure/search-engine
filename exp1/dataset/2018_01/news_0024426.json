However, many questioned exactly where that increased spending would go. \nOver the holidays, the strongest performers were building materials and supply stores (8.1 percent growth ), furniture (7.5 percent growth) and electronics (6.7 percent growth). Clothing/accessories and health/personal care clocked in weaker growth, up 2.7 percent and 2.2 percent, respectively. \nSporting good stores were the one area where the industry posted a decline, with sales down 0.5 percent. The industry has been under pressure as shoppers can buy sporting goods at big-box stores and online. Dick's Sporting Goods stock is down roughly 43 percent since December 2016. Several retailers in the category have gone bankrupt such as Sports Authority and Gander Mountain.
