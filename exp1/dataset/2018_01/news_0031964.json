Qatar has said the claims are “completely untrue”. \nThe complaint was in the form of a note submitted to both the U.N. Security Council president and the U.N. General Assembly president. It said the interception was a threat to the safety of the civil flights a breach to the rules of international law, WAM reported. \nThe UAE, along with Saudi Arabia, Bahrain and Egypt, has imposed travel, diplomatic and trade sanctions on Qatar since last June, accusing it of supporting terrorism. \nQatar denies the charge and has accused the four countries of trying to make it conform to their foreign policy positions. \nThe UAE has banned Qatari aircraft from using its airspace as part of the restrictions imposed since June. Qatar has not reciprocated.
