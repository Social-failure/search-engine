As a result, Carillion went into liquidation, forcing the government to step in to guarantee public services provided by the company ranging from school meals to road works. \nJLIF nine operational PPP projects where Carillion manages facilities include four schools projects, four emergency services projects and one road project, the fund said last week The value of these projects is about 8.5 percent of the total portfolio value and about 9.6 percent of its net asset value, it said then. \n“The (fund‘s) investment adviser believes that the compulsory liquidation of Carillion should have no material impact on the Company and no impact on the company’s dividend policy,” JLIF said in a statement on Monday. \nBritish investment firm HICL Infrastructure ( HICL.L ) said on Friday the collapse of Carillion had triggered loan defaults at projects and management subcontracts with the construction outsourcing company, sending its shares to a three-year low.
