In total, we made changes that reduced time spent on Facebook by roughly 50 million hours every day. By focusing on meaningful connections, our community and business will be stronger over the long term,\" Zuckerberg wrote. \nThe company has also begun to make changes to its content-recommendation software amid criticism that Facebook has been used to spread misinformation, hate speech and other violent content. \nOn the company's previous earnings call in November, Zuckerberg had said: \"I want to be clear about what our priority is. Protecting our community is more important than maximizing our profits.\" \nZuckerberg made the comments as part of the company's fourth-quarter earnings announcement.
