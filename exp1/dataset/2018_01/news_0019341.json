SHIFT IN TONE \nThe tone of discussion had looked very different early on Thursday. \nDurbin, the No. 2 Democrat in the Senate, called the White House to tell Trump that a bipartisan group of senators had struck a deal to put Dreamers on a path to citizenship, beef up border security and take other steps to change immigration laws. \nAround 10:15 a.m., Trump returned Durbin’s call and was told about the main elements of the deal. \nBen Marter, a spokesman for Durbin, did not provide details of the conversation but said the senator was “encouraged” by Trump’s reaction. \nTrump said Durbin and Graham - two seasoned lawmakers - should come to the White House for a meeting at noon. Durbin thought it would just be the senators and Trump in the room. \nInstead, Trump had also invited some of Congress’ hard-line opponents of the bipartisan agreement being put together by the six-member working group led by Durbin and Graham. \nRepublican Senator Tom Cotton and Republican Representative Bob Goodlatte were both there, as was White House aide Stephen Miller, a proponent of severely limiting immigration. \nGraham and Durbin laid out the details of their proposed legislation. But instead of winning Trump’s support, as they had expected, the president launched into a broadside against immigration from Haiti and Africa. \nAt one point, Trump, according to two sources, said: “Why do we want all these people from Africa here? They’re shithole countries. ... We should have more people from Norway.” \nDurbin said Graham immediately spoke up against Trump’s comments, and he commended the Republican senator for doing so. \nCommenting on the White House meeting, Graham said on Friday that diversity had always been the United States’ strength. \n“Following comments by the President, I said my piece directly to him yesterday. The President and all those attending the meeting know what I said and how I feel,” Graham said in a statement. \nOnce it was clear by mid-afternoon on Thursday that Trump was not going to support the bipartisan deal, the group led by Durbin and Graham issued a terse statement. \n“We have been working for four months and have reached an agreement in principle” that addresses the main policies Trump sought, they said. “We are now working to build support for that deal in Congress.” \nThere was no mention at that time of the language that sources said Trump had used, details of which were soon leaked.
