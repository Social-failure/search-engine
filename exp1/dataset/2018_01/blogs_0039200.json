Intacta's patent protection extends through October 2022. \nIn a document dated Jan. 17, the solicitor general's office said the patent office, INPI, issued a technical opinion in December arguing that the patent, PI0016460-7, \"is at odds with legal requirements.\" \nMonsanto said in a statement on Monday that it was informed of INPI's opinion and said it will challenge the allegations in due course. \nAprosoja hailed INPI's opinion as \"recognition\" by the patent office that Intacta's patent is not valid.
