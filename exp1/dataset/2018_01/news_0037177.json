The 23-year-old won the DP World Tour Championship in November and Sunday’s victory was his second on the PGA Tour. \nThe world number three started the final day two behind 54-hole leader Austin Cook and Landry was one behind. \nCook’s chances faded when he went three over after six holes. \nMartin Piller, John Huh and Adam Hadwin each finished at 20-under.
