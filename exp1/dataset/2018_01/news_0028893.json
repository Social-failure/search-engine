REUTERS/Carlos Jasso “Will we explore the possibility of an amnesty? Yes. We won’t discard any idea that’s on the table without evaluating it first,” Durazo said. “Will we sit down with the big cartel kingpins? I can’t tell you right now.”\nNonetheless, he stressed that the focus was not on letting criminals off the hook, but rather seeking new ways to end the violence.\nSlideshow (5 Images) Durazo began his career as the private secretary of PRI presidential candidate Luis Colosio, working with him until he was assassinated in the 1994 presidential campaign.\nHe then left the PRI before becoming the spokesman of former President Vicente Fox, of the National Action Party, who led the country from 2000-2006.\nIn 2006, Durazo joined forces with Lopez Obrador, a former Mexico City mayor and two-time presidential runner-up.\nDurazo said there were multiple causes of Mexico’s violence, including poverty and lack of education.\nEditing by Daniel Wallis\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-19T04:20:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-19T04:31:33.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
