Marketing arms are common in the pipeline industry, and most of the top 10 largest U.S. pipeline operators have already established their own marketing or trading arms.\nMagellan requested a rehearing on Dec. 22, in a filing that rivals said raised new issues that could have far-reaching consequences for the oil industry and could jeopardize existing marketing affiliates.\nLast week, oil and gas producers WPX Energy and Chevron asked FERC for a new hearing on the broad industry impact of Magellan’s request.\n(This version of the story was refiled to remove erroneous coding)\nReporting by Devika Krishna Kumar in New York; Editing by Leslie Adler\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-23T00:07:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-23T00:22:14.015+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
