One thing I know is I‘m going to be playing aggressive.” \nChung, ranked 58 in the world, became his nation’s first grand slam semi-finalist and the lowest ranked player to reach the last four at Melbourne Park since Marat Safin in 2004. \nIn the women’s field, world number one Simona Halep produced a sublime display to oust sixth seed Karolina Pliskova of Czech Republic 6-3 6-2 in the quarter-finals. \nHalep came back from an initial 3-0 deficit in the opening set, running off on a nine-game winning streak at one point to wrap up the match in just over an hour. \n“For sure it wasn’t my best start,” Halep said after the match. “I just knew that I had to restart, actually, after three games -- just to stop missing that much and to move better.” \nHalep’s first semi-final appearance in Melbourne will be against 2016 champion Angelique Kerber, who defeated American Madison Keys 6-1 6-2 in the quarter-finals.

To start playing like I did at the end of the match and dominate the match and finish the points.” 0435 CHUNG MASTERS TENNYS TO REACH SEMI-FINALS \nChung Hyeon became the first South Korean to reach the semi-finals of a grand slam when he beat American Tennys Sandgren 6-4 7-6(5) 6-3 in two hours and 28 minutes on Rod Laver Arena. \nThe bespectacled 21-year-old sealed victory when Sandgren went long after an extraordinary final game and will face reigning champion Roger Federer or Tomas Berdych in the last four. 0330 MADISON KEYS ON HER QUARTER-FINAL LOSS \n“Sometimes you just don’t play very well out there.” 0215 FALSE ALARM ON ROD LAVER ARENA \nThe quarter-final between Tennys Sandgren and Chung Hyeon was disrupted early in the first set by an alarm broadcasting “Evacuate! Evacuate! Evacuate!” over the public address system. \nThe players returned to their chairs while umpire James Keothavong investigated and the match resumed after he had confirmed it was a false alarm. 0105 KERBER CRUSHES KEYS TO REACH SEMI-FINALS \nRevitalised 2016 champion Angelique Kerber made a major statement of intent as she stormed into the semi-finals with a dominant 6-1 6-2 victory over Madison Keys. \n“I‘m really enjoying my tennis right now. I enjoy being on court, right now,” the German said. \n“I‘m just happy to get through and be here in the semis.” 0015 PLAY UNDERWAY WITH KERBER AND KEYS CLASH \nPlay got underway on schedule at 11 a.m. local time (0000 GMT) at Melbourne Park with Angelique Kerber and Madison Keys on Rod Laver Arena in the women’s quarter-finals. \nThe temperature was 21 degrees Celsius (69 degrees Fahrenheit) and forecast to reach a high of 24.
