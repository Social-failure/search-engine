William Hill ( WMH.L ) said in October it was concerned that “severe” cuts in the maximum stake were an option in the review. \nThe Sunday Times said the “overwhelming” response to the review had persuaded the government to reduce the maximum to two pounds. \n“Matt (Hancock) wants the new stake to be at the bottom of the range,” the newspaper quoted a Hancock ally as saying. \n“His attitude to (the terminals) is very negative because it takes money from reasonable, mature betting, like on the horses.” \nA Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport spokeswoman said the government was “currently consulting on what the exact cut should be, and would make a final decision in due course once all the evidence has been considered”. \n“We are clear that FOBT stakes will be cut to ensure we have a safe and sustainable industry where vulnerable people and children are protected,” she said. \n($1 = 0.7217 pounds)", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-21T19:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-21T19:13:33.014+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
