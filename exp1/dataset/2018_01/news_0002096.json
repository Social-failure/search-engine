Analyst Sauli Vilen from research firm Inderes gave a rough estimate of around 100 million euros. \nStockmann used to sell books there itself but sold that business to Sweden’s Bonnier in 2015. \nShares in the company, which fell about 40 percent last year, were up 5.2 percent at 4.58 euros by 0915 GMT. \nStockmann has been negotiating with investment company O1 Group on the sale of its St Petersburg department store property, which has a book value of 181 million euros. The process continues, Stockmann said. \nThe total fair value of Stockmann’s real estate assets is 950 million euros, the majority of which is estimated to be made up of the company’s Helsinki flagship department store. \nThe company, known for its premium department stores, has struggled in recent years due to slowdowns in Finland and Russia as well as a consumer shift to online shopping.
