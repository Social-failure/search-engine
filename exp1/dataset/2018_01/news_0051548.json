Kiev has committed to spending 5 percent of the country’s gross domestic product on security and defence. \n“Successful flight tests of new missile weaponry, namely of a land-launched cruise missile, were held. Flight performance and performance of all systems of this new Ukrainian weaponry were checked during the tests,” Turchynov said.
