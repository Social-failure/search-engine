An additional thirteen banks in the index had no CFPB complaints filed about any banking product.\n\"The most common complaint categories in order were: mortgages, debt collection, credit reporting, credit card, and bank accounts or service,\" according to LendEdu research analyst Mike Brown.\nThe analysis ranked the 49 banks by the number of complaints per billions of dollars in deposits.\nTCF National Bank took the top spot as the bank with the most CFPB complaints per billions of dollars in deposits with a score of 13.59.\nThat was followed by SunTrust Banks (7.12 complaints per billions of dollars in deposits) and Citizens Financial Group (6.91).\nTCF Financial disagrees with the methodology of the study because it does not factor in the types of transaction accounts and the mix of retail versus commercial accounts.\n\"When you look objectively at TCF's number of complaints relative to the total number of consumer accounts we bank, our complaint rate is extremely low â€“ and we continue to see year-over-year decreases,\" TCF Financial said in a statement. \"Basing a ranking of total deposits as LendEDU has is simply not an accurate way to assess or rank complaints for the banking industry.\"\nHere are the top ten banks with the most CFPB complaints per billions of dollars in deposits, according to LendEdu:\n1.
