(OTCQX: EFSI), the holding company for Bank of Clarke County, whose divisions include Eagle Investment Group, announces its 2017 fourth quarter and annual profits.\nFourth Quarter and Annual 2017 Highlights:\nQ4\nAnnual\nNet income (000's)\n$1,709\n$7,786\nDiluted EPS\n$0.49\n$2.24\nDividend, per common share\n$0.22\n$0.88\nNet Interest Margin\n4.03%\n4.09%\nLoan Growth, gross (000's)\n$16,726\n$51,875\nDeposit growth (000's)\n$18,168\n$59,536\nJohn R. Milleson, President and CEO, stated, \"2017 showed remarkable growth in consolidated assets. During the year, growth in both loans and deposits averaged $1.0 million per week. We attribute this growth to the unabated churning in the markets we serve, and our efforts at positioning Bank of Clarke to become the bank of choice for many customers seeking another bank home. The fact that we are a strong community bank with convenient locations and channels (both physical and digital) and personable, seasoned community bankers has resonated with many whom have been disillusioned with changes at their (former) banks. To be the top-of-mind first choice with new customers is very rewarding and shows the success our efforts have delivered in becoming a fully immersed part of each and every community we touch.\"\nIncome Statement Review\nNet income was $7.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 which represented an increase of 22.2% when compared to net income in 2016. This increase in net income resulted mostly from the $1.8 million increase in interest and fees on loans. Gross loans increased $51.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. Net income for the quarter ended December 31, 2017 was $1.7 million reflecting a decrease of 5.4% from the quarter ended December 31, 2016. This decrease in net income resulted mostly from the increase in income tax expense. Because the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act was signed into law on December 22, 2017, the Company's deferred tax assets and liabilities were adjusted at December 31, 2017, for the effect of the change in the corporate tax rate. This adjustment resulted in a net increase to federal income tax expense of $430,152.\nNet interest income for the quarter ended December 31, 2017 was $7.0 million and $6.2 million for the same period in 2016. Net interest income for the year ended December 31, 2017 was $27.2 million which represented an increase of 10.0% when compared to $24.7 million in 2016. The increases in net interest income resulted from the increases in the Company's securities and loan portfolios.\nTotal loan interest income was $6.4 million for the quarter ended December 31, 2017 and $5.8 million for the quarter ended December 31, 2016. Total loan interest income was $24.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, reflecting an increase of $1.8 million from the year ended December 31, 2016. Average loans for the quarter ended December 31, 2017 were $562.5 million compared to $516.2 million for the same period in 2016. Average loans for the year ended December 31, 2017 were $541.7 million compared to $510.0 million for 2016. The tax equivalent yield on average loans for the quarter ended December 31, 2017 was 4.55%, up seven basis points from the same time period in 2016. The tax equivalent yield on average loans for the year ended December 31, 2017 was 4.60%, up two basis points from 2016. Interest income from the investment portfolio was $846,000 for the quarter ended December 31, 2017, reflecting an increase of 33.0% when compared to $636,000 for the same period in 2016. Interest income from the investment portfolio was $3.4 million and $2.7 million for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Average investments for the quarter ended December 31, 2017 were $128.8 million compared to $107.9 million for the same period in 2016. Average investments for the year ended December 31, 2017 were $129.3 million compared to $105.3 million for 2016. The tax equivalent yield on average investments for the quarter ended December 31, 2017 was 3.01%, up 23 basis points from the same time period in 2016. The tax equivalent yield on average investments for the year ended December 31, 2017 was 2.97%, up five basis points from 2016.\nTotal interest expense was $352,000 for the three months ended December 31, 2017 and $220,000 for three months ended December 31, 2016. Total interest expense for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 was $1.1 million. The average cost of interest bearing liabilities increased 10 basis points when comparing the quarter ended December 31, 2017 to the same time period in 2016. The average cost of interest bearing liabilities increased eight basis points when comparing the year ended December 31, 2017 to the same time period in 2016. The average balance of interest bearing liabilities increased $36.9 million from the quarter ended December 31, 2016 to the same period in 2017. The average balance of interest bearing liabilities increased $30.1 million from the year ended December 31, 2016 to the same period in 2017. These increases were the result of the growth in interest bearing deposits.\nThe net interest margin was 4.03% for the quarter ended December 31, 2017. When compared to the quarter ended December 31, 2016, the net interest margin increased two basis points. The net interest margin was 4.09% for the year ended December 31, 2017. When compared to the year ended December 31, 2016, the net interest margin decreased three basis points.\nThe Company's net interest margin is not a measurement under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, but it is a common measure used by the financial services industry to determine how profitably earning assets are funded. The Company's net interest margin is calculated by dividing tax equivalent net interest income by total average earning assets. Tax equivalent net interest income is calculated by grossing up interest income for the amounts that are non-taxable (i.e., municipal income) then subtracting interest expense. The tax rate utilized is 34%.\nNoninterest income was $1.9 million for the quarter ended December 31, 2017, which represented an increase of $283,000 or 17.6% from the $1.6 million for the same period in 2016. This increase was mostly attributed to the receipt of a $320,000 bank owned life insurance(BOLI) benefit during the quarter ended December 31, 2017. Noninterest income was $6.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 and $6.7 million for the same period in 2016. The $320,000 BOLI benefit recognized during the year ended December 31, 2017, helped offset the $108,000 increase in losses realized on the sales of investment securities as well as the decrease in income from fiduciary activities of $117,000 during that same period. The amount of income from fiduciary activities is determined by the number of active accounts and total assets under management. Other operating income decreased $137,000 from the year ended December 31, 2016 to the same period in 2017. The decrease can be attributed almost solely to the adjustment of the interest rate swap derivative contract to fair value for the year ended December 31, 2016. As previously reported, the Company's cash flow hedge was derecognized upon the retirement of the trust preferred capital notes during the third quarter of 2015 and the derivative contract expired on December 1, 2016. An adjustment of the derivative contract to fair value of $148,000 was made for the year ended December 31, 2016 and was recognized through other operating income.\nNoninterest expense increased $428,000, or 7.9%, to $5.8 million for the quarter ended December 31, 2017 from $5.4 million for the quarter ended December 31, 2016. This increase results mostly from the increase in salaries and employee benefits expense, and specifically from the increase in incentive plan expense. Total incentive plan expense for the quarter ended December 31, 2017 was $236,000, reflecting an increase of $130,000 from the same period in 2016. In addition to higher expense associated with the existing incentive plan for employees due to exceeding 2017 corporate goals, the Company had adopted a commercial banker incentive plan for 2017. The expense related to the new commercial banker incentive plan was $64,000 for the quarter ended December 31, 2017. Other operating expense increased $146,000 when comparing the quarter ended December 31, 2017 to the same period in 2016. This increase resulted from rises in various other expense categories including director fees, educational expenses, postage and loan related expenses.\nNoninterest expense increased $538,000 to $23.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 when compared to $22.7 million for the same period in 2016. Much of this increase resulted from the increase in salary and employee benefit expense. Salary and employee benefit expense increased $628,000 when comparing the year ended December 31, 2017 to the same period in 2016. Aside from annual pay increases and adjustments, the majority of this increase results from increased incentive plan expense. Total incentive plan expense for the year ended December 31, 2017 was $812,000, reflecting an increase of $337,000 from the same period in 2016. In addition to higher expense associated with the existing incentive plan for employees due to exceeding 2017 corporate goals, the Company had adopted a commercial banker incentive plan for 2017. The expense related to the new commercial banker incentive plan was $164,000 for the year ended December 31, 2017.\nAsset Quality and Provision for Loan Losses\nNonperforming assets consist of nonaccrual loans, loans 90 days or more past due and still accruing, other real estate owned (foreclosed properties), and repossessed assets. Nonperforming assets decreased from $7.4 million or 1.05% of total assets at December 31, 2016 to $6.4 million or 0.84% of total assets at December 31, 2017. This decrease resulted from both decreases in nonaccrual loans and other real estate owned (foreclosed properties). Total nonaccrual loans totaled $6.3 million at December 31, 2017 and $7.0 million at December 31, 2016. The majority of the nonaccrual loans are secured by real estate and management evaluates the financial condition of these borrowers and the value of any collateral on these loans. The results of these evaluations are used to estimate the amount of losses which may be realized on the disposition of these nonaccrual loans. Loans greater than 90 days past due and still accruing decreased from $8,000 at December 31, 2016 to none at December 31, 2017. Other real estate owned decreased from $370,000 at December 31, 2016 to $106,000 at December 31, 2017.\nThe Company may, under certain circumstances, restructure loans in troubled debt restructurings as a concession to a borrower when the borrower is experiencing financial distress. Formal, standardized loan restructuring programs are not utilized by the Company. Each loan considered for restructuring is evaluated based on customer circumstances and may include modifications to one or more loan provision. Such restructured loans are included in impaired loans, but may not necessarily be nonperforming loans. At December 31, 2017, the Company had 21 troubled debt restructurings totaling $4.4 million. Approximately $4.4 million or 20 loans are performing loans, while the remaining loans are on non-accrual status. At December 31, 2016, the Company had 26 troubled debt restructurings totaling $7.2 million. Approximately $5.7 million or 20 loans were performing loans, while the remaining loans are on non-accrual status.\nThe Company realized $98,000 in net charge offs for the quarter ended December 31, 2017 versus net charge offs of $11,000 for the three months ended December 31, 2016. Provisions for loan losses for the three months ended December 31, 2017 were $134,000 while the Company recognized a negative provision for loan losses totaling $142,000 for the quarter ended December 31, 2016. Negative provisions for loan losses of $625,000 and $188,000 were recorded for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The ratio of allowance for loan losses to total loans was 0.78% at December 31, 2017 and 0.87% at December 31, 2016. The ratio of allowance for loan losses to total nonaccrual loans was 69.59% at December 31, 2017 and 64.44% at December 31, 2016. The amount of provision for loan losses reflects the results of the Bank's analysis used to determine the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses. Management's judgment in determining the level of the allowance is based on evaluations of the collectability of loans while taking into consideration such factors as trends in delinquencies and charge-offs, changes in the nature and volume of the loan portfolio, current economic conditions that may affect a borrower's ability to repay and the value of collateral, overall portfolio quality and review of specific potential losses. The Company is committed to maintaining an allowance at a level that adequately reflects the risk inherent in the loan portfolio.\nTotal Consolidated Assets\nTotal consolidated assets of the Company at December 31, 2017 were $765.8 million, which represented an increase of $65.6 million or 9.37% from total assets of $700.1 million at December 31, 2016. Total loans increased $51.9 million from $516.9 million at December 31, 2016 to $568.8 million at December 31, 2017. Total securities increased $13.3 million from $120.3 million at December 31, 2016, to $133.7 million at December 31, 2017.\nDeposits and Other Borrowings\nTotal deposits increased $59.5 million to $663.4 million at December 31, 2017 from $603.9 million at December 31, 2016. The Company had no outstanding borrowings from the Federal Home Loan Bank of Atlanta at December 31, 2017 and 2016.\nEquity\nShareholders' equity was $83.8 million at December 31, 2017 and $79.4 million at December 31, 2016. The book value of the Company at December 31, 2017 was $24.40 per common share. Total common shares outstanding were 3,449,027 at December 31, 2017. On January 17, 2018, the board of directors declared a $0.23 per common share cash dividend for shareholders of record as of February 2, 2018 and payable on February 16, 2018.\nCertain information contained in this discussion may include \"forward-looking statements\" within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. These forward-looking statements relate to the Company's future operations and are generally identified by phrases such as \"the Company expects,\" \"the Company believes\" or words of similar import. Although the Company believes that its expectations with respect to the forward-looking statements are based upon reliable assumptions within the bounds of its knowledge of its business and operations, there can be no assurance that actual results, performance or achievements of the Company will not differ materially from any future results, performance or achievements expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements.

Tax equivalent interest income is calculated by grossing up interest income for the amounts that are non-taxable (i.e., municipal income) then subtracting interest expense. The rate utilized is 34%. See the table below for the quarterly tax equivalent net interest income and the reconciliation of net interest income to tax equivalent net interest income. The Company's net interest margin is a common measure used by the financial service industry to determine how profitable earning assets are funded. Because the Company earns a fair amount of nontaxable interest income due to the mix of securities in its investment security portfolio, net interest income for the ratio is calculated on a tax equivalent basis as described above.\n(2)\nThe efficiency ratio is not a measurement under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. It is calculated by dividing non-interest expense by the sum of tax equivalent net interest income and non-interest income excluding gains and losses on the investment portfolio and sales of repossessed assets. The tax rate utilized is 34%. See the table below for the quarterly tax equivalent net interest income and a reconciliation of net interest income to tax equivalent net interest income. The Company calculates this ratio in order to evaluate its overhead structure or how effectively it is operating. An increase in the ratio from period to period indicates the Company is losing a larger percentage of its income to expenses. The Company believes that the efficiency ratio is a reasonable measure of profitability.\nEAGLE FINANCIAL SERVICES, INC.\nSELECTED FINANCIAL DATA BY QUARTER\n4Q17\n3Q17\n2Q17\n1Q17\n4Q16\nBALANCE SHEET RATIOS\nLoans to deposits\n85.74%\n85.57%\n87.69%\n83.61%\n85.60%\nAverage interest-earning assets to\naverage-interest bearing liabilities\n165.83%\n162.10%\n162.04%\n162.59%\n164.25%\nPER SHARE DATA\nDividends\n$ 0.22\n$ 0.22\n$ 0.22\n$ 0.22\n$ 0.22\nBook value\n24.40\n24.31\n24.02\n23.32\n23.01\nTangible book value\n24.40\n24.31\n24.02\n23.32\n23.10\nSHARE PRICE DATA\nClosing price\n$ 32.00\n$ 29.25\n$ 31.25\n$ 28.40\n$ 25.75\nDiluted earnings multiple(1)\n16.33\n12.61\n13.47\n12.03\n12.38\nBook value multiple(2)\n1.31\n1.20\n1.30\n1.22\n1.12\nCOMMON STOCK DATA\nOutstanding shares at end of period\n3,449,027\n3,456,430\n3,481,946\n3,476,553\n3,468,243\nWeighted average shares outstanding\n3,468,275\n3,469,372\n3,474,628\n3,478,053\n3,477,020\nWeighted average shares outstanding, diluted\n3,468,275\n3,469,372\n3,474,628\n3,478,053\n3,477,020\nCAPITAL RATIOS\nTotal equity to total assets\n10.95%\n11.31%\n11.18%\n11.42%\n11.34%\nCREDIT QUALITY\nNet charge-offs to average loans\n0.07%\n-0.03%\n-0.16%\n-0.34%\n0.01%\nTotal non-performing loans to total loans\n1.11%\n0.92%\n1.01%\n1.23%\n1.35%\nTotal non-performing assets to total assets\n0.84%\n0.71%\n0.77%\n0.91%\n1.05%\nNon-accrual loans to:\ntotal loans\n1.11%\n0.92%\n1.01%\n1.23%\n1.35%\ntotal assets\n0.83%\n0.69%\n0.75%\n0.90%\n1.00%\nAllowance for loan losses to:\ntotal loans\n0.78%\n0.81%\n0.80%\n0.85%\n0.87%\nnon-performing assets\n68.44%\n85.30%\n77.22%\n68.59%\n61.13%\nnon-accrual loans\n69.59%\n87.40%\n78.68%\n69.74%\n64.44%\nNON-PERFORMING ASSETS:\n(dollars in thousands)\nLoans delinquent over 90 days\n$ -\n$ 19\n$ -\n$ -\n$ 8\nNon-accrual loans\n6,339\n5,086\n5,601\n6,335\n6,991\nOther real estate owned and repossessed assets\n106\n106\n106\n106\n370\nNET LOAN CHARGE-OFFS (RECOVERIES):\n(dollars in thousands)\nLoans charged off\n$ 160\n$ 70\n$ 67\n$ 62\n$ 135\n(Recoveries)\n(62)\n(110)\n(286)\n(502)\n(124)\nNet charge-offs (recoveries)\n98\n(40)\n(219)\n(440)\n11\nPROVISION FOR LOAN LOSSES (dollars in thousands)\n$ 134\n$ (2)\n$ (230)\n$ (527)\n$ (142)\nALLOWANCE FOR LOAN LOSS SUMMARY\n(dollars in thousands)\nBalance at the beginning of period\n$ 4,375\n$ 4,437\n$ 4,417\n$ 4,505\n$ 4,658\nProvision\n134\n(2)\n(230)\n(527)\n(142)\nNet charge-offs (recoveries)\n98\n(40)\n(150)\n(439)\n11\nBalance at the end of period\n$ 4,411\n$ 4,375\n$ 4,337\n$ 4,417\n$ 4,505\n(1)\nThe diluted earnings multiple (or price earnings ratio) is calculated by dividing the period's closing market price per share by total equity per weighted average shares outstanding, diluted for the period.
