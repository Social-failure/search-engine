REUTERS/Edgar Su He played his part in entertaining exchanges but Federer, sporting a diagonal pink stripe on his immaculate white kit, was in one of those moods when he could strike winners at will.\nHe broke Bedene’s serve in the fourth game of the first set in which he conceded only three points on his serve.\nFederer pounced immediately at the start of the second, producing a fizzing backhand return before leaping high to smash away Bedene’s defensive lob.\nSlideshow (3 Images) The winners began to pile up and one member of the sell-out crowd yelled “Give him a chance Rog” late on.\nBut Federer was in no mood to hang around and finished the match on Bedene’s serve when his opponent netted a backhand.\n“I am hoping for another good year,” Federer, who also won Wimbledon for a record eighth time in 2017, said on court.\n“I am not sure it will go as well (as 2017) because I‘m a year older, Rafa’s looking in tip-top shape and others guys are coming back.”\nHis next opponent will be Germany’s Jan-Lennard Struff on Thursday when temperatures in Melbourne are expected to climb to about 40 degrees centigrade.\n“I’ll ask for a night match just because I played night tonight. It’s just easier, to be honest, rather than going from night to day to night to day to night to day,” Federer said.\nReporting by Martyn Herman, editing by Ed Osmond\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-16T12:20:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-16T12:36:07.022+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
