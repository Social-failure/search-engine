Activists dismiss that as implausible. \n“Oplan Tokhang”, where police visit homes of users and dealers and seek their surrender, is to resume soon, Carlos said, adding that it had brought positive results. \nHe said more than 1.3 million drugs users had turned themselves in seeking rehabilitation and police had made 119,361 arrests. \nThe authorities have seized more than two and a half tonnes of the methamphetamine “shabu”, with a street value of 13.2 billion pesos (187 million pounds).
