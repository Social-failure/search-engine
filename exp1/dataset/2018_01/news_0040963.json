Umpire Ian Gould turned down the appeal and South Africa did not review the decision. \nHad they done so, replays showed the ball was crashing into leg-stump and Gould would have been forced to overturn his decision. \nSouth Africa have made just one change for the match with all-rounder Andile Phehlukwayo replacing spinner Keshav Maharaj. India have made two changes as batsman Ajinkya Rahane and seamer Bhuvneshwar Kumar take over from Rohit Sharma and Ravichandran Ashwin respectively. \nThe home side have already claimed the series with an unassailable 2-0 lead, but are chasing a first ever clean-sweep against India.
