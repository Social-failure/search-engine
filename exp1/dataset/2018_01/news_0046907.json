I know I’ve let people down,” Paul says in the video. “But what happens when you’re given an opportunity to help make a difference in the world?” \nPaul’s upcoming projects were put on hold earlier this month after he posted a video that appeared to show the body of a suicide victim hanging from a tree in Japan’s Aokigahara forest, which is colloquially known as “Suicide Forest.” He was also temporarily yanked from YouTube’s premium advertising service. \nThe vlogger, who removed the video less than a day after it was posted, apologized for his actions , writing on Twitter that, “I didn’t do it for views. I get views. I did it because I thought I could make a positive ripple on the internet, not cause a monsoon of negativity.” SPONSORED FINANCIAL CONTENT ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-25T09:43:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-25T18:13:23.002+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
