FFO is a performance measure that is standard in the REIT business. We believe FFO provides investors with additional information concerning our operating performance and a basis to compare our performance with those of other REITs. We also use these measures internally to monitor the operating performance of our portfolio. Our computation of these non-GAAP measures may not be the same as similar measures reported by other REITs.\nWe determine FFO based upon the definition set forth by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts (\"NAREIT\"). We determine FFO to be our share of consolidated net income computed in accordance with GAAP, excluding real estate related depreciation and amortization, excluding gains and losses from extraordinary items, excluding gains and losses from the sales or disposals of, or any impairment charges related to, previously depreciated retail operating properties, plus the allocable portion of FFO of unconsolidated joint ventures based upon economic ownership interest, and all determined on a consistent basis in accordance with GAAP.\nWe have adopted NAREIT's clarification of the definition of FFO that requires it to include the effects of nonrecurring items not classified as extraordinary, cumulative effect of accounting changes, or a gain or loss resulting from the sale or disposal of, or any impairment charges relating to, previously depreciated retail operating properties. We include in FFO gains and losses realized from the sale of land, outlot buildings, marketable and non-marketable securities, and investment holdings of non-retail real estate. However, you should understand that FFO does not represent cash flow from operations as defined by GAAP, should not be considered as an alternative to net income determined in accordance with GAAP as a measure of operating performance, and is not an alternative to cash flows as a measure of liquidity.\n(D)\nIncludes our share of:\n-\nGains on land sales of $2.2 million and $8.8 million for the three months ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively, and $12.3 million and $14.0 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.\n-\nStraight-line adjustments increased income by $7.4 million and $12.5 million for the three months ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively, and $34.5 million and $56.8 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.\n-\nAmortization of fair market value of leases from acquisitions increased income by $1.4 million and $2.3 million for the three months ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively, and $6.0 million and $9.6 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.\n-\nDebt premium amortization of $0.0 million and $5.1 million for the three months ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively, and $0.2 million and $19.0 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.\n(E)\nGain upon acquisition of controlling interests and sale or disposal of assets and interests in unconsolidated entities for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2016 was $8.1 million and $84.6 million, respectively.
