In the real-estate world, buyers pay a premium for a famous property only to see their home’s value plunge when its history is debunked. To protect their investment, buyers are increasingly turning to historians, architectural experts and nonprofit foundations to authenticate the provenance of the property. \n“Buyers want a home with a history or architectural pedigree. Realtors and sellers understand this,” says Ms. McNeill, who declined to say how much she charges for her research. “In today’s competitive and sometimes frenzied marketplace, none of the parties are always as diligent as they should be in researching attribution.” Ms. McNeill is also a senior historian at wealth management firm Ascent Private Capital Management of U.S. Bank. This Bay Area home (also seen at top) that was once owned by venture capitalist Tom Perkins was marketed in 2016 as having been designed by architect Julia Morgan with George Kelham.\nJacob Elliott Photography \nDanielle Chavanon and Isobel Wiener of Sotheby’s International Realty, who had listed the Perkins property, admit they aren’t historians. They say they described the property as a Morgan after seeing it listed as one of her undocumented works in a book by the late architectural historian Sara Holmes Boutelle. The book was provided by Mr. Perkins’s heirs, they say; Mr. Perkins died in 2016. The agents declined further comment. \nWhen it comes to a name-brand architect, there are more than bragging rights at stake. Nina Hatvany, a luxury agent with Pacific Union International in San Francisco, says having Ms. Morgan’s name attached to a listing could add a 5% to 10% pricing premium to a property. Listed for $16.5 million in September 2016, the Belvedere home sold for $14.46 million in March—by Ms. Chavanon and Ms. Wiener—and a second time last year for $14.25 million by another agent. Mr. Perkins’s estate didn’t respond to requests for comment; the home’s current owners couldn’t be reached for comment. An unusually-shaped window in the bedroom was out of character with Ms. Morgan’s usual use of strong, clean lines and angles, Ms. McNeill says.\nJacob Elliott Photography \nLittle wonder that Morgans tend to multiply. Daniella Thompson, former president of the Berkeley Architectural Heritage Association, says the organization was asked by prospective buyers to research a small Craftsman-style home in Berkeley that was marketed as a Morgan. Ms. Thompson says she knew straightaway the claim was false—she had researched the home previously and knew it was by Edna Deakin, another female contemporary of Ms. Morgan’s. \nThe listing agent, Galina Plizga, doesn’t dispute Ms. Thompson’s conclusions—her only evidence of the home’s Morgan provenance was a 2011 rental listing—so she removed the Morgan claim before the home sold. The home sold for $1.37 million last year, public records show. “I have no idea how Julia Morgan got tied up in it, but it doesn’t surprise me since everyone seems to want to claim their house is by Julia Morgan,” Ms. Thompson says. \nWhile the Bay Area is replete with Morgans, in Los Angeles the coveted architect is Paul Williams, the first African-American to be admitted to the American Institute of Architects . It can often be difficult to determine the provenance of a possible Paul Williams home, since records of his work aren’t exhaustive and he designed in many different styles. Jeff Hyland of Beverly Hills-based brokerage Hilton & Hyland says that, when in doubt, agents default to describing homes they believe to be designed by Mr. Williams as being “in the style of Paul Williams.” \nFor years, locals believed a 19th-century Newport, R.I., estate was designed by noted architecture firm McKim Mead & White, the same company behind the design of New York’s original Pennsylvania Station. McKim Mead & White historian Richard Guy Wilson, a professor at the University of Virginia, says he believes they were wrong. He traced the mistake to a 1952 book titled “The Architectural Heritage of Newport, Rhode Island: 1640-1915.” \nAfter the book was published, “the information got passed around town until it became as good as fact,” says Mr. Wilson, who identifies the actual architect as Dudley Newton. \nEven in the case of famed architect Frank Lloyd Wright, whose projects are faithfully and almost exhaustively documented by scholars, disputes occur. That may be due to the fact that the economic incentive to document a Wright is considerable. “It maybe raises a building’s value by a factor of five or more,” says William Allin Storrer, a Wright historian. “A $160,000 home would be worth $1.5 million if it was by Wright.” \nJoel Hoglund, communications director at the Frank Lloyd Wright Building Conservancy in Chicago, estimates that his organization is contacted every couple of months by homeowners who believe their property may be a Wright. The conservancy checks such inquiries against its internal database of all Wright structures. “While discovery of a previously unknown Frank Lloyd Wright design is unlikely, it is not impossible,” he says. A cottage on the Flying L Guest Ranch, a large ranch resort in Bandera, Texas\nAmy Mikler for The Wall Street Journal \nSusan Jenkins, owner of Flying L Guest Ranch, a large ranch resort in Bandera, Texas, near San Antonio, says that her years of research show that cottages on the 1940s-era property were designed by Mr. Wright. While she has no original plans, she found several historical references to Mr. Wright’s involvement in local publications, including a 1963 mention in “The Dude Wrangler,” a publication for dude-ranch operators, as well as mentions in the Bandera Bulletin and the San Antonio Express that same year. She also points to clues such as the unusual use of precast cinder blocks made of seashells. She says Mr. Wright previously used sand and crushed coquina shells in the construction of another project, Florida Southern University in 1941. Susan Jenkins and her husband Jody Jenkins, owners of the Flying L Guest Ranch\nAmy Mikler for The Wall Street Journal \nMr. Storrer, the Wright historian, visited the property at Ms. Jenkins’s behest earlier this year. He argues there is no solid evidence to prove the cottages’ provenance. “I went there already knowing it wasn’t by Wright,” Mr. Storrer says, adding that he could tell from the floor plans. “I have a phrase that I’m not popular for: ‘Those who have eyes and cannot see should not advertise their ignorance.’ I don’t want to insult these homeowners, but I do want to clarify.” Ms. Jenkins says she believes Mr. Storrer is wrong. Pat Wisialowski, who formerly owned a Wright home in Shorewood, Wis. says interest in her home rose after its provenance was discovered by a local historian.\nSara Stathas for The Wall Street Journal \nPat Wisialowski, who formerly owned a Wright home in Shorewood, Wis., says the interest in her home rose after its provenance was discovered by a local historian.
