He said he continued to stick to a forecast of $50 to $60 per barrel for 2018.\nReporting by Darya Korsunskaya and Katya Golubkova; Writing by Polina Ivanova; Editing by Louise Heavens and Edmund Blair\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-16T14:24:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-16T14:40:21.011+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
