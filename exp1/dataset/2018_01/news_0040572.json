That was better than some analysts had predicted before the company announced full-year results.\n“I can definitely see a path to between $4 billion and $5 billion combined,” Paul Hudson, the Swiss drugmaker’s pharmeuticals unit head, said on Wednesday. The company has previously predicted Entresto peak sales of around $5 billion.
