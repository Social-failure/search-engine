But cash-poor PDVSA has been reluctant to invest some $1.5 billion that Curacao authorities requested several years ago to modernize the 335,000 barrel-per-day facility.\nReporting by Sailu Urribarri; Writing by Alexandra Ulmer; Editing by Jeffrey Benkoe\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-01-02T23:33:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-02T18:17:01.003+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
