It is up to the minister to balance safety and certainty of supply,” it said. \nThe mines supervisor is one of the parties advising the minister, with gas company Gasunie tasked to determine the production level needed to make sure supply can meet demand. \nThe government has lowered output from Groningen several times in recent years, as decades of extraction have triggered dozens of earthquakes each year in the region, causing damage to thousands of homes and buildings. \nMonday’s 3.4 tremor was the largest in years and prompted NAM to propose a cut in production, without naming a specific level. \nBut lowering output will not put an end to all earthquakes, NAM said, as a fluctuation in production levels increases seismic risks. \nNAM, a joint venture between Royal Dutch Shell and Exxon Mobil, said that, as a basic rule, a 10 percent cut could prevent two or three earthquakes with a magnitude of at least 1.5 each year. \nProduction at Groningen was lowered by 10 percent last October to 21.6 billion cubic metres (bcm) per year and the government has agreed to reduce that to around 20 bcm by 2021. Production stood at 54 bcm in 2013. \nPossibilities for further cuts are limited in the short run, as almost all Dutch households use the low-calorific gas produced in Groningen. \nImported high-calorific gas can be adapted for use in the Netherlands, but the facilities need to do this are already working near full capacity.
