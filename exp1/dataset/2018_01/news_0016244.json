So far, no fatalities or injuries have been reported,” a local official told Iranian TV. \nAftershocks continued to be felt in central Iraq an hour after the initial tremor, causing residents to exit buildings in a hurry. \nIraqi state TV said there were no reports of significant damage or fatalities in Baghdad or the central provinces of Wasit and Diyala where the tremor was also felt. Electricity and internet services were not interrupted in the Iraqi capital. \nThe quake’s magnitude was 5.5, according to the United States Geological Survey.
