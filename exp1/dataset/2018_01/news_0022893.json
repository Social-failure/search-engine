There was no immediate comment from the United Nations. \nThe attack was described by U.N. Secretary General Antonio Guterres as the worst on the world body in recent history. \nSet up in 2010, the U.N. peacekeeping mission in Congo called MONUSCO is the global body’s largest but has struggled to neutralize a patchwork of rebel and militia factions in eastern Congo and has previously drawn criticism from Museveni. \nA few days after the ADF attack, Uganda carried out air and artillery strikes on the group’s camps. Kampala said it had intelligence the rebels were planning hostile acts against it. \nThe East African country, which has a history of meddling in lawless eastern Congo, is eager to prevent the ADF from re-entering Uganda’s oil-rich western region as the resulting insecurity could force out investors. \nUganda is aiming to start pumping crude in its west in 2020.
