But analysts think its sales will rise 6.4 percent in 2018 to $2.55 billion. \nMeanwhile, Facebook sales are seen surging 33 percent to $53.6 billion in 2018, while Google parent Alphabet is expected to post revenue of $131 billion, or year-over-year growth of 19 percent. \nFacebook shares fell as much as 4 percent on heavier-than-usual volume after it said it would show fewer news items and videos in its News Feed, in favor of more content from users' friends. \nCNBC's Sara Salinas contributed to this report.
