We just wanted to build a product that people used,\" Koum said late Wednesday, during an onstage panel discussion that preceded an advance screening of a new documentary called \"Silicon Valley: The Untold Story.\"\nThe app didn't take off right away, even though it was accepted into Apple's App Store, Koum recounted.\n\"We were so excited when it launched,\" he said. \"And so disappointed when no one used it.\"\nThat soon changed, however.\nBy 2014, WhatsApp, thanks to its easy-to-use interface and uncluttered design, had more than 400 million users globally.\nCorporate suitors like Facebook soon came calling.\n'All a blur' When panel moderator Michael Malone asked Koum what he remembered most about the day he agreed to sell the company in early 2014, Koum drew a blank.\n\"It was all a blur.

We want to convince them,\" Koum replied. \"We still have problems to solve.\"\nWhen asked by CNBC after the panel what it was like since Acton left the company last year, Koum answered, \"We miss Brian.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-19T18:09:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-19T18:23:19.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
