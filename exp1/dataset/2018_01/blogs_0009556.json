If we or others find otherwise based on further review, we will report it immediately. Information published that is contrary to this statement is categorically false. Due to the classified nature of the payload, no further comment is possible.\n\"Since the data reviewed so far indicates that no design, operational or other changes are needed, we do not anticipate any impact on the upcoming launch schedule.\"\nSpaceX will still execute its scheduled \"static fire\" test of the Falcon Heavy rocket at another Cape Canaveral launchpad, Shotwell said. Static fire tests tests the rocket's boosters full thrust, as well as other functions on the rocket and ground support systems. The highly anticipated rocket, which is SpaceX's largest, will take its maiden flight soon after that, she said.\nSpaceX also plans to launch another Falcon 9 (F9) for communications provider SES and the Luxembourg government from another launchpad (SLC-40) at Cape Canaveral in three weeks.\nThe satellite was reportedly lost, possibly falling back into the atmosphere, according to The Wall Street Journal, citing unnamed sources.\nVery little was known about the mission at all, such as the cost of the satellite and its exact purpose. This was SpaceX's third launch for the U.S. military, according to Ars Technica .\nSpaceX has driven down the costs of launching rockets, but has also had some high-profile failures, including an explosion on a launch pad in 2016 that claimed a communications satellite that cost an estimated $300 million to build.\nThe Falcon 9 rocket landed safely after the launch.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-09T17:35:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-09T17:39:07.011+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
