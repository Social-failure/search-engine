Four times he holed putts from eight feet or longer, including an 11-footer at the par-five 18th, which conjured up memories from a decade ago. \nWoods sank a putt from much the same distance at the 72nd hole of the 2008 U.S. Open to get into a playoff which he won.

Both had completed seven holes. \nAustralian former world number one Jason Day charged within one stroke of the lead approaching the turn, while Swede Alex Noren and Americans Michael Kim and Tony Finau were also 10 under.
