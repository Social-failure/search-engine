That was despite-wide ranging concerns about the Chinese economy, including high debt levels, asset bubbles and a slowdown in industrial sectors.\nIn December, exports rose 10.9 percent from a year ago, while imports rose 4.5 percent.\nEconomists polled by Reuters expected dollar-denominated exports to rise 9.1 percent from a year ago in December, slowing from the 12.3 percent growth in November.\nDollar-denominated import growth, meanwhile, is seen at 13 percent in December against a 17.7 percent growth in November, the economists forecast.
