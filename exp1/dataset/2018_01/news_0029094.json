There is some stability in the market with a little bit of buying,” said Hitesh Agarwal, EVP and Head – Retail Research, Religare Securities Ltd.\nThe broader NSE index was up 0.27 percent at 10,729.00 as of 0555 GMT, while the benchmark BSE index was 0.29 percent higher at 34,873.21.\nInfosys led gains on the NSE index, surging as much as 3.5 percent in its eighth session of gains. Tata Consultancy Services Ltd rose 2.6 percent to hit a record high.\nThe Nifty IT index climbed as much as 1.8 percent.\n“Value-buying along with the sharp fall in the rupee yesterday is helping support IT stocks. Rupee weakening is always good for IT companies as they are exposed to the United States for revenues,” Agarwal said.\nPrivate lenders also rose, with ICICI Bank gaining as much as 3 percent and Axis Bank Ltd up 2 percent.\nThe Nifty private bank index rose 0.7 percent to notch up another peak this week.\nMulti Commodity Exchange of India Ltd slid as much as 5.8 percent to its lowest level since April 21, 2016 after posting a 45 percent drop in Dec-qtr consol net profit.\nReporting by Jessica Kuruthukulangara in Bengaluru; Editing by Biju Dwarakanath\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-01-17T14:15:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-18T16:04:19.023+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
