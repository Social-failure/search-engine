China says the exercises are routine.\nThe Chinese aircraft carrier the Liaoning has this month sailed twice through the Taiwan Strait, the narrow stretch of water separating the two sides.\nWu said a carrier group led by the Liaoning had recently conducted training in accordance with an annual training schedule, to test the performance of equipment. He give no other details.\nChina considers proudly democratic Taiwan to be its sacred territory and has never renounced the use of force to bring it under Chinese control.\nReporting by Ben Blanchard; Editing by Nick Macfie\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-01-25T18:44:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-25T12:52:27.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
