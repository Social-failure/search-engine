Every now and again a retail brand goes out there and changes the market, the Action story has a great track record and continues to grow,” a senior banker said.\nThe financing also includes a €125m six-year revolving credit facility to replace an existing €75m RCF.\nLenders have been asked to commit to the financing by February. S&P and Moody’s corporate and facility ratings remain unchanged at B+/B1 with stable outlooks.\nAction was last in the marker in May 2017 when it repriced its €1.6bn TLB to 350bp over Euribor, from 425bp. That loan was issued with a 0% floor at par and included 101 soft-call protection for six months.\nIt is unclear whether pricing on the new term loan will remain in line with existing levels or price tighter or wider. Pricing will emerge at the bank meeting.\nAction, owned by 3i since 2011, has nearly 1,100 stores across seven European countries. It had net sales of 2016 of €2.7bn.
