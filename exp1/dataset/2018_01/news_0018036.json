They range in age from 2 to 62. \nAnother 900 emergency personnel arrived this weekend to join the relief effort conducted by more than 2,100 personnel from local, state and federal agencies, including the U.S. Coast Guard, the U.S. Navy and the American Red Cross. \nThe ramped-up rescue effort is in response to urgent requests for additional manpower made earlier in the week. \nThe disaster struck on Tuesday after heavy rains soaked the area near Montecito, north of Los Angeles, where vegetation had been denuded by the largest wildfire in California’s history. \nSodden hillsides gave way, unleashing a torrent of mud, water, uprooted trees and boulders onto the valley below and killing victims aged from 3 to 89. \nThe destruction covered 30 square miles (78 square km), the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection said, and forced the partial closure of one of California’s most celebrated coastal roads, Highway 101. \nOfficials ordered residents in most of the southeastern corner of Montecito, which is east of Santa Barbara, to leave their homes for what was likely to be one or two weeks. \nMany fled to nearby Carpinteria, where local resident Tessa Nash said more than a few were communicating via a Facebook page called Carpinteria Swap, which is usually focused on the buying and selling of secondhand goods. \nThese days, Nash said, it carries information about community-led blood drives and transportation tips. \n“We’re really joined together,” she said. “We’re affected here in Carpinteria in the sense that we’re taking these people in and a lot of people are out of work because they can’t travel. It’s a trickle-down effect.” Additional reporting by Keith Coffman in Denver, Barbara Goldberg in New York, Ian Simpson in Washington and Rich McKay in Atlanta.; Editing by Diane Craft and Louise Heavens", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-14T12:23:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-14T12:50:20.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
