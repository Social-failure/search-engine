Microsoft declined to comment. \nShares in Intel were down by 3.4 percent in early U.S. trading following the report. \nThe Register said programmers working on the Linux open-source operating system were overhauling the affected memory areas, while Microsoft Corp ( MSFT.O ) was expected to issue a Windows patch next Tuesday. \n\"Crucially, these updates to both Linux and Windows will incur a performance hit on Intel products,\" The Register wrote ( bit.ly/2CsRxkj ). \n“The effects are being benchmarked, however we are looking at a ballpark figure of a five to 30 percent slowdown, depending on the task and the processor model.” \nIt was not immediately clear whether Intel would face any significant financial liability arising from the reported flaw. \n“The current Intel problem, if true, would likely not require CPU replacement in our opinion. However the situation is fluid,” Hans Mosesmann of Rosenblatt Securities in New York said in a note. \nIntel may end up having to indemnify harm or costs incurred by customers, and could also lose customers and faces a hit to its reputation, he added. AMD NOT AFFECTED \nCompeting chip maker AMD ( AMD.O ) has told Linux developers by email that its chips are not vulnerable to the types of attacks that the fix for the Intel chip is intended to address by isolating the kernel memory, The Register said. \nShares in AMD jumped by 7.2 percent in early trade on Wednesday. \nThe bug is likely to affect major cloud computing platforms such as Amazon ( AMZN.O ) EC2, Microsoft Azure and Google ( GOOGL.O ) Compute Engine, according to one software blogger cited by The Register. \nMicrosoft Azure is due to undergo a maintenance reboot on Jan. 10 while Amazon Web Services has also advised customers via email to expect a major security update this Friday. \nThe Register also said that similar operating systems, such as Apple’s ( AAPL.O ) 64-bit macOS operating system, would need to be updated. \nThe Linux patches are based on work by researchers from the Graz University of Technology in Austria who came up with a way to split kernel and user memory spaces to eliminate the security vulnerability.
