The economy bounced back after shrinking in the third quarter due to the impact of storms and two devastating earthquakes.\nCompared to the same quarter a year earlier, the economy grew by 1.8 percent in unadjusted terms, the agency said. In unadjusted terms, the economy grew 2.1 percent in 2017 compared to the prior year, the agency said.
