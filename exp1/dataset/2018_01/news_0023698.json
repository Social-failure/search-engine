REUTERS/Marko Djurica \nScandinavian rivals Sweden and Norway also won to boost their hopes of reaching the main round on a day of spectacular action in the preliminary pools. \nWith their confidence high after a 32-22 win over Serbia, the Croatians brushed aside Iceland 29-22 thanks to a superb second-half performance in the cauldron of Split’s Spaladium Arena. \nWith the scores tied at 14-14 early in the second half, the Croatians pulled away after engineering a 5-0 run as playmaker Luka Cindric pulled the strings in attack and netted a game-high seven goals. \nFormer world and Olympic champions Croatia, seeking their first European title, were also helped by a string of good saves by reserve goalkeeper Ivan Stevanovic.
