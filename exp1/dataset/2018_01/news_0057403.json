For the twelve months ended December 31, 2017, the corporation reported net income of $174,000 or $0.06 per share compared to net income of $1,297,000 or $0.40 per share for the same period in 2016. The net loss is directly attributable to the Tax Cut and Jobs Act (H.R. 1) signed into law on December 22, 2017. The change in tax law resulted in a charge to federal income tax expense of $1.69 million for 2017.\nJ. Grant Smith, CEO, said, \"Despite the year end charge to reduce the Corporation’s deferred tax asset per the change in tax law, the Corporation was on pace for another outstanding year. Pre-tax income grew by 29% year over year. While at the same time, balance sheet fundamentals continue to be outstanding. We expect our strong performance will continue throughout 2018. Excellent asset quality, combined with good expense control and very good core deposits will help to further enhance the Corporation’s performance going forward.”\nOperating Results\nThe Corporation’s net interest income increased slightly to $1,820,000 for the quarter ended December 31, 2017 compared to $1,695,000 for the same period ended December 31, 2016. This represents an increase of $125,000 or 7.37% quarter over quarter. This increase is due to the growth in our loan portfolio. The net interest margin of the Bank remains above its peer group average ending at 3.85% for the quarter ended December 31, 2017.\nNoninterest income decreased during the fourth quarter of 2017 when compared to the fourth quarter of 2016. The Corporation posted $59,000 for the quarter compared to $243,000 for the quarter ended December 31, 2016, a decrease of $184,000 or 75.72%. The decrease is mostly attributable to gains realized on the sale of SBA loans in 2016. Noninterest expense increased, ending the fourth quarter at $1,324,000 compared to $1,107,000 for the same period ended December 31, 2016, an increase of $217,000 or 19.60%. However, year-to-date the Corporation’s noninterest expense for 2017 was 1.17% or $58,000 higher at $5,002,000 compared to $4,944,000 in 2016.\nBalance Sheet\nTotal assets at December 31, 2017 were $193,311,000 compared to $179,007,000 at December 31, 2016, an increase of $14,304,000 or 7.99%. The increase in assets is due to an increase of loans.\nGross loans increased $20,699,000 from $151,887,000 at December 31, 2016, to $172,586,000 at December 31, 2017, an increase of 13.63%.
