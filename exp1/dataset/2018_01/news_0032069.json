Strong results by ASML had lifted investors’ spirits on the industry during the previous session. \nTelecoms were the worst performing sector, with BT and Vodafone losing 1.3 percent and 1.8 percent respectively. \nIn the UK, Whitbread rose 2.3 percent despite reporting tough consumer market conditions after sources told Reuters that activist investor Sachem Head was asking Britain’s biggest hotel and coffee shop operator to consider splitting off the Costa Coffee chain. \n“The pressure on the UK high street may indeed make this the time for Whitbread to at least look at its options. Break up rumours could support the share price even in the face of weaker LFL (like-for-like) sales growth”, said ETX Capital senior market analyst Neil Wilson. \nPrimark owner Associated British Foods was down almost 4 percent after saying that revenues and profits at its sugar business would fall by more than previously expected due to lower European Union sugar prices. \nIn Belgium, Ablynx rose 1.3 percent after its largest shareholder said Denmark’s Novo Nordisk would need to raise its offer if it wanted to buy the Belgian biotech group.
