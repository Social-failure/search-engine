The estimate is based on current accounting guidance and the company’s net deferred tax assets as of Sept. 30, 2017, and the final amount will depend on fourth quarter 2017 financial results. The charge will not affect core earnings, a non-GAAP financial measure. Although the new U.S. tax law reduces the company’s net deferred tax asset position, the company expects a net favorable future economic impact from both the lower corporate income tax rate and the repeal and refunding of the corporate alternative minimum tax credits.\nIn addition, the company estimates that fourth quarter financial results will include approximately $180 million of net catastrophe losses, before tax, or $117 million, after tax. This estimate includes the benefit of favorable loss reserve development on prior quarter 2017 catastrophes and anticipated reinsurance recoveries for fourth quarter 2017 catastrophe losses ceded to the company’s 2017 property catastrophe aggregate reinsurance treaty. Catastrophe losses in fourth quarter 2017 were primarily in the Personal Lines segment and from wildfires in California, with total estimated gross losses of $307 million, before tax, and before expected reinsurance recoveries.\nThe Hartford will release its fourth quarter 2017 financial results, as well as its 2018 outlook for selected business metrics, following the close of the market on Thursday, Feb. 8, 2018. The company will host a webcast at 9 a.m. EST on Friday, Feb. 9, to discuss the results and 2018 outlook. The webcast, along with an audio replay and transcript, will be available for at least one year on the investor relations section of the company’s website, https://ir.thehartford.com .\nAbout The Hartford\nThe Hartford is a leader in property and casualty insurance, group benefits and mutual funds.
