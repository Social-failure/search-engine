If they surge higher it shows that the market is expecting inflation to pick up. This can be a sign of a healthy economy, but some analysts warn that there is a limit to this. Surging inflation can cause central banks to lower interest rates and can raise questions on when the next recession will hit.\nOn this basis, investors would likely change their investments and remove money from stock markets.\nshow chapters A 'line in the sand' on bond yields draws bears and bulls 15 Hours Ago | 01:27 \"If yields are rising, the economy is overheating and therefore getting nearer to off the cycle,\" Bill Blain, strategist and head of capital markets at Mint Partners, told CNBC via email.\nCorporates paying more Another concern is that large companies will pay more to borrow money in the coming years as yields rise higher.
