Now we got two,” he said. \n“It’s definitely a challenge. It’s hard to prepare for that in some ways. But you know when you come down here that can happen. I‘m happy I played at nighttime. But I would back myself playing during the daytime also.” Slideshow (6 Images) \nFederer broke the Struff serve in the fifth game when he ripped a forehand past the advancing German. \nThat proved enough to take the first set and he needed just one break, this time achieved with a rasping backhand pass, to claim the decisive break at 3-3 in the second. \nFederer could never truly relax though and Struff broke for a 3-1 lead in the third set with some forceful tennis. \nHis advantage did not last long though as Federer replied in the next game and from then on Federer assumed control.
