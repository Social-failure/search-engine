Most fracking takes place on private lands. \nHowever, the rules for federal and tribal lands were never implemented because oil and gas industry groups sued to block them, arguing that they were unnecessary and would slow the country’s path to energy independence. That litigation ended when the Trump administration repealed the regulations last year. \nOn a conference call with reporters, California’s Becerra said the new litigation “is going to stand on its own.” \n“They did nothing at BLM to undo the rule with any justification or factual basis. There is plenty of reason to doubt that the fracking repeal engaged in by the Trump administration would withstand scrutiny in a court,” he added. \nSeveral of the environmental groups involved in that earlier litigation, including the Sierra Club, Earthjustice and the Center for Biological Diversity, also planned to file a lawsuit on Wednesday. \nA BLM spokeswoman declined to comment on the threat of litigation.
