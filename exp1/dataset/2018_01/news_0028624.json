We welcome the commitment yesterday by Angola’s National Bank to work with IATA to find a practical solution to release blocked funds,” said Alexandre de Juniac.\nHe said in nine African countries, international carriers were unable to repatriate their foreign currency earnings, while locally-based airlines had difficulties making on-time foreign currency payments to suppliers and business partners.\n“Aviation is vitally important to Africa. It currently supports 6.8 million jobs and contributes $73 billion in GDP across the continent,” said De Juniac.\nIATA forecasts a trebling in the size of Angola’s air transport market to 7.1 million passengers a year by 2036 at an annual growth rate of 6.7 percent.
