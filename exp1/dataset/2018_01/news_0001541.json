I‘m going to fail and learn, I‘m going to succeed. But I‘m the one in the arena. \n”In general, there are going to be critics and people who disagree with the way you do things but I think I‘m in a great place and starting 2018. \n“I‘m ready for anything. I‘m ready for failure, success and everything in between.” \nWith three major victories and a couple of other close calls under his belt, Spieth knows he will face stiff competition in 2018 from fellow 20-somethings like compatriot Justin Thomas, the defending champion at Kapalua. \n“The unknowns are very exciting right now with the amount of depth and talent at a younger age, mixed with guys in their 30s, number one in the world DJ (Dustin Johnson),” Spieth said. \n“Obviously the major question, what’s it going to be like with Tiger coming back,” he added in reference to 14-times major champion Woods, who hopes to play a full schedule after a back fusion operation last April. \n“It’s a pretty special time to be a part of professional golf.” \nSpieth and Thomas are among a small 34-man field that includes the top five players in the world -- Johnson, Spieth, Thomas, Jon Rahm and Hideki Matsuyama.
