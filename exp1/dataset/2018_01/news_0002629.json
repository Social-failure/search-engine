Europe is seizing the moment, Economist Andrew Zimbalist, a Cuba expert at Smith College in the United States, said.\nCuba faces a host of challenges, including declining aid from socialist ally Venezuela. Last month it extended the term of its current leadership to April, signaling a two-month delay in the historic handover from Raul Castro to a new president, while announcing tighter regulations on the non-state sector.\nThe official Juventud Rebelde newspaper reported on Wednesday that the EU is the most important exporter and second trading partner of Cuba, and also the most important donor of cooperation and foreign investment.\n(Reporting by Marc Frank; Editing by Susan Thomas)", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-03T20:08:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-04T01:48:03.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
