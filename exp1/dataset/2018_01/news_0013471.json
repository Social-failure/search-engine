The [graphic] assumes that you took any dividend paid out in cash and did not reinvest into the company by buying more stock.\" \nKeep in mind, though, that while Google's stock has performed well, any individual stock can over- or under-perform and past returns do not predict future results. \nThese days, Google is coping with widespread frustration about its parent company Alphabet's inability to identify and remove offensive content from YouTube, as well as claims from the Department of Labor that a gender pay gap exists among Google employees. \nStill, investors are bullish on the company as it continues to expand its reach beyond Internet search and into phones, virtual assistants, and productivity and entertainment services. \nAs Rob Sanderson, an analyst at research firm MKM Partners recently wrote , Alphabet \"should provide investors with reliable gains into 2018 and beyond. … The company continues to deliver exceptional growth for a company its size.\" \nIf you're interested in investing in Google, or just considering getting into the stock market, experts advise beginning carefully. Buffett and other experienced investors such as Mark Cuban and Tony Robbins suggest you start with index funds . \nIndex funds hold every stock in an index such as the S&P 500 and offer low turnover rates, attendant fees and tax bills. They also fluctuate with the market and eliminate the risk of picking individual stocks.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-11T16:54:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-11T16:54:29.017+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
