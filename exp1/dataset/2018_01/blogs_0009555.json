He has charged that conditions exist that still could cause another crisis despite the myriad additional regulatory burdens put on banks in the past seven years.\nFor instance, he has taken on Jamie Dimon after the J.P. Morgan Chase CEO said the problem of too big to fail had been solved.\nKashkari said banks should have to follow capital rules similar to those imposed on ordinary borrowers who have to pay a 20 percent deposit when buying homes.\n\"If we made banks put 20 percent down in terms of equity on their own portfolio, we would basically protect taxpayers against future bailouts. Right now they have about half the equity they need,\" he said. \"We can't control everything, but if we can identify the risks, do the analysis, put forward sensible solutions, then other legislators and policymakers can take it forward.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-09T17:50:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-09T17:58:42.007+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
