His only blemish a dropped shot on the par-five 13th when he found water off the tee. \nBoth Saddier and Paisley are seeking their first wins on the European Tour and hold a four-shot lead over South African Jacques Kruyswijk (67), who is alone in third on nine under-par. \nHome favourite Branden Grace and American Chase Koepka, the overnight joint leaders, both shot 71s to slip to five shots off the pace, along with two-time US Open champion Retief Goosen (67).
