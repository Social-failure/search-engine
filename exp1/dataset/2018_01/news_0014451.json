I think the end of April also still is not excluded, but then things have to move fast,” Finance Minister Johan Van Overtveldt told VRT television.\nBelgium business daily De Tijd reported on Wednesday that Citigroup, JP Morgan, Merrill Lynch and UBS had been tasked with leading the initial public offering (IPO) of a 25-35 percent stake in the bank.
