But human rights groups put the figure higher, accusing police of executing drug users and peddlers in cold blood. \nOn Wednesday, Duterte’s spokesman, Harry Roque, said there were no “extrajudicial killings” in the war on drugs. \nBut he welcomed the comments as a reflection of Washington’s growing appreciation of the campaign’s benefits. \n“These efforts are anchored on respect for human rights, cognizant of our obligation to protect our people’s right to life and to live in peace and security,” Roque said in a statement. \nPolice resumed their anti-drug campaign on Monday with visits to the homes of users and dealers to convince them to surrender, and police chief Ronald dela Rosa offered an assurance it would be free of violence. \nDela Rosa there were no deaths reported in the first 24 hours after operations resumed. \nWalsh also said Washington has been cooperating with Cambodia, China, Indonesia and the Philippines and has seen traffickers now use bitcoin to flood the U.S. market with synthetic drugs from China and Mexico. \nBut he gave no details of the use of virtual currencies in the narcotics trade.
