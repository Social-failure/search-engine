They benefit from guaranteed returns on investments set by regulators and needed no acquisitions or disposals to grow, Birnbaum said.\n“Our networks business is a fundamentally growing area, even without M&A ... We see this growth not only in Germany, but also in Sweden and eastern Europe. Those are booming markets.”\nBut networks must also shoulder the cost of integrating large amounts of intermittent renewable energy sources, mostly solar and wind, which will require billions of euros in investment over the next few years.\nLEGAL ACTION E.ON’s network business also faces a profit squeeze, as Germany’s network agency plans to cut investment returns, causing grid operators to take legal action to protect their earnings.\nIf implemented in their current form, these lower returns would cut profit by about 150 million euros a year from 2019, Birnbaum said, adding that the exact impact was still unclear given ongoing legal proceedings.\nBirnbaum said that a more efficient dismantling process of its nuclear plants could lead to lower costs, which would benefit the bottom line, adding E.ON hoped to ultimately spend less than the 9.6 billion euros set aside for the task.\nA planned February listing of Enerjisa could also help, with strong demand expected for the sale of up to a fifth of the its Turkish joint venture with Sabanci, which IFR reported could be valued at more than $2 billion.\n“There are no plans to exit Turkey,” Birnbaum said.\nEditing by Maria Sheahan and Alexander Smith\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-01-24T22:20:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-24T21:22:19.064+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
