In 2012, Pfizer and partner Johnson & Johnson called off additional work on the drug bapineuzumab after it failed to help patients with mild to moderate Alzheimer's in its second round of clinical trials.\nThe company said on Saturday that it will launch a new venture fund to invest in neuroscience research projects.\nPfizer is expected to make a presentation on Monday at the JP Morgan healthcare conference in San Francisco, a key annual event for healthcare investors.\n(Reporting By Elizabeth Dilts, Editing by Rosalba O'Brien)", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-07T21:49:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-08T00:24:26.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
