The requirement introduced last April had been 10,000 followers with no viewing time standard. \nBooting small channels from advertising eligibility will not fully address concerns raised by advertisers about videomakers going too far, YouTube acknowledged in the blog post. \nCelebrity video blogger Logan Paul has 15 million followers, but YouTube last week pared back its commercial relationship with him after he drew public outrage for showing a suicide victim in a clip. \nYouTube executives said they would “schedule conversations with our creators in the months ahead” to see “what more we can do to tackle that challenge.” SPONSORED FINANCIAL CONTENT ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-08T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-17T11:41:11.009+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
