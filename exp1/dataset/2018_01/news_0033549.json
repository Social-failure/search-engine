While this would represent a year-on year rise of 9 percent, it is below a previous Casino forecast for a 15 percent rise.\n“Casino seems to have missed its full year food retail guidance in France. Since forex has moved in the wrong direction in recent weeks, the consensus probably needs to adjust its 2018/19 earnings per share estimates,” analysts at brokerage Bryan Garnier said in a note.\nCasino shares were down 5.9 percent at 1057 GMT, sharply underperforming the European retail sector and dragging down shares in its domestic rival Carrefour. Casino shares rose around 10 percent in 2017.\nSIGNS OF WEAKNESS AT MONOPRIX Casino, which controls Brazil’s Grupo Pao de Acucar , posted fourth-quarter sales of 10.01 billion euros, broadly in-line with market expectations of 9.980 billion euros.\nStripping out acquisitions, disposals, currency effects and fuel, group sales rose 3.2 percent year-on-year, a slight deceleration from 3.4 percent growth in the third quarter.\nIn France, mild weather in October hurt clothing sales at Monoprix, where sales fell 0.5 percent on a same-store basis in the quarter after rising 3.1 percent in the third quarter.\nThe weather also hurt non-food sales at its Geant hypermarket, which fell 9.6 percent in the quarter.\nThe decline at Geant, however, also stems from the fact that Casino has reduced retail space for non-food items in response to competition from online and smaller convenience stores to focus on fresh and organic products. Geant food sales rose 2.8 percent in the quarter.\nIn Brazil food retail sales were driven by its Assai cash-and-carry stores despite continuing food price deflation.\nCasino, however, expects the macro-economic situation in Brazil to improve in 2018, and for deflation to ease off.
