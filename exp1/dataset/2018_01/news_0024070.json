There wouldn’t be any imminent devaluation pressures, so the time is right to do it,” he said.\nUnlike some other countries in the region, Morocco has managed to avoid a big drop in foreign investments since the global financial crisis and the Arab Spring uprisings of 2011, partly by marketing itself as an export base for Europe, the Middle East and Africa.\nExports have been growing since attracting heavyweights in the automotive and aeronautic industries and a weaker currency would also help the tourism sector and remittances from the 4.5 million Moroccans living abroad.\nHowever, rising commodity prices could push up in inflation in a country that is one of the region’s biggest energy importers. That would put the government in a delicate position as it is already faces strong protests over hardship in remote areas.\nElsewhere, Russia’s rouble climbed to a more than 7-month high of 56.42 to the dollar as oil prices consolidate recent sharp gains.\nSouth Africa’s rand also saw its biggest rise in over a week though Turkey’s lira nudged lower again as traders readied for a central bank meeting there later in week against the backdrop of double-digit inflation.\nFor GRAPHIC on emerging market FX performance 2017, see tmsnrt.rs/2e7eoml For GRAPHIC on MSCI emerging index performance 2017, see tmsnrt.rs/2dZbdP5\nFor CENTRAL EUROPE market report, see\nFor TURKISH market report, see\nFor RUSSIAN market report, see) (Additional reporting by Claire Milhench; Editing by Toby Chopra)\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-15T12:22:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-15T12:38:54.002+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
