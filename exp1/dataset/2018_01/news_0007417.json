Price increases of no more than 10 percent would be allowed for each travel season.\n“Every one percent rise in the domestic ticket price system-wide boosts the Chinese airline sector’s earnings by 7 percent based on our estimates,” said Corrine Png, Singapore-based chief executive of transport research firm Crucial Perspective.\nChina Southern Airlines ( 1055.HK ) likely would be the biggest beneficiary as it had the largest domestic market share, she added.\nChina Southern shares leapt more than six percent to an over two-year high, while Air China ( 0753.HK ) rose more than 8 percent to its highest level since Nov 2010 and China Eastern Airlines ( 0670.HK ) climbed more than 5 percent.\nBeijing has pledged to allow market forces to play a more decisive role in its aviation industry to improve service quality and efficiency.\nIt relaxed airfare restrictions for the first time in nearly a decade in 2013, and two years later allowed airlines to set ticket prices on 101 routes.\nThe new ruling applies to at least another 306 routes, including the profitable Beijing to Shanghai route, according to the document that was dated Dec. 17 and published by the regulator on its website.\nReporting by Brenda Goh; Editing by Stephen Coates\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-01-08T15:02:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-08T14:05:48.001+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
