Overall, he netted 46 goals in 229 appearances for the French club. \nAt Spurs he will join up with former PSG team mate Serge Aurier, who made the same switch in August. \n“Serge said a lot of good things about the club, about the coach, about the fans. He’s crazy! He’s a very nice guy and an amazing player. I’m so happy to play with him again,” Moura said. \nMoura will also be eligible to play for Spurs in the Champions League.
