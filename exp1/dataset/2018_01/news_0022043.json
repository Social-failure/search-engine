We do however favour yen outperformance as assume that investors have become overly complacent as regards BoJ policy.\"\nThe dollar was flat against the euro, holding below the key level of $1.20 before the publication of the minutes of the last European Central Bank meeting in December, when policymakers held monetary policy unchanged.\nMarket sentiment seems tilted toward the dollar's downside, said Masashi Murata, currency strategist for Brown Brothers Harriman in Tokyo.\n\"Market reaction to dollar-buying factors has been subdued, while market reactions to dollar-selling, and yen-buying factors, have been more vivid,\" Murata said.\nThe Canadian dollar weakened to its lowest level this year, before recovering, as worries of a U.S. withdrawal from the North American Free Trade Agreement moderated bets that the Bank of Canada will raise interest rates next week.\nThe Australian dollar touched its highest levels in nearly three months at $0.7887 after data showed that Australian retail sales recorded the biggest monthly rise in four years in November.\nBitcoin tumbled another 10 percent after South Korea said it would move to ban cryptocurrency trading.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-11T04:22:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-11T04:53:20.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
