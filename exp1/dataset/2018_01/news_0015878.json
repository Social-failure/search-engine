We will not borrow for Halkbank,” Simsek, who is responsible for the Turkish Treasury, told the Hurriyet newspaper. \nHe said the Treasury’s strong cash position was not related to Halkbank, comments likely aimed at easing investor concern about the impact of the case on state finances. \nTurkey has said it will take any “necessary measures” to protect banks from any impact of the case. \nThe case has strained already fragile ties between the NATO allies. Ankara has said the U.S. judiciary relied on fabricated evidence and cast the case as a plot to undermine Turkey. \nSimsek said the government’s “necessary measures” referred to liquidity support for elements of the financial system against the possible outcomes of the case, Hurriyet reported.
