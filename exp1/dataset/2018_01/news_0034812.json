REUTERS/Jose Luis Gonzalez/File Photo The U.S. government shutdown took effect at midnight on Friday after Democrats and Republicans failed to agree on a last-minute deal to fund government operations.\nThe Senate scheduled a vote on a stopgap spending measure for noon on Monday.\n“The markets are taking all of this in relative stride, for now,” said Greg Peters, senior portfolio manager at PGIM Fixed Income.\nFILE PHOTO: U.S. dollar and Euro notes are seen in this November 7, 2016 picture illustration.

I think the move is looking increasingly overdone.” said Esiner.\nReporting by Saqib Iqbal Ahmed; Additional reporting by Jennifer Ablan; Editing by Meredith Mazzilli\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "http://reut.rs/2DRQfO1"], "published": "2018-01-22T08:31:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-22T19:09:22.002+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
