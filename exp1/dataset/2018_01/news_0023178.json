Organizers did not seek approval from local authorities for the gathering, he said. \n“The police used rubber bullets initially but the crowd didn’t leave. Finally the security members had to shoot. The conflict happened when some people tried to seize guns from the police,” he said. \nTun Ther Sein, regional MP from Mrauk U, said some of the critically injured protesters were taken to the state capital of Sittwe, a three-hour drive south of the ancient town studded with Buddhist temples. \nThe Rakhine, also known as Arakanese, are one of the 135 officially recognised ethnic groups in Myanmar. Their identity is closely connected to the once powerful Arakanese kingdom along the Bay of Bengal, which was conquered by the Burmese kingdom in 1784. The kingdom was once an important stop on the old silk trade route. \nTensions in Rakhine have risen since a sweeping Myanmar army operation in August inflamed communal tension and triggered an exodus of over 650,000 Rohingya Muslims to Bangladesh. \n(This story has been corrected to say Bay of Bengal, not Andaman Sea, in seventh paragraph) Reporting By Yimou Lee, Shoon Naing and Thu Thu Aung; Editing by Bill Tarrant", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-17T07:54:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-17T08:11:13.006+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
