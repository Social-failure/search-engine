The index had gained 0.53 percent earlier in the session to hit a record high of 35,700.72.\nEnergy companies were among the top gainers, with the Nifty energy index climbing as much as 1.9 percent, its second straight session of gains.\nHowever, investors booked profits in recent outperformers such as ICICI Bank Ltd which lost as much as 2.5 percent after gaining in the last six sessions. ITC Ltd snapped a three-day gaining streak to trade 0.9 percent lower.\nWipro Ltd slid as much as 3.6 percent after the software services exporter on Friday posted an 8.5 percent drop in third-quarter profit on one-off provisions.
