The chicken was produced on January 15, and the department did not disclose when the sample was taken.\n\"Investigations showed that only chilled poultry was sold by the premises concerned and no sale of live poultry was found,\" the spokesman said. \"The affected batch of chilled chickens was sold out.\"\nOfficials have asked the shop to carry out thorough cleaning and disinfection.\nIn addition, vendors have been asked to suspend the procurement or sale of chilled chickens from the involved processing plant from the mainland, which is named Huidong County Baishisheng Agriculture Co Ltd, located in neighbouring Guangdong province.\nRelevant mainland authorities have been invited to help in the investigation.\nPoultry surveillance would also be stepped up in light of the incident, the spokesman added.\nThe city's Centre for Health Protection urged the public to stay alert against avian influenza. People who have recently handled chilled chickens from the concerned batch and developed fever or respiratory symptoms within seven days are advised to immediately seek medical advice and tell their doctor about their exposure.\nThe latest case surfaced after the department revealed on January 12 that traces of H5N6, a subtype of bird flu virus, were detected at a fresh provision shop in Wan Chai. The virus was found in a swab of a chopping board and in skin swabs of a chilled duck sample.\nThe public has been asked not to touch their mouth, nose or eyes when handling poultry products or eggs. As high temperatures can kill the avian flu virus, poultry meat should be thoroughly cooked before consumption.\nThis article appeared in the South China Morning Post print edition as: Chicken with bird flu sold in Mong Kok shop", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-24T04:56:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-24T05:23:47.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
