The Democratic candidate in the March 13 election is Conor Lamb, a Marine veteran and former U.S. attorney.\nThe race is being watched nationally as an indicator of whether Democrats can be competitive in Republican-leaning congressional districts ahead of November’s midterm elections, when control of both houses of Congress will be at stake.\nTrump won the district by nearly 20 points in the November 2016 presidential election and surprised political observers by winning Pennsylvania, traditionally a Democratic-leaning state, by less than 1 percent.\nIn an interview with Reuters on Wednesday, Trump pledged to be heavily involved in the year’s congressional races, including the one to replace Murphy.\nFILE PHOTO: Conor Lamb delivers a speech at his campaign rally in Houston, Pennsylvania, U.S. January 13, 2018.

REUTERS/Aaron P. Bernstein In a special U.S. Senate election in Alabama late last year, the president first backed the incumbent candidate in the Republican primary, Luther Strange, who had been named temporarily to fill the seat vacated by Jeff Sessions when Trump named him U.S. attorney general.\nAfter Strange lost to Roy Moore, Trump switched his support to Moore. The president stood by him even after Moore was accused of sexual misconduct - allegations that the Republican candidate denied.\nMoore lost to Democrat Doug Jones in the general election, a shocking result in deeply conservative Alabama and shaving Republicans’ majority in the Senate to 51-49. Exit polls showed that many voters turned out to register their disapproval of Trump.\nOn Tuesday, Democrats scored an upset in a Wisconsin state Senate special election in a district Trump won by about 17 points.\nRepublican Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker on Twitter called the result was “a wake up call” for the party there.\nReporting by James Oliphant; Editing by Caren Bohan and Leslie Adler\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-18T02:29:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-18T02:46:40.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
