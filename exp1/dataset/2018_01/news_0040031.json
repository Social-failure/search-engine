Cedar declined to comment on the matter.\nHong-Kong headquartered, Singapore-listed Noble was once Asia’s biggest commodity merchant, with ambitions to rival European industry leaders like Vitol or Glencore.\nBut it was plunged into crisis in 2015 over questions about its accounting, which resulted in sharp share price falls and credit downgrades. Noble has refuted such criticism.\nFinancial woes led to Noble’s retreat from most financial commodity markets, including oil and natural gas.\nIt has sold off some of its units to direct competitors, including Vitol and Mercuria.\nIts share price has collapsed almost totally from its peak of S$17.57 in 2011, resulting in a market capitalization of just S$272 million ($205.84 million) on Monday. Noble shares are currently trading at S$0.27.\nThe company’s $750 million 8.75 percent bonds, due March 2022, were Quote: d at a bid price of 44.25, up half a point.\nThis is equivalent to a yield of 35.4 percent, meaning the firm’s bonds remain distressed as bondholders expect to recover less than half their investments.\nReporting by Susan Mathew in Bengaluru, additional reporting by Muyu Xu in Beijing and Daniel Stanton in Singapore; Editing by Himani Sarkar\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-01-22T15:26:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-23T17:47:38.007+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
