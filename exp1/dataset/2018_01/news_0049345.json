Jay-Z, who had gone into the show with eight nominations, won nothing.\nAudiences for the Grammys had risen in 2016 and 2017.\nFinal, official audience data for the show will be released later on Monday.\nReporting by Jill Serjeant; Editing by Andrew Hay\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-29T18:58:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-29T19:24:17.024+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
