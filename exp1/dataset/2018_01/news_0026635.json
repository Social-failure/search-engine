They have extended the pact until the end of 2018.\nThe OPEC forecast of higher rival supply could add to a debate about the effectiveness of keeping the curbs in place. A ministerial monitoring panel meets this weekend in Oman and is expected to discuss the eventual exit strategy from the deal.\nBut the forecast was balanced by figures in the report showing OPEC's compliance with the supply cuts remained high in December and a further sharp slide in Venezuelan oil output.\nOil prices edged higher after the report was released to trade above $69 a barrel and later steadied. Prices are close to the highest since December 2014.\nIn a further sign excess supply is easing, OPEC said inventories in developed economies declined by 16.6 million barrels in November to 2.933 billion barrels, 133 million above the five-year average.\nOPEC's stated goal is to reduce stocks to the five-year average.\nVENEZUELA, UAE\nOPEC's production in December based on figures it collects from secondary sources showed overall production rising.\nTotal output rose by 42,000 bpd to 32.42 million bpd, led by a gain in Nigeria which along with Libya was exempted from the supply cut because unrest had curbed their production.\nBut adherence by the 11 OPEC members with output targets rose to 129 percent, according to a Reuters calculation based on the OPEC figures, higher than 121 percent in November based on last month's report.\nThe figures that OPEC members reported themselves showed deeper declines in production.\nVenezuela, whose output is dropping amid an economic crisis, told OPEC its production sank by about 216,000 bpd to 1.621 million bpd in December, believed to be the lowest in decades.\nThe UAE, which lagged many of its peers on compliance last year, said it cut output by 38,000 bpd to below its OPEC target for the first time. The compliance improvement comes as the country prepared to assume the rotating OPEC presidency in 2018.\nWith outside producers expected to pump more, OPEC in the report cut its estimate of global demand for its crude in 2018 by 60,000 bpd to 33.09 million bpd.\nShould OPEC keep pumping at December's level and other things remain equal, the market could move into a deficit of about 670,000 bpd next year, suggesting inventories will be drawn down further.\nLast month's report pointed to a similar deficit of about 700,000 bpd.
