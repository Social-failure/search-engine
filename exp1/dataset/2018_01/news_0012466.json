Some PPP projects, however, are used by local governments to borrow money.\nThe CIRC said on Friday the new rules are aimed at preventing insurers from turning private equity investment into lending, which raises financing costs in the real economy.\nThe regulator also said schemes should not be used to increase local governments’ liabilities.\nReporting by Beijing Newsroom, Samuel Shen and John Ruwitch; Editing by Sam Holmes\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-01-05T12:22:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-05T09:42:37.029+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
