Lehtikuva/Heikki Saukkomaa/via REUTERS/File photo \nShe credits the mentality of the region as being a key component in her skiing success. \n“When I have decided to do something, I always do my best. I’ve always been like that, I’ve had it with me throughout my upbringing, the mentality that exists there,” Kalla said in a recent interview with Elle magazine. \n“It takes time to be successful, you have to be prepared to work hard and have patience. I was prepared to give that time.” \nKalla celebrated Christmas atop the 2017/18 FIS overall World Cup rankings ahead of four Norwegians - Ingvild Oestberg, Heidi Weng, Marit Bjoergen and Ragnhild Haga - and they will provide tough opposition for her in Pyeongchang at the Feb. 9-25 Winter Games. \nWith her technical skills improving year after year, Kalla comes into the 2018 Games at the peak of her powers, but more than anything else, it is her never-say-die attitude that is likely to put her on the podium in Pyeongchang.
