Full-year 2017 net income was $95.7 million, or $0.69 per diluted share.\nAs was previously disclosed in a Current Report on Form 8-K filed by Old National with the Securities and Exchange Commission on December 22, 2017, the 4 th quarter results included an estimated revaluation of the Company’s deferred tax asset due to the new “H.R.1” tax reform law. Old National recorded $39.3 million of additional tax expense to estimate the impact of a reduction to its deferred tax asset. Also included in the 4 th quarter were the following pre-tax charges: $11.9 million for merger and integration, $3.0 million for branch consolidations, $1.6 million in severance, $1.3 million for Foundation funding and $0.7 million for a client experience improvement initiative. Excluding these items from the current quarter and netting out securities gains, Old National would have reported net income of $32.7 million, or $0.22 per share. Refer to Table 5 for Non-GAAP net income reconciliation.\n“Old National capped off a very successful 2017 with another strong quarter,” said Old National Chairman and CEO Bob Jones. “Our 4th quarter saw a continuation of strong operating results highlighted by double digit commercial loan growth coupled with strong credit quality, controlled deposit costs and steady core expenses. We accomplished all of this while expanding into Minnesota with the successful closing of our Anchor-Minnesota partnership. We are optimistic as we look ahead to 2018 given the strength of our franchise and the foundation we have built for sustained, positive operating leverage.\n“While the immediate impact of the Tax Cut and Jobs Act is the necessary writedown of a portion of our deferred taxes, the positive impact that reduced taxes will have on Old National and our clients will be significant in 2018 and beyond,” continued Jones. “We are already hearing from our clients about increased investments in technology and other capital expenditures. This is a similar story for us, as we expect to use some of the benefit to enhance our client experience through increased investments in technology. We continue to be a leader in investments in our communities, underscoring our commitment by making a contribution to our Foundation.”\nCommitted to our Strategic Imperatives\nOld National’s continued steady performance and strong credit and capital positions can be attributed to the Company’s unwavering commitment to the three strategic imperatives that have guided Old National for 13 years:\n1. Strengthen the risk profile; 2. Enhance management discipline; and 3. Achieve consistent quality earnings.\nBalance Sheet and Net Interest Margin\nAt December 31, 2017, total period-end loans, including loans held for sale, increased $1.708 billion to $11.136 billion from $9.428 billion at September 30, 2017.
