Over 12 percent of buyers were based in Portugal.\nThe bond was priced with a coupon of 2.125 percent and a re-offer yield of 2.137 percent. A year ago, a smaller syndicated issue yielded over 4.2 percent.\nPortuguese yields fell sharply during 2017 following an extension of the European Central Bank’s asset purchase scheme and helped by the once bailed-out country’s improving economy and finances, which allowed it to return back to investment grade ratings after a nearly 6-year hiatus.
