Jackson contributed all 11 of his points in the first half.\nMinnesota (14-8, 3-6), which lost for the fifth time in the last six games, got 13 points and just five rebounds from junior power forward Jordan Murphy -- the nation’s No. 2 rebounder. Senior point guard Nate Mason added 11 points and nine rebounds.\nWhile the Gophers played without suspended senior center Reggie Lynch for the sixth straight game, sophomore guard Amir Coffey (11 points) returned from the shoulder injury that cost him the last five games.\nMinnesota blitzed out to a 10-point lead in the opening nine minutes. Coffey hit his first shot to get the Gophers started, then Murphy scored eight points in less than three minutes to stake Minnesota to a 20-10 lead with 11:01 left in the first half.\nOhio State needed just four minutes to regain the lead as Jackson flushed three 3-pointers and Wesson added nine points as the Buckeyes went on a 24-2 spree to seize a 34-22 lead with 4:14 to go before halftime.\nOhio State’s defense became even tougher to solve in the second half as the Gophers went 6 of 21 from the field (29 percent) with nine turnovers.\nMason’s layup with 11:34 to go pulled Minnesota within 51-40. By the time the Gophers made their next shot from the field -- Coffey’s layup with 2:06 to play -- Ohio State owned a 62-44 lead.\n--Field Level Media\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-01-21T03:18:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-21T13:24:20.008+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
