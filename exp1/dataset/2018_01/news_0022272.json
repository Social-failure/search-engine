Chesnot—Getty Images By Chris Morris 11:56 AM EST \nDespite warnings of a bubble and massively fluctuating values, bitcoin continues to fascinate investors and new industries. And now the housing industry is starting to dip its toes into the water. \nOne Miami condo seller is only accepting Bitcoin offers, while online real estate brokers say several other listings are willing to accept bitcoin as a payment option. (A residential/commercial property in the Isle of Man is also accepting the digital currency.) \nBut how many bitcoin does it take to actually buy a house? The national median home price in November 2017 was $248,000. Using the midday price of bitcoin (as reflected on CoinDesk) on Jan. 15, that works out to 17.65 bitcoin. \nNational averages aren’t a lot of good in some areas, though. We gathered median prices for November 2017 in a number of states and cities to find out how much home your Bitcoin would buy. Home bitcoin values by city \nSan Francisco – $1.588 million (per Paragon Real Estate Group) / 113 bitcoin \nSeattle – $ 725,000 / 51.6 bitcoin \nLos Angeles – $ 583,000 / 41.5 bitcoin \nWashington, D.C. – $550,000 / 39 bitcoin \nPhoenix, AZ – $243,000 / 17.3 bitcoin Home bitcoin values by state \nConnecticut – $247,500 / 17.6 bitcoin ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-15T13:56:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-15T19:03:04.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
