REUTERS/Kim Hong-Ji In the 2016-2017 season around 4.8 million South Koreans took to the slopes.\nWhether local or national government will bear the cost of maintaining the 14 venues for the Pyeongchang Olympics after the games finish, is a matter of some debate.\nSlideshow (18 Images) “We are making our point that (these facilities) should be managed by the state,” Choi Moon-soon, the governor of Gangwon Province, which will host the 2018 Winter Olympics, told Reuters this week.\n“(The) ski jump slope, for instance: this won’t be used only by Gangwon and this will be barely used by anyone else except national athletes ... So we’re asking those who will use to pay for it.”\nWhether South Korea’s new and revamped Olympic venues will thrive, or face the same struggles that led to the Alps Ski Resort’s closure remains to be seen.\nBut the tattered buildings and piles of rubbish, including dozens of discarded toilet bowls, that litter the resort’s landscape are a reminder of the challenges the sport continues to face in South Korea.\nWriting by Mark Hanrahan in London; Editing by Robin Pomeroy\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-19T19:46:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-19T20:13:17.016+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
