He could face life imprisonment if convicted. \nAlfons Becker, the lawyer for BVB said attending the trial was difficult for Bartra who confronted the suspect for the first time on Monday.

That shook him,” Becker said. \nIn a summary of Bartra’s testimony released by the court, he was quoted as saying he feared for his life and that he would never see his family again.
