That was lower than previously indicated, reflecting currency changes.\nIn 2018 it said it expected profit of between 520 million pounds and 560 million pounds, which it said represented underlying growth when it had stripped out assets it sold this year.\nThe group said pressures in North America had continued, with sales in U.S. higher education courseware down 3 percent on an underlying basis, in line with the lower end of its revised guidance range.\n​ (Reporting by Kate Holton, Editing by Paul Sandle)\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-01-17T15:26:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-18T15:58:34.007+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
