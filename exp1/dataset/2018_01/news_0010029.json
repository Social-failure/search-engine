That compared with 58 percent of Scots, polled separately, unchanged from February.\nAs for Scotland, which voted to stay in the EU, Brexit is not a catalyst for Scottish independence from the UK but it has not dampened separatist fervor either, the poll found. Support for secession is at about 44 percent versus 45 percent in a 2014 independence referendum.\nThe poll also showed 52 percent of Britons now expect a “bad deal” versus 55 percent of Scots. That compares with 37 percent of Britons last February.\nNatCen also found that support for a different Scottish immigration policy from the rest of the UK after Brexit, as favored by the Scottish government, does not have majority support either and most Scots want the same immigration policy nationwide.\nIn Britain as a whole, 61 percent of those polled thought Brexit had been badly handled by the UK government, up from 41 percent in February and versus 69 percent in Scotland.\nScotCen polled 859 people, all of whom had been interviewed as part of the 2015 or 2016 Scottish Social Attitudes survey, which is carried out face to face.\nReporting by Elisabeth O'Leary; Editing by Leslie Adler\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-10T00:58:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-10T01:13:42.043+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
