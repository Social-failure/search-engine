He was one of the most prominent supporters of leaving the European Union during a divisive referendum campaign.\n“I’d rather us stay in than leave like that,” the newspaper Quote: d Johnson as telling friends in an unsourced report.\nA spokesman for Johnson declined to comment on the report.\nMay, who voted ‘Remain’ in 2016 but has committed to guiding Britain out of the bloc, is seeking a two year transition period after a March 2019 exit, during which Brussels rules would still apply. She wants a long term divorce deal that would allow “frictionless” trade with the bloc.\nThat plan has led to criticism from some Brexit advocates that Britain could end up leaving in name only, and would remain subject to rules set by the EU.\nLast week another senior Brexit campaigner, Nigel Farage, said he was warming to the idea of a second referendum as a way to end attempts by some senior politicians, including former Prime Minister Tony Blair, to stop Britain from leaving.\nReporting by William James; Editing by Richard Balmforth\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-01-15T22:43:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-15T22:16:38.002+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
