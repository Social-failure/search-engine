We have the tools we can use along with our allies ... that’s the discussion we’re having about tightening up sanctions and trying to get Europe involved in that,” he added. \nTrump has warned that the U.S. will not continue to abide by the nuclear accord, which he has called “the worst deal ever negotiated”, and Britain, France and Germany have begun talks on a plan to satisfy him by addressing Iran’s missile tests and its regional actions. \nIran has one of the Middle East’s largest missile programmes and some of its precision-guided missiles have the range to strike Israel. Tehran has repeatedly said its missile programme is defensive and not negotiable. \nSunni Muslim Saudi Arabia, the UAE and other Arab countries accuse Iran of stoking wars and political crises around the region by supporting its Shi‘ite co-religionists. \nTehran denies the charges and accuses Gulf Arab states of being pawns of Western powers seeking to dominate the region and advance the interests of its foe Israel.
