REUTERS/Vincent Kessler/File Photo Farage, who as UKIP leader convinced Prime Minister Theresa May’s predecessor, David Cameron, to call the Brexit referendum and then helped lead the campaign for Brexit, has repeatedly scolded May for being too weak in the EU divorce talks.\nHe said in a video clip posted on Twitter that he would meet the EU’s chief Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier on Monday and appealed for people to send him their questions to put to Barnier.\n“I thought who is in there representing the views of the 17.4 million people? Nobody,” Farage said. “Well I’ve finally got my meeting with Mr Barnier. Its going to happen.”\nFILE PHOTO: Nigel Farage, ex-leader of Britain's anti-EU UK Independence Party (UKIP), speaks at a press conference of the Germany's far-right Alternative for Deutschland (AfD) party in Berlin, Germany, September 8, 2017.

The EU and Britain are discussing the terms of the divorce.\nFarage, 53, casts the EU as a doomed experiment in German-dominated unity and excessive debt-funded welfare spending.\nHe has dismissed speculation from opponents of Brexit such as former British Prime Minister Tony Blair that voters might change their mind about leaving the EU.\n“The revolution of 2016 is still rolling,” he told Reuters in November. “The European Union project is in deep trouble and it’s only a matter of time until it ends.”\nReporting by Guy Faulconbridge; editing by Costas Pitas\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-05T10:39:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-05T10:53:24.008+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
