Guo was jailed for life last year. Xu died of cancer in 2015 before he could face trial.\nZhang Yang, who served on the commission alongside Fang, committed suicide in November while being investigated for corruption and over his links to Guo and Xu.\nReporting by Philip Wen; Editing by Clarence Fernandez\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-09T13:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-09T13:08:44.006+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
