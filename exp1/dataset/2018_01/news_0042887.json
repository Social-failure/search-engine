Since then it has missed three $290 million repayments on the loan, and negotiations around a potential sale and restructuring began over a year ago.\nAmong its creditor banks, Akbank extended $1.5 billion, Garanti lent it some $1 billion and Isbank some $500 million, according to the banks’ third-quarter financial statements.\nThe company’s largest creditor banks declined to comment on the report.\nGaranti Bank, Isbank and Akbank reclassified Oger Telecom’s debt as “closely watched” at the end of 2017.
