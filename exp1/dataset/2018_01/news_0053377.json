Shareholders of Dr Pepper Snapple DPS, +24.45% will own about a 13% stake in the merged company, which will be listed on the New York Stock Exchange. \nThe deal is estimated to be worth $18.9 billion, excluding debt, according to Dealogic, which said it would top the previous record for a soft-drink acquisition -- JAB’s 2015 takeover of Keurig Green Mountain for $13.9 billion. \nThe combination gives Keurig, best known for its K-Cup coffee systems, an express lane to get its bottled coffee drinks into coolers at convenience stores, drugstores and other retailers at a time when ready-to-drink coffee sales are growing rapidly.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-29T22:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-29T22:10:12.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
