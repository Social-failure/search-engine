Vu's lawyers said on Tuesday they had applied for his passage to Germany to avoid being sent to Vietnam, where serious security offences such as revealing state secrets, can carry the death penalty.\nSingapore has no extradition treaty with Vietnam but its immigration authority has the power to repatriate people under certain circumstances, according to the city-state's Immigration Act.\nA representative of Singapore's Immigration and Checkpoints Authority said on Tuesday Vu was arrested on Dec. 28 \"for committing offences under the Immigration Act\".\nVu's case adds a new international dimension to a Vietnamese corruption crackdown that has brought the arrest of dozens of officials and business figures and is entangled with political intrigues in the single-party communist state.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-03T07:53:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-03T08:03:41.003+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
