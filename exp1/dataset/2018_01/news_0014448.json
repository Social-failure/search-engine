REUTERS/Toby Melville \nThe meeting came after London Mayor Sadiq Khan warned that Britain would be shunted into a “lost decade” of low investment and shed almost 500,000 jobs if it fails to agree a trade deal with the EU. \nKhan cited research from the Cambridge Econometrics consultancy which showed that in a no-deal scenario, the industry that fares the worst will be financial and professional services, with as many as 119,000 fewer jobs nationwide. \nHours earlier recruitment firm Morgan McKinley said Brexit was the main reason for a 37 percent drop in new jobs available in London’s financial sector last month. \nLondon vies with New York as the world’s financial capital. By far the biggest EU financial centre, London dominates the $5.1-trillion-a-day global foreign exchange market and hosts more banks than any other centre. \nBut other EU capitals see Brexit as an opportunity to grab business from London. The EU has already proposed that clearing of euro-denominated derivatives, done mainly in London, could move to the euro zone without a comprehensive Brexit deal. \nA stand-off between Britain and the EU over future access to the single market for London’s financial services industry is shaping up to be one of the key Brexit battlegrounds before Britain is due to leave the bloc in March 2019. A FAREWELL TO LONDON? \nMany banks, insurers and other financial firms are enacting contingency plans to shift parts of their European operations to the continent because they are likely to lose the right to sell their products freely within the bloc from London. \nBloomberg reported that Germany would demand Britain pay for financial firms to have access to the EU market after Brexit, though EU officials said Britain would not be able to cherry pick its post-Brexit relationship. \nA spokesman for May on Thursday said Britain will not pay for market access.
