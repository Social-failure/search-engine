Let us go ahead and convene already,” Mercado told a hearing on Tuesday. \nThe alternative, of creating a special constitutional convention, would cost 11 billion pesos ($218 million), he added. \nSenators are opposed to combining the two chambers to draft the amendments, which would make the normally powerful 24-seat upper house less relevant in the process. On Monday, Senator Panfilo Lacson launched a resolution urging the senate to convene a constituent assembly of its own. \nThe push to change the constitution has been a divisive issue, with critics accusing lawmakers of trying to prolong their stay in office, or of creating a way for Duterte to stay in power beyond the end of his term in 2022. \nOpponents warn the process could bring a repeat of the 1970s-era of late dictator Ferdinand Marcos and say they are troubled by Duterte’s stated admiration for him, and the president’s similar authoritarian traits. \nThe opposition says the 1987 constitution was drafted to stop that from happening. \nDuterte has made clear he has no desire to stay longer than his term and, if anything, would prefer to retire earlier. \nLawmakers have yet to decide on what federal model to adopt, Mercado said. Duterte’s preference is for one similar to that of France.
