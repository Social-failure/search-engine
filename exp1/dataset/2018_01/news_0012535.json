It was marked by scathing jokes about sexual misconduct scandals in the entertainment industry and beyond, and by passionate speeches about female empowerment. \nOprah Winfrey’s powerful speech about female and black activism won the most attention, sparking calls by fans on social media for her to run for U.S. President in 2020. Winfrey was accepting a lifetime achievement award. \nEvery major female celebrity wore black on the normally colorful red carpet to show support for the Time’s Up $15 million campaign launched last week to support victims of sexual harassment in the workplace. \nThe biggest winners at the Golden Globes were indie movies “Lady Bird” and “Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri.” Reporting by Jill Serjeant, editing by Rosalba O'Brien", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-08T20:03:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-08T20:18:06.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
