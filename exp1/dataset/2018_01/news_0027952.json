My ankle is -- I don’t know how it is because I don’t feel it any more.” Tennis - Australian Open - Rod Laver Arena, Melbourne, Australia, January 20, 2018. Simona Halep of Romania reacts during her match against Lauren Davis of the U.S. REUTERS/Thomas Peter \nDavis, a baby-faced 24-year-old with a monster forehand, was majestic in defeat, breaking Halep three times when the Romanian served for the match and battling on after losing a toenail late in the game. \nShe came within an inch of the biggest win of her career when she swooped forward to pounce on a speculative drop-shot and whipped a passing shot to earn three match points at 11-10. Slideshow (2 Images) \nHalep nervelessly saved them all, winning five points in a row for a galvanising hold before Davis removed her sneaker and walked gingerly to her chair. \nShe took a medical timeout to stall Halep’s momentum and the Romanian fumed on the baseline as a trainer worked on Davis’s toe. \nWith Davis hobbled slightly, Halep moved in for the kill but the American saved five break points to frustrate her opponent, and later thanked the net cord for helping her hold again at 12-12. \nHalep finally breached Davis’s serve at 14-13, and edged a 17-shot rally to come within two points of victory. \nApparently spent, Davis swung hard in a desperate late flurry but missed twice, a forehand sailing just wide to allow Halep to continue her bid for a long-awaited maiden grand slam title.
