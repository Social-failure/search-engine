It evolved into an alert box company and more recently has added on automation features that allow home video surveillance and remote locking and unlocking of doors.\nThe company had said it would sell 111.11 million shares to pay down debt, with the underwriting banks also having the option to buy an extra 16.67 million shares.\nIt ended up selling an initial 105 million shares, with the underwriting banks having the chance to buy 15.75 million shares.\nADT is expected to start trading as a public company on Friday on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol ADT.\nMorgan Stanley, Goldman Sachs, Barclays, Deutsche Bank Securities and RBC Capital Markets were joint book-running managers for the IPO.\nReporting by Joshua Franklin in New York; Editing by Carmel Crimmins and Cynthia Osterman\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-19T03:16:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-19T03:37:18.020+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
