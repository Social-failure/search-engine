It’s very stable.”\n“Now we need to wait and study the results of the first phase,” he added when asked whether there were any immediate plans for further reforms.\nThe new system has widened the band in which the dirham can trade against hard currencies to 2.5 percent either side of a reference price, from the previous 0.3 percent.\nThe central bank manages the dirham against a currency basket in which the euro has a weight of 60 percent and the dollar 40 percent.\nGROWTH The more flexible currency system will boost GDP growth this year by 0.2 percent on top of the previous forecast of 3.2 percent, Boussaid said.\nInflation will accelerate to 1.5 percent this year and the dirham move could add as much as 0.4 percent to it, he added.\nLast year inflation was 0.2 percent, according to the High Planning Commission which collects economic data. GDP growth was 4 percent last year but officials have said a lower agricultural output due to less rain would weigh this year.\nThe budget deficit will be 3 percent in 2018, the minister said, down from 4 percent last year.\nThe more flexible exchange system will also have positive impact on Morocco’s current balance as it would attract investment and guard the economy against shocks while facilitating exports, he said.\nThe kingdom, which has enjoyed stronger growth than other Arab counties as it escaped the turmoil and militant attacks seen in Egypt and Tunisia, could go to the international debt market but was in no hurry as it had plenty of financial options, he said.\n“Possible. It’s always possible,” he said when asked whether a Eurobond issue was possible this year.\nThe government said two weeks ago it was seeking a new form of IMF precautionary line of credit.\nIn 2016, the IMF granted Morocco a two-year, $3.5-billion credit line to reassure its foreign lenders, investors and rating agencies, allowing it to tap international capital markets at more favorable borrowing terms.\nReporting by Ulf Laessing; Editing by Andrew Heavens\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-01-30T22:19:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-30T16:29:15.015+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
