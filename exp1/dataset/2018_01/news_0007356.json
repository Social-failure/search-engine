Morgan Healthcare Conference.\n“We are pleased with our execution in 2017 and are excited about the adoption that we are seeing of the Inovalon ONE™ Platform,” said Keith Dunleavy, M.D., Inovalon’s chief executive officer and chairman of the board. “Our differentiated cloud-native capabilities, ecosystem connectivity, and expanding datasets are enabling new opportunities, driving market demand, and are resulting in positive financial performance. Reflecting this, we experienced double-digit organic revenue growth and strong year-over-year margin expansion in the fourth quarter, within our previously-conveyed guidance.”\n“Our expected fourth quarter results continue to demonstrate the increased operating leverage we are seeing in our business,” said Chris Greiner, chief financial officer and chief operating officer of Inovalon. “Favorable offering mix and pricing, as well as technology-enabled efficiencies, have led to expanded gross margin, allowing us to continue to invest in innovation and sales, while still delivering year-over-year Adjusted EBITDA margin expansion, in line with our prior guidance.”\nIn addition, as a result of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 enacted on December 22, 2017, the Company will remeasure its deferred tax assets and liabilities. While the Company is still evaluating the impact of the changes to the tax code, the Company expects the changes to result in a significant decrease in provision for income taxes and corresponding material increase in net income and Non-GAAP net income for the fourth quarter and full year 2017. The Company will provide a further update on the impact of this adjustment in its fourth quarter and full year 2017 earnings release on February 20, 2018.\nAll full-year and fourth quarter 2017 estimated financial information contained herein, including performance and results, are preliminary estimates determined in good faith based on Inovalon’s internal reporting for the fourth quarter and fiscal year 2017 and remain subject to the completion of the Company's customary quarterly close and review procedures related to its year-end financial statement closing process and review and audit by the Company’s independent public accounting firm. Where a range of potential results has been provided herein, a midpoint of such range is assumed for illustrative purposes only, and such midpoint should not be viewed as an indication of management’s expectations or actual results. Material adjustments may arise between the date of this press release and the dates on which the Company announces its full fourth quarter and fiscal year 2017 results and files its Form 10-K for the fiscal year 2017 with the SEC.\nAdjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin are Non-GAAP measures. Explanations of why the Company finds Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin useful and a reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to GAAP are included later in this press release.\nJ.P. Morgan Healthcare Conference\nThe Company is scheduled to present at the J.P. Morgan Healthcare Conference at 3:00 p.m. (PT) on Wednesday, January 10, 2018. Investors may access a live audio webcast of the presentation on the Investor Relations section of Inovalon’s website at http://investors.inovalon.com .
