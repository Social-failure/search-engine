But he has to be 100 percent ready emotionally, not just physically, to have a chance to win the title.” \nSwiss Wawrinka admitted he was not yet free of pain from the knee injury which has also kept him out of action since Wimbledon ahead of his match against unseeded Lithuanian Ricardas Berankis. \nWhile Halep’s match against local wildcard Destanee Aiava is also on the main showcourt, it is fair to say that Sharapova’s clash with Germany’s Tatjana Maria is probably the more intriguing match up, if only for how the crowd receives her. \nSharapova failed the dope test after her quarter-final loss to Serena Williams here two years ago and although her 15-month ban has done little to dim her appeal to tournament organisers, Melbourne fans might not be so forgiving.
