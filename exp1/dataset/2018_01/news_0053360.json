Police investigators look for evidence at the scene of a bomb explosion at a police station in San Lorenzo, Ecuador January 27, 2018. Picture taken January 27, 2018. REUTERS/Daniel Tapia \nThe Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) fought the Colombian government for more than 52 years, but demobilized after a 2016 peace deal. \nThough thousands of members handed over their arms, more than 1,000 are estimated to have refused, choosing to continue lucrative drug trafficking and illegal mining. \nPolice seized more than seven tons of chemicals and another ton of drugs in recent days and arrested seven people linked to dissident FARC operating on the border, according to official data. \nZambrano said the groups are seeking to “frighten the population” as the government combats drug trafficking.
