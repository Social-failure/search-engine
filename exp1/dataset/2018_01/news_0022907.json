REUTERS/James Oatway \nTheir slender hopes were dealt a further set-back when Cheteshwar Pujara (19) became the first Indian player ever to be run out twice in a test. \nNgidi had a hand in that too as he chased the ball down to the boundary and stopped a four, with his cut-back to AB de Villiers allowing for a bullet throw to wicketkeeper Quinton de Kock that saw Pujara short. \nPujara had also been run out first ball in the first innings and has now been involved in six of India’s last eight run-outs in tests.
