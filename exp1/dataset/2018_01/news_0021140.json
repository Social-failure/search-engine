He said Chile especially lost ground after the index added a gender component, since its legislation has “various restrictions against women.”\nOn Saturday, Bachelet called on the World Bank to investigate, while her economy minister called its actions “immoral.”\nThe World Bank said its methodology was not designed with any single country in mind but that it would conduct an external review of Chile’s indicators in light of Romer’s comments.\nReporting by Antonio de la Jara; Writing by Luc Cohen; Editing by Nick Zieminski\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-01-15T02:07:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-14T20:22:38.005+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
