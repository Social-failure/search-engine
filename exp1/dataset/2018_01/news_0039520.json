I am the happiest human in all the land,” the 23-year-old said.\nBrita Sigourney also qualified for the U.S. Freeski team after defeating compatriot Devin Logan and Sochi gold medalist Maddie Bowman.\nEditing by Greg Stutchbury\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-01-21T10:48:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-21T06:07:07.001+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
