It’s slightly unfortunate it’s been demonstrated in this way but it reinforces what a big fanbase we are. \n“Transparency has been at the heart of everything we do. We’re not going to hide. We’re big enough to take the feedback and engage with supporters and they should trust us to do the right thing.” \nLeeds, who are 10th in the Championship, are fallen giants of the English game, having won the top-flight title three times as well as the FA Cup and League Cup.
