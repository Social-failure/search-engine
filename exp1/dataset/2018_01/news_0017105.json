KFC Canada presents The #Bitcoin Bucket. Sure, we don’t know exactly what Bitcoins are, or how they work, but that shouldn’t come between you and some finger lickin’ good chicken. https://t.co/2OKuCHk5Hb pic.twitter.com/UwaduB8toi \n— KFC Canada (@kfc_canada) January 11, 2018 \nThe offer, only available in Canada (“apologies, rest of the world,” the company says on its website), is a limited time offer—and the first wave has already sold out. For $20 worth of your digital currency, you’ll get 10 original recipe tenders, waffle fries, a medium side, gravy, and 2 dipping sauces. The company will even deliver it to buyers. \nKFC Canada is having a good time with the promotion, even promising a free bucket to Bitcoin founder Satoshi—on one condition: If Satoshi reveals his true identity, his bucket is on us. #BitcoinBucket \n— KFC Canada (@kfc_canada) January 11, 2018 \nThe move is a first in the restaurant world. While select franchise locations of other restaurant chains accept Bitcoin as payment, this appears to be the first time a parent company has embraced the digital currency. \nWhile Bitcoin is the only cyrptocurrency KFC is accepting right now, the company did hint in a separate tweet that it’s considering expanding that for future promotions.
