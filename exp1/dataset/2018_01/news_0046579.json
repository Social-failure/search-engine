A complete ban on abortion was only lifted in 2013 to allow terminations in cases where the motherâ€™s life was in danger. \nThe Irish Times/MRBI poll found that 56 percent of voters would support a change in the constitution so the government can legislate for abortion on request up to 12 weeks, with 29 percent opposed and 15 percent undecided. \nBut it showed sharp divisions remain on the issue. While 74 percent of voters under the age of 25 were in favor of the change, only 36 percent of voters over 65 supported it. \nThe Irish Times in an editorial about the poll said that while there had been a striking move towards liberalization of abortion in the past year, the referendum result was far from a foregone conclusion.
