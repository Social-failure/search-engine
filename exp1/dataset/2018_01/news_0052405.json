Azcarraga remained chairman of the board.\nThe head of their cable division was shot dead in November after a group of men tried to steal his bike on a highway outside Mexico City. The company has since appointed a temporary head of the unit.\nThe new leadership team, coupled with Televisa’s efforts to shore up its advertising business, will likely mean volatility in the company’s stock, Intercam analyst Alik Garcia said.\n“There are several issues accumulating,” he said.\nReporting by Mexico City Newsroom; Editing by Frank Jack Daniel and Lisa Shumaker\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-01-26T22:52:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-27T00:24:32.006+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
