Denis played better than me in the Montreal match, but today I broke him three times to love and that was the key.” \nDefending champion Sock lost 6-3 6-3 in only 61 minutes to his German opponent, who is ranked 65th in the world. \nThe Australian Open, the first grand slam of the year, runs from Jan. 15-28.
