Analysts had expected debt of around 2.54 billion, according to a Thomson Reuters poll.\n\"The results are not bad: the debt, even though only slightly better than expected, surprised to the positive,\" a Milan-based analyst said.\nFCA trimmed its expectations for 2018 revenues and forecast adjusted operating profit and its cash position at the lower end of previous guidance.\nThe world's seventh-largest carmaker said it expected full-year revenues of around 125 billion euros, down from a previous forecast of around 136 billion.\nIt sees adjusted earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) of at least 8.7 billion euros compared with a range of between 8.7-9.8 billion euros before.\nFCA expects to cancel all debt during 2018 and generate around 4 billion euros in net cash this year. It previously guided for net cash of 4 billion to 5 billion euros.\nFor the fourth quarter, FCA reported a 22 percent rise in adjusted EBIT, in line with a Thomson Reuters poll of analysts, while revenues fell 3 percent.\nThe automaker also said that a special $2,000 bonus for U.S. employees, announced on January 11, will be paid to approximately 60,000 hourly and salaried employees, excluding senior leadership, in the second quarter.\nâ€” CNBC contributed to this report .", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-25T14:29:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-25T16:46:23.027+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
