It might prompt more sellers to come out,” a trader said.\nBids were also due in an auction process by 5pm on January 24 on a €25m block of Steinhoff’s revolving credit facility (RCF), sources said.\nThe seller was a bank selling its entire RCF exposure, one of the sources added.\nCreditor groups of Steinhoff are joining forces to position themselves for a potential debt restructuring before the company meets creditors on Friday.\nRoughly €2bn of Steinhoff’s €10.7bn in debts mature this year.\nSteinhoff, owner of more than 40 retail brands including Poundland in Britain, is trying to plug a liquidity gap after admitting “accounting irregularities” last month, which triggered an 85% share price slide for the group.\nEditing by Alasdair Reilly\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-01-25T01:49:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-25T13:27:31.004+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
