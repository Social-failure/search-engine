(NYSE AMER:NSPR), a leader in embolic prevention systems (EPS) / thrombus management technologies and neurovascular devices, today announced preliminary unaudited sales results for the fourth quarter of 2017. The Company anticipates sales of approximately $833,000 for the fourth quarter of 2017, compared to $322,000 for the same period last year. This represents an approximately 159% increase, which is primarily due to increased sales of CGuard™ EPS. The Company anticipates a 211% increase in sales of CGuard™ EPS to approximately $606,000, compared to $195,000 for the same period last year.\nJames Barry, PhD, Chief Executive Officer of InspireMD, commented, “CGuard™ EPS is not only gaining acceptance among key opinion leaders (KOLs) that treat carotid artery disease, but these physicians are now asking us, unsolicited, to be more involved with our program. We believe this growing interest, combined with our specialized distribution network, positions us for even stronger sales growth as these KOLs support our expansion into the mainstream group of users that include vascular surgeons, interventional cardiologists, interventional radiologists and interventional neuroradiologists. In addition to Europe, we are now establishing a foothold in Asia, evidenced by recent distribution agreements in India, Hong Kong, Taiwan, Australia, New Zealand and Vietnam. For these and other reasons, we are extremely encouraged heading into 2018.”\nConference Call\nThe Company plans to host a conference call today, Wednesday, January 10th, at 10:00 a.m. Eastern Time to discuss recent developments, preliminary unaudited fourth quarter 2017 sales results, and proposals under consideration for the upcoming shareholder meeting.
