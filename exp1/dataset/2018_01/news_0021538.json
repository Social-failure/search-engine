The sin is to allow these fears to determine our responses, to limit our choices, to compromise respect and generosity, to feed hostility and rejection.” Migrants wait for Pope Francis to lead a special mass to mark International Migrants Day in Saint Peter's Basilica at the Vatican January 14, 2018. REUTERS/Max Rossi \nAs politicians and civil society grapple with the mass movement of people around the world, with flashpoints including in the Mediterranean, and between Myanmar and Bangladesh, the pope has repeatedly urged support for those who migrate. \nArgentina-born Francis, who was the first non-European elected to the post in nearly 1,300 years, has criticized President Donald Trump’s stated intention to build a wall to stop illegal migrants crossing the U.S. border with Mexico.
