Morgan Chase and Wells Fargo beat expectations last week. S&P 500 earnings are expected to increase by 11.8 percent for the fourth quarter, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.\nThe broader move higher in U.S. index futures also came on the back of dollar weakness in the past week, with the greenback falling to a three-year low against the euro in the last session.\nStill, the softer dollar was supportive of U.S. manufacturing and exports, explained Frank Troise, managing partner at SoHo Capital.\nHe added that t he move higher in U.S. stocks more generally was the result of markets \"starting to price in expectations of inflation.\"\nThe only significant data point Tuesday is the latest Empire State Manufacturing survey, set to be reported at 8:30 a.m. ET.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-16T06:35:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-16T06:47:29.007+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
