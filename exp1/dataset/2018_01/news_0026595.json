Existing investors also contributed extra funding, it said.\nRoofstock said it had surpassed more than $1 billion in property transactions on its platform since its inception.\nLaunched in early 2016, Roofstock runs an online marketplace where retail and institutional investors can buy and sell homes in the United States occupied by renters. It also identifies local property managers to help new owners manage the homes.\nIt is among the cohort of startups that are using technology to simplify and expand access to real estate investing. Its investors include venture capital firms Canvas Ventures, Bain Capital Ventures and Khosla Ventures.\nRoofstock says it offers a user-friendly way for investors to buy properties in cities where they do not reside without having to travel to the location and find local brokers.\n“A lot of buyers are first-time real estate buyers,” said Gary Beasley, co-founder and chief executive officer of Roofstock.\nMany of these customers are individuals who want to get on the property ladder but cannot afford to buy homes in costly cities where they live such as San Francisco and New York, Beasley said.\n“We are making it really accessible,” he added.\nThe company plans to use the funding to grow its team and expand into new markets in the United States, Beasley said.\nReporting by Anna Irrera; Editing by Cynthia Osterman\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-18T13:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-18T13:13:59.069+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
