He declined to specify what would constitute a reasonable price.\n“The company is on the brink of being a commercial-stage biotech company. There are not a lot of these companies in Europe, so it is a very big achievement,” he said.\nNovo Nordisk had been very open about its interest in Ablynx’s lead product, he said, but it was important that other programmes continued. The Danish bidder has said it would maintain Ablynx’s strong research and development base in the Belgian city of Ghent.\nNovo Nordisk is offering up to 30.50 euros per Ablynx share.\nThe shares were trading at 34.66 euros on Thursday, giving it a market capitalisation of 2.95 billion euros.
