The Netherlands has to stop using natural gas.” \nAmid an ongoing legal battle, the government had proposed last year capping production at the Groningen gas field at 21.6 bcm per year for five years, after a 2015 report found production was risking lives. \nThat reduction, the justification for which is currently under a legal review, would be down from 24 bcm in the production year just ended and 39.4 bcm in 2015-16. \nThe NAM joint venture between Royal Dutch Shell and ExxonMobil operates the Groningen field.
