I would be very happy also for him to do that,” Mourinho was quoted as saying by British media. “I expect him to join.” \nCarrick played in four pre-season games for United but his sole competitive appearance this season was in their League Cup win over Burton Albion when he began “feeling strange”. \nHe had treatment called a cardiac ablation, which aims to control or correct certain types of abnormal heart rhythms. \nMourinho said he expected Carrick to return to action this season for United before taking up a coaching role. \n“(He had) a few months without even training so now he is in his second week of training with the team. He is a very important player for us,” said the Portuguese. \n“I think the decision - to be at the end of the season - is a good decision for the team and a good decision for him to finish playing football and not injured or with some problem.” \nCarrick made his debut for West Ham United in 1999 before joining Tottenham Hotspur in 2004 and then moving to United in 2006. He has played more than 300 games for the club and was named captain before the start of the current campaign. \nHe has won five Premier League titles, the Champions League, Europa League, FA Cup, three League Cups and the Club World Cup.
