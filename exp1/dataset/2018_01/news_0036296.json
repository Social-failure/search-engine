The Longhorns owned a 16-5 advantage in second-chance points, a 17-9 edge in bench scoring and a 30-20 bulge in points in the paint.\nNick Weiler-Babb and Lindell Wigginton scored 15 points each to lead Iowa State (11-8, 2-6). Cameron Lard added 12 for the Cyclones while Donovan Jackson scored just six points, 10 under his scoring average for the season.\nTexas ruled the first half, roaring out of the gate and building as much as a 15-point lead before settling for a 38-29 advantage at halftime.\nBamba and Roach II paced the Longhorns in the half, scoring 13 and 12 points, respectively.\nLard led the Cyclones with 10 points while Jackson and Wigginton, both who average more than 16 points per game for Iowa State, only scored three points each.\nThe Cyclones cut the lead to 49-43 on a 3-pointer by Weiler-Babb with 12:56 to play but Texas answered emphatically by scoring the next seven points on a dunk by Roach II, a 3-pointer by Bamba and a bucket by Davis Jr.\nNext up for Texas is Saturday home game vs. Mississippi. Iowa State hosts Tennessee, also on Saturday. Both games are part of the Big 12-SEC Challenge.\n--Field Level Media\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-01-23T10:33:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-23T18:17:46.011+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
