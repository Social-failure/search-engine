That move that would symbolically cut Britain off from the continent just as it is implementing Brexit. \nA French official said issues of unaccompanied children, asylum requests, border police cooperation and possible British support to the economic development of the Calais region will be part of the new agreement, which is still being discussed. \n“We’ll boost British financial support to the securitization of transport infrastructure, border police and security and we’ll raise this question of economic development,” the presidential adviser said. \nPro-Brexit lawmakers from Britain’s governing Conservative Party have dismissed as “absurd” suggestions that London should pay more, saying Britain already provides extra security to France, including border infrastructure.
