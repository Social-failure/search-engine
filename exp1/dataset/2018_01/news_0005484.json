When he won a novice national title in 2010, he said on the broadcast that he would be a factor in the 2018 Olympics. \nU.S. Figure Skating earlier selected national champion Bradie Tennell, 2010 Olympian Mirai Nagasu and teenager Karen Chen for the 2018 Games. \nThe remainder of the U.S. team will be named later on Sunday.
