These measures are not measurements recognized under GAAP.\nAdjusted operating income (loss) is defined as income (loss) from operations as adjusted for stock-based compensation. Adjusted EBITDA is defined as net income (loss) attributable to common stockholders as adjusted for interest income (expense), net; impairment of investment in Web International Education Group, Ltd.; income tax benefit (expense); noncontrolling interest; stock-based compensation; and depreciation and amortization. Interest income (expense) primarily consists primarily of interest expense for capital leases and interest income on customer receivables. Adjusted EBITDA and adjusted operating income (loss) exclude stock-based compensation, which consists of expenses for stock options, restricted stock, restricted stock units, and performance stock units.\nThis information should be considered as supplemental in nature and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the related financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. Management believes that the presentation of these non-GAAP measures provides useful information to investors regarding our results of operations because it is an indicator of performance with the removal of stock-based compensation which assists both investors and management in analyzing and benchmarking the performance and value of our business.\nWe believe adjusted EBITDA is useful to an investor in evaluating our operating performance because it is both widely used to measure a company's operating performance without regard to items such as depreciation and amortization, which can vary depending upon accounting methods and the book value of assets, and to present a meaningful measure of corporate performance exclusive of our capital structure and the method by which assets were acquired.\nOur management uses adjusted EBITDA and adjusted operating income (loss):\nas an additional measurement of operating performance because it assists us in comparing our performance on a consistent basis; in presentations to the members of our Board of Directors to enable our Board to have the same measurement basis of operating performance as is used by management to compare our current operating results with corresponding prior periods and with the results of other companies in our industry; and as consistent with lending covenants on our line of credit.\nOther companies may define these non-GAAP measures differently and, as a result, our use of these non-GAAP measures may not be directly comparable to adjusted EBITDA, and adjusted operating income (loss) used by other companies. Although we use these non-GAAP measures as financial measures to assess the performance of our business, the use of non-GAAP measures is limited as they include and/or do not include certain items not included and/or included in the most directly comparable GAAP measure.\nAdjusted EBITDA and adjusted operating income (loss) should be considered in addition to, and not as a substitute for, income or loss from operations, net income or loss, and earnings or loss per share prepared in accordance with GAAP as a measure of performance. Adjusted EBITDA is not intended to be a measure of liquidity. You are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these non-GAAP measures.\nA reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures is provided below.\nThree Months Ended December 31, Six Months Ended December 31, 2017 2016 2017 2016 (In thousands) Net income (loss) attributable to common stockholders $ 13,259 $ 11,652 $ 5,203 $ (2,181 ) Interest income, net (39 ) (264 ) (274 ) (606 ) Income tax (benefit) expense 564 7,688 (8,804 ) (1,002 ) Noncontrolling interest (70 ) (753 ) (173 ) (557 ) Stock-based compensation expense 7,217 4,598 10,296 9,292 Adjusted operating income 20,931 22,921 6,248 4,946 Depreciation and amortization 18,550 18,695 39,186 36,375 Adjusted EBITDA $ 39,481 $ 41,616 $ 45,434 $ 41,321\nAbout K12 Inc.\nK12 Inc.
