Indeed he said he is sticking with his current view that rates should be held steady until it is clear the economy has shifted to a faster underlying pace of growth, productivity has increased, or inflation and global interest rates move higher.\nThe bigger concern, he said, is if the Fed continues raising its short-term target interest rate and long-term yields remain low, raising the possibility that the overall yield curve becomes downward sloping with short-term rates higher than long-term ones. That sort of \"inversion,\" a sign that investors do not trust the long-term outlook and will not place long-term bets, has been a harbinger of a recession that the Fed should not risk.\n\"The time to have that debate is now, in the first part of 2018,\" Bullard said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-05T14:35:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-05T14:17:49.006+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
