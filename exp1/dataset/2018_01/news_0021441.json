Seven of its 10 main sectors were higher, while consumer staples and discretionary groups weighed. \n* The materials group, which includes precious and base metals miners and fertilizer companies, added 1.6 percent as a weaker U.S. currency boosted the price of gold to its highest since September. \n* Some of the world’s biggest gold miners were among the index’s most influential gainers, with Goldcorp Inc jumping 6.8 percent to C$19.10 and Barrick Gold Corp up 3.2 percent at C$19.49. \n* Cannabis companies bounced back after heavy losses late last week, with Canopy Growth Corp jumping 12.8 percent to C$36.50 and Aphria Inc surging 20.4 percent to C$21.70. \n* Cannabis companies have broadly jumped in recent months as Canada moves towards legalizing recreational use, but investors booked some profits last week after the U.S. federal government rescinded an order that had eased enforcement of federal law in states where the drug has been made legal. \n* BlackBerry Ltd, which launched new cybersecurity software which identifies vulnerabilities in programs used in self-driving cars, ended 2.8 percent higher at C$17.48. \n* The energy group climbed 0.4 percent as oil prices hovered near a three-year high, while financials gained 0.2 percent, with Sun Life Financial Inc up 2.8 percent at C$53.78 after two brokerages raised their price targets on the stock.
