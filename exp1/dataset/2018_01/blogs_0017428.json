Morgan especially will talk about how it's going to improve their ability to return capital and dividends and buybacks next year, as the other banks,\" Leon said.\nAnd it's not only the \"tax effect,\" he said. \"We're going to have terrific earnings in 2018. That's going to flow down to capital.\"\nHe advises investors to stay focused on the core business and the banks' ability to grow.\nFor one, loan growth has been modest and he expects the yield spread to widen through 2018 as the Federal Reserve increases interest rates.\n\"That creates more opportunities for higher earnings for these banks,\" Leon said. \"Also, they're putting a lot of efforts on cost controls.\"\nJ.P. Morgan Chase, along with BlackRock and Wells Fargo , kick off the financial earnings season Friday morning.\nLeon has a buy rating on J.P. Morgan and a hold on Wells Fargo. His top pick is Bank of America , which he said is \"firing on all cylinders.\"\nFor his part, Goldberg expects JPM to have another good quarter. He has a $132 price target on the stock and an overweight rating.\n\"On a relative basis they continue to take market share across both their retail and wholesale businesses,\" he said. \"They're buying back a fair amount of stock. They seem to have a good line on the cost side,\" he said.\nGoldberg also has an overweight rating on Wells Fargo and a $75 price target.\n\"They are not fully out of the woods yet but they've made, I think, great strides in putting some of these legacy issues behind them in terms of the retail sales practices, kind of improving the culture, kind of weeding out and changing out some of the executive team,\" Goldberg noted.\nâ€” CNBC's Gino Siniscalchi contributed to this report \nDisclosures: JPM and WFC are investment banking clients of Barclays.
