REUTERS/Abhishek N. Chinnappa Its strategy in India has so far rested on flash sales on leading homegrown e-commerce player Flipkart and U.S. tech giant Amazon.com’s Indian sites, an approach that helped Xiaomi save on expensive marketing spends and grab market share.\nJain, who declined to provide financial metrics, said Xiaomi will launch six to eight new smartphones across key price ranges in 2018.\nManu Kumar Jain, Managing Director of Xiaomi India, gestures as he speaks during an interview with Reuters inside his office in Bengaluru, India, January 18, 2018. REUTERS/Abhishek N. Chinnappa “We want to improve on whatever we launched in 2017 and also launch and plug whatever we think are the big use cases where we are not present,” he said.\nLast year, Xiaomi launched eight smartphones priced from 4,999 Indian rupees ($78) to 32,999 rupees ($516). Samsung, by comparison, offers more than 40 smartphone models in India.\nXiaomi also plans to unveil at least one or two new smart products in 2018. It already sells airpurifiers and fitness bands in India and will likely venture into TVs, water purifiers, scooters and rice cookers in the future, Jain said.\n($1 = 63.8600 Indian rupees)\nReporting by Sankalp Phartiyal; Editing by Euan Rocha and Alexander Smith\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-19T20:35:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-19T20:49:11.009+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
