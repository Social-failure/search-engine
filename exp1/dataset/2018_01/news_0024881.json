A source familiar with the matter said on Monday this was largely due to problems at Carillion.\nThese were also the main driver for a jump in provisions at Santander UK’s global corporate bank, another source said. They rose to 47 million pounds in the nine months to September 2017, up from 21 million pounds a year earlier.\nThe bank is likely to take a further hit at its annual results in February, the source said. At RBS’s commercial bank, provisions in the third quarter also spiked, growing from 20 million pounds in 2016 to 151 million pounds. At the time, Chief Executive Ross McEwan said this was down to a “single name”.\nThe banks declined to comment on their exposure to Carillion.\n“I suspect that Lloyds and RBS could take a further writedown in Q4, and in addition to that the other lenders to Carillion are likely to take a writedown as well,” said John Cronin, head of UK banks research at analyst firm Goodbody said.\n“The question is how material that is.”\nSHAREHOLDERS SUFFER Asset managers with stakes in the company have also been among the casualties since Carillion’s crisis first became apparent last year.\nScotland’s Kiltearn Partners, Canada’s Letko Brosseau and Associates and BlackRock - the world’s biggest asset manager - held large stakes in Carillion before a July 10 profit warning, which triggered a 39 percent plunge in its shares on the day.\nThe Carillion logo is seen at a building site in London, Britain January 15, 2018. REUTERS/Peter Nicholls Back then Kiltearn was Carillion’s top investor with a 10 percent stake, according disclosures made to the stock market. BlackRock had a 7.6 percent shareholding and Letko owned 6.1 percent. All three have since cut down on their holdings.\nA spokesman for Kiltearn said the investment firm did not hold any shares by the time Carillion was placed in liquidation, having already reduced it stake to 4.9 percent by December.\nBlackRock’s holding went below 5 percent - meaning it no longer had to disclose its stake - just days after the July warning, while Letko’s stake had been cut to 2.8 percent by November.\nSHORT POSITIONS PAY OFF Among those who benefited from Carillion’s demise, hedge funds shorting its shares have however made paper profits of hundreds of millions of dollars over the last year.\nWith a quarter of Carillion’s shares shorted at the beginning of July 2107 – a total value of around $270 million – short-sellers made around $190 million when its share price fell 70 percent over the course of three trading days following the July profit warning, according to Reuters calculations.\nMany of the same funds made an additional $20 million when Carillion again warned on profits in November 2017, sending its shares down a further 48 percent in a single day.\nThe latest disclosures to Britain’s watchdog the Financial Conduct Authority show that BlackRock had a 1.95 percent short position on Carillion stock as of Jan. 11.\nA spokesman for BlackRock declined to comment on its overall exposure to Carillion. Letko did not respond to an emailed request for comment.\nHedge funds Bodenholm Capital and Coltrane Asset Management, which both also disclosed bets against Carillion shares to the FCA, made 4 million pounds each from shorting the stock since the July warning, Reuters calculations show.\nShort-sellers pay institutional shareholders a fee to borrow their shares, before selling these on into the market. In most cases the hedge fund hopes to buy these shares back at a lower price in the future, return them to the original shareholder and pocket the difference.\nBut if a company enters liquidation and its shares are eventually deemed worthless, the hedge fund does not have to return the stock.\n“They will sit on people’s books for a while, the short-sellers will continue to pay a rental fee for a period of time to the original holder, but eventually they will be written off by both sides,” said David Lewis, an analyst covering short-selling at data provider Astec Analytics.\n“The short-seller gets to keep the money they sold it for.”\n($1 = 0.7251 pounds)\nadditional reporting by Maiya Keidan; Editing by Keith Weir\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-15T18:11:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-15T18:29:03.002+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
