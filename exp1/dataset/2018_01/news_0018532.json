A spokeswoman confirmed that he was referring to an application in the first half of 2018. \n“In no way we can present any risk to the euro zone,” he said, describing Bulgaria’s two-decade linking of the lev currency to the euro and the country’s strong economic fundamentals, which are well within the criteria for euro zone membership. \nThe EU executive has said it supports the move but not all the 19 members of the single currency area are comfortable with Bulgaria joining.
