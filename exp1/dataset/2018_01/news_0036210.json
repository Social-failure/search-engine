Johnson & Johnson is uniquely positioned to lead during this dynamic era and deliver innovative solutions for patients and consumers that drive sustainable, long-term growth. We are pleased with the passage of recent legislation modernizing the U.S. tax system, which enables Johnson & Johnson to invest in innovation at higher levels to help address the most challenging unmet medical needs facing health care today.\"\nMr. Gorsky continued, \"I want to thank all of our talented colleagues for their commitment, passion and dedication to transforming the lives of patients and consumers worldwide.\"\nThe Company announced its 2018 full-year guidance for sales of $80.6 billion to $81.4 billion reflecting expected operational growth in the range of 3.5% to 4.5%. The Company also announced adjusted earnings guidance for full-year 2018 of $8.00 to $8.20 per share reflecting expected operational growth in the range of 6.8% to 9.6%. * Adjusted earnings guidance excludes the impact of after-tax intangible amortization expense and special items.\nSegment Sales Performance\nWorldwide Consumer sales of $13.6 billion for the full-year 2017 represented an increase of 2.2% versus the prior year, consisting of an operational increase of 1.3% and a positive impact from currency of 0.9%. Domestic sales increased 2.7%; international sales increased 1.9%, which reflected an operational increase of 0.4% and a positive currency impact of 1.5%. Excluding the net impact of acquisitions and divestitures, on an operational basis, worldwide sales decreased 0.5%, domestic sales decreased 0.7% and international sales decreased 0.3% * .\nWorldwide operational results, excluding the net impact of acquisitions and divestitures, were negatively impacted by declines in the Baby Care and Oral Care businesses, mostly offset by growth in over-the-counter products, including TYLENOL ® analgesics and upper respiratory products, and NEUTROGENA ® beauty products.\nWorldwide Pharmaceutical sales of $36.3 billion for the full-year 2017 represented an increase of 8.3% versus the prior year with an operational increase of 8.0% and a positive impact from currency of 0.3%. Domestic sales increased 6.7%; international sales increased 10.8%, which reflected an operational increase of 10.1% and a positive currency impact of 0.7%. Sales included the impact of the acquisition of Actelion Ltd. which was completed in June 2017 and contributed 4.2% to worldwide operational sales growth. Excluding the net impact of acquisitions and divestitures, on an operational basis, worldwide sales increased 4.2%, domestic sales increased 3.1% and international sales increased 5.8%. * Worldwide operational sales growth was negatively impacted by approximately 1.8 points due to a positive adjustment of U.S. rebate accruals in the first half of 2016, which did not repeat in the first half of 2017.\nWorldwide operational results, excluding the net impact of acquisitions and divestitures, were driven by new products and the strength of core products. Strong growth in new products include DARZALEX ® (daratumumab), for the treatment of patients with multiple myeloma, IMBRUVICA ® (ibrutinib), an oral, once-daily therapy approved for use in treating certain B-cell malignancies, a type of blood or lymph node cancer and TREMFYA ® (guselkumab), for the treatment of adults living with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis.\nAdditional contributors to operational sales growth included STELARA ® (ustekinumab), a biologic for the treatment of a number of immune-mediated inflammatory diseases, INVEGA ® SUSTENNA ® /XEPLION ® /TRINZA ® (paliperidone palmitate), long-acting, injectable atypical antipsychotics for the treatment of schizophrenia in adults, ZYTIGA ® (abiraterone acetate), an oral, once-daily medication for use in combination with prednisone for the treatment of metastatic, castration-resistant prostate cancer, and XARELTO ® (rivaroxaban), an oral anticoagulant, partially offset by declines in REMICADE ® (infliximab), a biologic approved for the treatment of a number of immune-mediated inflammatory diseases, due to biosimilar entrants.\nDuring the quarter, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved JULUCA ® (rilpivirine and dolutegravir), the first, complete, single-pill, two-drug regimen for the treatment of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection; a 10 mg once-daily dose of XARELTO ® (rivaroxaban) for reducing the continued risk for recurrent venous thromboembolism after completing at least six months of initial anticoagulation therapy; and SIMPONI ARIA ® (golimumab) for the treatment of adults with active psoriatic arthritis or active ankylosing spondylitis. The European Commission approved TREMFYA ® (guselkumab) for the treatment of adults with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis and granted approval to broaden the existing marketing authorization for ZYTIGA ® (abiraterone acetate) plus prednisone / prednisolone to include the treatment of newly-diagnosed high-risk metastatic hormone-sensitive prostate cancer.\nRegulatory applications for approval were submitted to the FDA and European Medicines Agency to expand the current indication of DARZALEX ® (daratumumab) for use in combination with bortezomib, melphalan and prednisone, as a treatment for newly diagnosed patients with multiple myeloma ineligible for autologous stem cell transplantation. In addition, a supplemental New Drug Application was submitted to the FDA for two new XARELTO ® (rivaroxaban) vascular indications: reducing the risk of major cardiovascular (CV) events such as CV death, heart attack or stroke in patients with chronic coronary and/or peripheral artery disease (CAD/PAD), and for reducing the risk of acute limb ischemia in patients with PAD.\nAlso in the quarter, a worldwide collaboration and license agreement was executed with Legend Biotech, a subsidiary of GenScript Biotech Corporation, to develop, manufacture and commercialize a chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell therapy, LCAR-B38M, targeting BCMA for the treatment of multiple myeloma.\nWorldwide Medical Devices sales of $26.6 billion for the full-year 2017 represented an increase of 5.9% versus the prior year consisting of an operational increase of 5.7% and a positive currency impact of 0.2%. Domestic sales increased 4.5%; international sales increased 7.1%, which reflected an operational increase of 6.7% and a positive currency impact of 0.4%. Sales included the impact of the acquisition of Abbott Medical Optics which contributed 4.5%, to worldwide operational sales growth. Excluding the net impact of acquisitions and divestitures, on an operational basis, worldwide sales increased 1.5%, domestic sales were flat and international sales increased 3.0%.*\nWorldwide operational results, excluding the net impact of acquisitions and divestitures, were driven by electrophysiology products in the Cardiovascular business; endocutters and biosurgicals in the Advanced Surgery business; ACUVUE ® contact lenses in the Vision Care business; and wound closure products in the General Surgery business, partially offset by declines in the Diabetes Care business and spine products in the Orthopaedics business.\nAbout Johnson & Johnson\nAt Johnson & Johnson, we believe good health is the foundation of vibrant lives, thriving communities and forward progress. That's why for more than 130 years, we have aimed to keep people well at every age and every stage of life. Today, as the world's largest and most broadly-based health care company, we are committed to using our reach and size for good. We strive to improve access and affordability, create healthier communities, and put a healthy mind, body and environment within reach of everyone, everywhere. We are blending our heart, science and ingenuity to profoundly change the trajectory of health for humanity.\n* Operational sales growth excluding the net impact of acquisitions and divestitures, as well as adjusted net earnings, adjusted diluted earnings per share and operational adjusted diluted earnings per share excluding after-tax intangible amortization expense and special items, are non-GAAP financial measures and should not be considered replacements for, and should be read together with, the most comparable GAAP financial measures. Except for guidance measures, reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures can be found in the accompanying financial schedules of the earnings release and the Investor Relations section of the company's website at www.investor.jnj.com . Johnson & Johnson does not provide GAAP financial measures on a forward-looking basis because the company is unable to predict with reasonable certainty the ultimate outcome of legal proceedings, unusual gains and losses, acquisition-related expenses and purchase accounting fair value adjustments without unreasonable effort. These items are uncertain, depend on various factors, and could be material to Johnson & Johnson's results computed in accordance with GAAP.\n** The provisional estimates are based on the Company's initial analysis of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the \"Act\") as of January 18, 2018. Given the significant complexity of the Act, anticipated guidance from the U. S. Treasury about implementing the Act, and the potential for additional guidance from the Securities and Exchange Commission or the Financial Accounting Standards Board related to the Act, these estimates may be adjusted during 2018.\nJohnson & Johnson will conduct a conference call with investors to discuss this news release today at 8:30 a.m., Eastern Time. A simultaneous webcast of the call for investors and other interested parties may be accessed by visiting the Johnson & Johnson website at www.investor.jnj.com . A replay and podcast will be available approximately two hours after the live webcast by visiting www.investor.jnj.com .\nCopies of the financial schedules accompanying this press release are available at www.investor.jnj.com/historical-sales.cfm .
