Soccer Football - Premier League - Brighton & Hove Albion vs Chelsea - The American Express Community Stadium, Brighton,   Chelsea manager Antonio Conte celebrates after the match REUTERS/Hannah Mckay \nBatshuayi, who has only scored two Premier League goals this season, offered a different dimension to target-man Morata against Brighton, and acted as the attacking pivot as Chelsea put in one of their best performances of the season. \n“The combination between Michy, Willian and me and the midfield was brilliant, we need more like this week after week,” two-goal Hazard said after the win at the Amex Stadium. \nChelsea’s second goal was especially pleasing on the eye. Batshuayi’s deft flick set Willian away for the strike, but the movement of the front three was just too much for Brighton to handle. \n“I am pleased for him (Batshuayi),“ Conte said. ”He is a young striker and it is normal for him to struggle a bit in this league, but at the same time I think he is progressing very well.” \nThe question is now whether Batshuayi has worked his way back into Conte’s plans. As Morata’s goals dried up, so did Chelsea‘s, and it was clear a change of approach was needed. \nBatshuayi provided that different option to the more direct approach Morata favours. \nWhile Conte may still sign a striker in this transfer window, bringing others into play and getting the best out of Hazard and Willian could have ensured Batshuayi’s Chelsea career is given a new lease of life.
