She wanted to be a movie star.\nPompeo grew up in Everett, Massachusetts, a suburb outside of Boston, where she lived with her father, grandfather and siblings. Her mother died unexpectedly when Pompeo was five, which fed her insecurities. \"I didn't have a mother to tell me how amazing I was,\" she told Good Housekeeping .\nHowever, he convinced her to audition anyway, if only to pay her rent. He predicted that the pilot wouldn't even air and Pompeo's fear of getting \"stuck\" on a medical drama would never come to fruition.\nBut not only did \"Grey's Anatomy\" air, it became an instant hit. \"I knew I was f ,\" Pompeo tells The Hollywood Reporter.\nshow chapters Suzy Welch: This is the biggest mistake people make when negotiating salary 8:56 AM ET Wed, 19 July 2017 | 01:44 After three seasons, Pompeo had the chance to leave the show or extend her contract. She knew she wasn't likely to find a better role anywhere else, so she stayed put. \"I was 36,\" she tells Good Housekeeping. \"I knew as a woman in the [movie] business that I wasn't going to be paid the same as men.\" (Indeed, Hollywood's male leads notoriously make millions more than its female stars .)\nWith \"Grey's\" now in its 14th season, Pompeo is one of the highest-paid actresses in Hollywood, earning more than $20 million a year, according to The Hollywood Reporter. She'll receive $575,000 per episode, a seven-figure signing bonus, producing fees and back-end equity in the deal, among other perks.\nTo get there, Pompeo had to learn it wasn't \"being greedy\" to ask for what she was worth.\n\"For me, Patrick [Dempsey] leaving the show [in 2015] was a defining moment, deal-wise. They could always use him as leverage against me — 'We don't need you; we have Patrick' — which they did for years,\" she says.\nPompeo recalls a time when she asked to be paid $5,000 more than Dempsey on principle, since she was the Grey in \"Grey's Anatomy,\" after all. The studio turned her down. But Pompeo didn't give up, either on her show or on her ambition.\nThese numbers show why you should negotiate your salary 2:09 PM ET Thu, 20 July 2017 | 01:03 In the end, Rhimes, who Pompeo describes as a mentor, delivered, signing off not only on Pompeo's increased paycheck but adding her as a producer on \"Grey's\" and as a co-executive producer on an upcoming spinoff.\nFourteen years in, the role Pompeo didn't want has turned into the one that defined her career and taught her to stand up and advocate for herself.\n\"You never think TV shows are going to go this long. Of course not, never, and especially me, I don't ever assume things like that,\" Pompeo tells Deadline . \"I just always try to stay present and humble and grateful and take each day as it comes.\"\nDon't miss:\nNFL star rookie Alvin Kamara took his bonus and bought chicken wings—here's why it was a smart move Suze Orman: Every millennial needs a wedding budget—even if you're not getting married Actress Teri Hatcher drives the same car for 100,000 miles—here's why it's such a smart choice Like this story?
