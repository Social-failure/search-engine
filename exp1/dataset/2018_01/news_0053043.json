Generally this falls back to those who concluded the settlement, and for sure there is no settlement unless there are violations and they are not concluded without the accused admitting it in writing and promising not to repeat it...” The official declined to give further details. \nAsked if Prince Alwaleed will retain his position as head of the Kingdom Holding Co, the official said: “Certainly”.
