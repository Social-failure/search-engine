It is targeting “at least” another 500 million pounds in savings over the three years starting in 2018-19. \nSainsbury‘s, which also owns the Argos chain, has a total workforce of 195,000 and is Britain’s second biggest private sector employer after Tesco. \nIt said in October it would cut up to 2,000 jobs mainly in its payroll and human resources departments, while about 400 jobs went in a store operations restructuring announced in March. \nShares in Sainsbury’s were up 0.4 percent at 258 pence at 1355 GMT.
