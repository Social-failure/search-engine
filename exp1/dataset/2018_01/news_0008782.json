Rosengren said it was possible the optimal rate of inflation could shift with time.\n“My own view is that we should be focused on an inflation range, with the potential to move within the range as the optimal inflation rate changes,” Rosengren said in prepared remarks at an event hosted by the Brookings Institution.\nHe said one possibility would be for the Fed to create a band that allowed U.S. inflation to range between 1.5 percent and 3 percent.\nRosengren said the optimal rate of inflation might not be 2 percent if achieving that requires interest rates close to zero. The Fed currently aims to keep overnight interbank lending rates between 1-1/4 percent and 1-1/2 percent.\nA number of Federal Reserve policymakers in recent weeks have called for changes or urged study of the Fed’s inflation framework.\nEarlier on Monday, San Francisco Fed President John Williams said the Fed could better fight a recession by committing to keep interest rates lower for longer to keep average inflation on a steady upward path over the years, a framework known as price level targeting.\nReporting by Jason Lange; Editing by Andrea Ricci and Diane Craft\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-01-09T05:58:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-09T09:40:34.838+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
