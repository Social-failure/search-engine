The assistant will be able to field broader requests about video, music and other tasks tied to entertainment.\nStill, that's a much narrower scope than the assistants already available from its bigger rivals in the battle to build digital command centers in people's homes. Google's Assistant, Apple's Siri and Amazon's Alexa can perform tasks and control appliances that have nothing do with entertainment.\nRoku could fall even further behind before its assistant reaches home. Although it was announced Wednesday, the assistant won't be released until this fall as part of a software update.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-03T16:17:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-03T19:42:18.110+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
