A State Department spokeswoman said North Korea “might be trying to drive a wedge” between Washington and Seoul. \nKim ordered the reopening of the hotline at the truce village of Panmunjom at 0630 GMT on Wednesday, when South Korean officials at the border received a call from the North, the South’s unification ministry said in a text message. \nOfficials on both sides were checking the line and conducting a conversation for about 20 minutes, the contents of which were not disclosed by the ministry. \nThere was no immediate U.S. comment, although a State Department spokeswoman, Katina Adams, said Washington remained in close contact with Seoul “about a unified response to North Korea.” \nShe said that as South Korea President Moon Jae-in had stated, “‘the improvement of relations between North and South Korea cannot advance separately from resolving North Korea’s nuclear program.'” \nThe reopening of the line, which North Korea shut down in February 2016, came only hours after Trump, who has repeatedly mocked Kim as “Little Rocket Man”, ridiculed the North Korean leader again on Twitter. \n“Will someone from his depleted and food-starved regime please inform him that I too have a Nuclear Button, but it is a much bigger & more powerful one than his, and my Button works!” Trump tweeted. \nTrump and Kim have exchanged insults in recent months, raising alarm worldwide, with Trump at times dismissing the prospect of a diplomatic solution to a crisis in which both sides have threatened to destroy each other. \nOn Wednesday, U.S. Vice President Mike Pence told the Voice of America Trump was responding to Kim’s New Year comment about having a nuclear button on his desk, and making clear that “America will not be bullied, America will not be threatened.” \nPence said that while all options remain on the table, there was the opportunity for a peaceable solution to the crisis if “North Korea will abandon their nuclear and ballistic missile ambitions, if they will dismantle those programs.” \nFormer Vice President Joe Biden was quoted as saying by CNN that Trump had shown “really poor judgment” with the tweet.

This is not about, you know, can I puff my chest out.” \n“The United States has a role in the world that the world has come to expect. I think the president is much, much too cavalier. And it’s dangerous.” \nWhile appearing to open the door to discussing taking part in the Winter Olympics, Kim also warned he would push ahead with “mass producing” nuclear warheads in defiance of U.N. sanctions. \nHis New Year’s Day speech came after a steep increase in missile launches in 2017, as well as the North’s sixth and most powerful nuclear test.

The United States stations 28,500 troops in the South, a legacy of the 1950-53 Korean War.
