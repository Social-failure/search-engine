The Frenchman was found guilty by an independent disciplinary panel and has the right to appeal the decision. \nStade Francais centre Danty, who has four caps for France, has been called up to replace Bastareaud, who can return to action on Feb. 4. \nBordeaux flyhalf Matthieu Jalibert received his first call-up while uncapped Danny Priso, Cedate Gomes Sa, Felix Lambey, Marco Tauleign and Geoffrey Palis were also chosen. \nAlong with Bastareaud, veterans Francois Trinh-Duc and Louis Picamoles are the other most notable absentees in Brunel’s squad. \nFrance start their Six Nations campaign against Ireland at home on Feb. 3 with the competition ending on March 17. \nSquad: \nBacks \nAnthony Jelonch (Castres), Felix Lambey (LOU), Remi Lamerat (Clermont), Wenceslas Lauret (Racing 92), Sekou Macalou (French Stage), Maxime Machenaud (Racing 92), Geoffrey Palis (Castres), Morgan Parra (Clermont), Jefferson Poirot (UBB), Dany Priso (La Rochelle), Rabah Slimani (Clermont), Marco Tauleigne (UBB), Teddy Thomas (Racing 92), Cristopher Tolofua (Saracens), Sebastien Vahaamahina (Clermont), Virimi Vakatawa (Racing 92) \nForwards \nJonathan Danty (Stade Français Paris), Anthony Belleau (Toulon), Eddy Ben Arous (Racing 92), Yacouba Camara (Montpellier), Camille Chat (Racing 92), Henry Chavancy (Racing 92), Geoffrey Doumayrou (La Rochelle), Brice Dulin ( Racing 92), Antoine Dupont (Toulouse), Benjamin Fall (Montpellier), Paul Gabrillagues (Stade Français), Cedate Gomes Sa (Racing 92), Kevin Gourdon (La Rochelle), Guilhem Guirado (Toulon), Arthur Iturria (Clermont), Matthieu Jalibert (UBB) Reporting by Aditi Prakash in Bengaluru; Editing by Ken Ferris and Christian Radnedge", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-17T18:13:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-17T18:57:59.026+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
