Not many investors have tendered their shares yet, but usually large institutional investors do it at a later stage of an offer,” said Petri Gostowski, analyst at research firm Inderes, who has a “reduce” rating on Fortum stock. \nInvestment bank UBS said last week that Fortum could also gain control of Uniper by proposing a domination agreement, or by launching a second bid for the remaining stake at a premium.
