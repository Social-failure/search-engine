The company’s basic earnings for the quarter was 22.55 rupees per share, it said.\nProfit rose 38.3 percent to 51.29 billion rupees ($806 million) in the three months ended Dec. 31, Infosys said on Friday. That compared with analysts' average estimate of 37.10 billion rupees, according to Thomson Reuters data. ( bit.ly/2qSWIVS )\nRevenue from operations rose 3 percent to 177.9 billion rupees from a year earlier, with revenue from the financial services segment down 0.4 percent at 46.43 billion rupees, the company said.\nInfosys also maintained its expectation for full-year revenue growth of between 5.5 and 6.5 percent.\nThis is the first result announcement since Salil Parekh took over as CEO this month. His predecessor Vishal Sikka quit late last year after a long-drawn public fued with Infosys’ founders.
