The country is the world's biggest oil producer and one of the key backers, together with the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), in cutting supplies.\nAs part of the supply cut deal, Russia pledged to reduce its output by 300,000 bpd from the 30-year monthly high of 11.247 million bpd hit in October 2016, which it achieved by the second quarter of 2017, according to Russian energy ministry data.\nFor the whole of 2017, however, Russian output rose to an average of 10.98 million bpd, compared with 10.96 million bpd in 2016 and 10.72 million bpd in 2015.\n\"Even though they have reduced that astronomical number (from Oct. 2016), they are still producing more (in 2017 than in 2016),\" said Matt Stanley, a fuel broker at Freight Investor Services (FIS) in Dubai.\nSaxo Bank's Hansen said he also had \"some concerns about the Chinese economy in 2018 that ultimately could lead to lower than expected demand growth.\"\nAs a result, he said his bank saw lower crude prices by the end of the year, with Brent at $60 per barrel and WTI at $57.\n(Reporting by Henning Gloystein; Editing by Richard Pullin and Christian Schmollinger)", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-03T09:53:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-03T16:03:53.009+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
