The WTO judges agreed that India had broken the trade rules by requiring solar power developers to use Indian-made cells and modules.\nIn a separate move that could protect its solar industry from global competitors, not only U.S. rivals, India told the WTO last week that it was considering the case for imposing temporary emergency tariffs on solar cells, modules and panels, after a petition from the domestic industry.\nSo-called safeguard tariffs are permitted by the WTO if there is evidence of serious harm, or threat of serious harm, to a country’s production from a sudden, unforeseen surge in imports.\nIndia said the market share of imports had increased from 86 percent in 2014-15 to 90 percent in 2017-18, with growing losses for Indian producers and a fourfold rise in inventory levels.\nThat amounted to prima facie evidence of serious injury to Indian firms, India said in the WTO filing.\nReporting by Tom Miles\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-01-09T02:33:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-09T16:57:14.015+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
