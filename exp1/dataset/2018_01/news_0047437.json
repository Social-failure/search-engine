Our team members look forward to closing these acquisitions in the first half of 2018. Southwest and Sunshine represent continued execution of our strategic vision of creating a regional community bank focused on being nimble and responsive to the needs of our clients and generating substantial returns for our shareholders.”\nBalance Sheet\nConsolidated assets increased $25.4 million to $1.813 billion at December 31, 2017, due primarily to the receipt of $55.2 million in proceeds related to the capital raise, offset by a reduction in public fund deposits of $38.1 million due to the seasonality of this portfolio.\nTotal loans were $1.225 billion at December 31, 2017, as compared to $1.198 billion at September 30, 2017, and $867.1 million at December 31, 2016, representing increases of $27.1 million or 2.3%, and $358.3 million or 41.3%, respectively. Increased loan volume of $27.1 million for the fourth quarter of 2017 was primarily distributed among all real estate categories. The acquisitions of Gulf Coast Community Bank and Iberville Bank accounted for $239.6 million of the total increase in loans as compared to the fourth quarter of 2016.\nTotal deposits were $1.471 billion at December 31, 2017, as compared to $1.508 billion at September 30, 2017, and $1.039 billion at December 31, 2016, representing a decrease of $37.4 million or 2.5%, and an increase of $431.4 million or 41.5%, respectively. The sequential-quarter decrease was primarily due to a decrease in NOW accounts of $38.1 million, which is attributable to the seasonality of the public fund deposits. The acquisitions of Gulf Coast Community Bank and Iberville Bank accounted for $335.1 million of the total increase in deposits as compared to the fourth quarter in 2016.\nAsset Quality\nNonperforming assets totaled $13.5 million at December 31, 2017, a decrease of $1.1 million compared to $14.6 million at September 30, 2017 and an increase of $3.6 million compared to December 31, 2016. The majority of the increase in same quarter comparison is the result of acquired assets with associated fair value marks. The ratio of the allowance for loan and leases losses (ALLL) to total loans was 0.68% at December 31, 2017 and September 30, 2017. Including valuation accounting adjustments on acquired loans, the total valuation plus ALLL was 1.11% of total loans at December 31, 2017. The ratio of annualized net charge-offs (recoveries) to total loans was 0.003% for the quarter ended December 31, 2017 compared to (0.005%) for the quarter ended September 30, 2017.\nFourth Quarter 2017 vs. Fourth Quarter 2016 Earnings Comparison\nNet income available to common shareholders for the fourth quarter of 2017 totaled $2.4 million compared to $2.1 million for the fourth quarter of 2016, an increase of $0.3 million or 14.3%.\nOperating net earnings for the fourth quarter of 2017 totaled $4.7 million compared to $2.4 million for the fourth quarter of 2016, an increase of $2.3 million or 97.6%.

Net interest income for the fourth quarter of 2017 was $15.2 million, an increase of $4.5 million when compared to the fourth quarter of 2016. The increase is primarily due to interest income earned on a higher volume of loans. Net interest margin for the fourth quarter of 2017 was 3.71% as compared to 3.68% for the same quarter in 2016.\nNon-interest income increased $0.9 million for the fourth quarter of 2017 as compared to the fourth quarter of 2016 due to increased service charges and interchange fee income.\nFourth quarter 2017 non-interest expense increased $2.3 million, or 22.3% as compared to fourth quarter 2016. The majority of the increase is due to higher compensation expense, occupancy expense and other non-interest expense. Salaries increased $1.5 million, of which $1.3 million resulted from increased employment as a result of the acquisitions. Occupancy and other non-interest expense of $0.7 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 was attributable to the acquisitions.\nFully tax equivalent (“FTE”) net interest income totaled $15.5 million and $10.9 million for the fourth quarter of 2017 and 2016, respectively. FTE net interest income increased $4.6 million in the prior year quarterly comparison primarily due to an increase in interest earned on loans. Purchase accounting adjustments accounted for $0.3 million of the difference in net interest income for the fourth quarter comparisons. Fourth quarter 2017 FTE net interest margin of 3.79% includes 3 basis points related to purchase accounting adjustments.\nInvestment securities totaled $372.9 million, or 20.6% of total assets at December 31, 2017, versus $255.8 million, or 20.0% of total assets at December 31, 2016.

The investment portfolio had a net unrealized loss of $0.6 million at December 31, 2017 as compared to $1.7 million at December 31, 2016.\nThe average yield on all earnings assets increased 8 basis points in prior year quarterly comparison, from 4.17% for the fourth quarter of 2016 to 4.25% for the fourth quarter of 2017. This increase was offset partially by an increase in average interest expense of 9 basis points from 0.51% for the fourth quarter of 2016 to 0.60% for the fourth quarter of 2017.\nFourth Quarter 2017 vs Third Quarter 2017 Earnings Comparison\nOperating net earnings for the fourth quarter of 2017 compared to the third quarter of 2017 remained constant at $4.7 million.\nNet interest income for the fourth quarter of 2017 was $15.2 million. FTE net interest income increased $0.3 million to $15.5 million from $15.2 million in sequential-quarter comparison. The increase was due primarily to increased loan volume. Interest income from purchase accounting adjustments decreased slightly in sequential quarter comparison.\nThe average yield on all earnings assets remained unchanged in sequential-quarter comparison at 4.25%. Average interest expense increased 5 basis points from 0.55% for the third quarter of 2017 to 0.60% for the fourth quarter of 2017.\nNon-interest income decreased $0.1 million in sequential-quarter comparison resulting from decreased mortgage income of $0.1 million.\nNon-interest expense increased $0.5 million in sequential-quarter comparison, which reflects increases in salaries and employee benefits and other professional services. Merger-related costs of $0.4 million were included in other professional services for the fourth quarter of 2017.\nYear to Date Earnings Comparison\nIn year-over-year comparison, net income available to common shareholders increased $0.9 million, or 9.8%, from $9.7 million at December 31, 2016 to $10.6 million at December 31, 2017.

Net interest income increased $18.9 million in year-over-year comparison as interest income earned on a higher volume of loans attributed to this overall increase.\nNon-interest income was $14.4 million at December 31, 2017, an increase of $3.1 million in year-over-year comparison consisting of increases in service charges on deposit accounts, interchange fee income and other charges and fees.\nNon-interest expense was $55.4 million at December 31, 2017, an increase of $18.6 million in year-over-year comparison primarily resulting from increases in salaries and benefits of $8.4 million, of which $6.7 million relates to the acquisitions. Increases in other professional services and other non-interest expense increased $8.8 million which includes $6.7 million in merger-related costs.\nDeclaration of Cash Dividend\nThe Company announced that its Board of Directors declared a cash dividend in the amount of $0.05 per share, an increase of $0.0125 per share, or 33.3%, to be paid on its common stock on February 22, 2018 to shareholders of record as of the close of business on February 5, 2018.\nAbout The First Bancshares, Inc.\nThe First Bancshares, Inc., headquartered in Hattiesburg, Mississippi, is the parent company of The First, A National Banking Association.

The Company believes that the non-GAAP financial measures included in this press release allow management and investors to understand and compare results in a more consistent manner for the periods presented in this press release. Non-GAAP financial measures should be considered supplemental and not a substitute for the Company’s results reported in accordance with GAAP for the periods presented, and other bank holding companies may define or calculate these measures differently. These non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered in isolation and do not purport to be an alternative to net income, earnings per share, net interest income, book value or other GAAP financial measures as a measure of operating performance. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most comparable GAAP measure is provided in this press release following the Condensed Consolidated Financial Information (unaudited).\nForward Looking Statements\nThis news release contains statements regarding the projected performance of The First Bancshares, Inc. and its subsidiary.
