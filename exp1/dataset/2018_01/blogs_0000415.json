That's also a fall from the $14,156 it hit Sunday, according to coinmarketcap.com, which tracks daily prices.\nBitcoin got off to a much stronger start last year, and then kept that momentum going, eventually creating a global frenzy for cryptocurrencies. In a sign of its phenomenal price gain in 2017, it rose 3.6 percent on the first day of 2017 to $998, data from coinmarketcap.com show. It ended the year up more than 1,300 percent.\nThat rally drew a growing number of competitors and last month brought bitcoin to Wall Street in the form of futures contracts. It reached the Dec. 18 peak hours after CME Group Inc. debuted its derivatives agreements, which some traders said would encourage short position-taking.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-01T21:22:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-02T15:55:19.016+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
