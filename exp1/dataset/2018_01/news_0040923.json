(NYSE: AMC) from December 20, 2016 through August 1, 2017, inclusive (the “Class Period”), including purchasers in AMC’s secondary public offering on or about February 8, 2017 of the important March 13, 2018 lead plaintiff deadline.

YOU MAY RETAIN COUNSEL OF YOUR CHOICE.\nAccording to the lawsuit, defendants during the Class Period made materially false and/or misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that: (1) the operations of Carmike Cinemas, Inc., a company acquired by AMC, had been experiencing a prolonged period of financial underperformance due to a protracted period of underinvestment in its theaters; (2) Carmike had experienced a significant loss in market share when its loyal patrons migrated to competitors that had renovated and upgraded their theaters; (3) AMC was able to retain only a very small number of Carmike’s loyalty program members after the Carmike acquisition; (4) these issues were having a material adverse effect on Carmike’s operations and theater attendance; and (5) as a result of defendants’ statements and/or omissions, the price of AMC common shares was artificially inflated during the relevant period. When the true details entered the market, the lawsuit claims that investors suffered damages.\nA class action lawsuit has already been filed. If you wish to serve as lead plaintiff, you must move the Court no later than March 13, 2018.
