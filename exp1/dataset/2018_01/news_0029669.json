REUTERS/Tyrone Siu \nXinhua however did not explicitly say what might be amended when it came to the supervision commission. \nFighting deeply ingrained graft had been a key policy plank for Xi in his first term in office and that battle will take on a new hue with the setting up of the National Supervision Commission as he begins his second term. \nTrial work has already begun for that commission, which is likely to be formally codified in law in March at a meeting of China’s largely rubber stamp parliament. \nBecause the state constitution is being amended, it needs parliament to formally approve it, probably at the March session, though it could happen before. Xinhua did not say exactly when it would happen. \nWhether Xi was able to have his name “crowned” in the party constitution had been seen as a key measure of his power, elevating him to a level of previous leaders exemplified by Mao Zedong Thought and Deng Xiaoping Theory. \nNo other leader since Mao has had an eponymous ideology included in the document while in office. Deng’s name was added after his death in 1997. \nThe state constitution was last amended in 2004 to include guarantees to protect private property and human rights. \nWhile it theoretically offers broad guarantees to things like freedom of speech, religion and association, rights groups say in practice these are ignored. It also highlights the primacy of the Communist Party in leading China.
