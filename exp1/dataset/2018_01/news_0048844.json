When the Bears trimmed a 58-42 deficit down to 58-48 with just under 11 minutes left, Hudson responded with eight consecutive points, six on back-to-back 3-pointers, to put Florida up by 18.\nFlorida’s biggest lead was 24 points, 75-51, with just over four minutes left.\nThe Gators came out firing, hitting eight of their first nine 3-point attempts in building a 37-22 lead with just under five minutes left in the first half. The Bears were within 40-31 in the final minute, but guard KeVaughn Allen’s 3-pointer at the buzzer got Florida back up by double digits 43-31 at the break.\nThe Gators shot 58.3 percent (14-of-24) overall and 75 percent (9-of-12) on 3s in the first half while the Bears were 12-of-30 (40.0 percent) overall and 22.2 percent (2-of-9) from behind the arc.\n-- Field Level Media\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-01-28T03:25:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-29T11:49:14.024+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
