It follows an earlier round in December in which Alibaba also participated.\nXiaopeng, which debuted its electric car at CES in Las Vegas this month, is one of several Chinese start-ups looking to speed up development of battery-powered technology and compete with global leaders including Tesla Inc.\nChina’s new energy vehicle sales are expected to grow by 40 percent in 2018, according to an industry body, even as the country’s traditional automotive market slowed sharply in 2017.\nThe logo of Foxconn, the trading name of Hon Hai Precision Industry, is seen on top of the company's headquarters in New Taipei City, Taiwan March 29, 2016.
