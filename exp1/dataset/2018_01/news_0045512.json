The weapons maker said its 2018 net sales would be in the range of $26.4 billion-$26.9 billion, beating the Wall Street expectation of $26.63 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.\nThe company also said it expects 2018 operating cash flow from continuing operations to be between $3.6 billion and $4.0 billion, compared with $2.7 billion in 2017.\nRaytheon and other U.S. weapons makers are expected to benefit in the coming year from an increase in overall defense spending under President Donald Trump’s administration.\nSales at Raytheon’s missile systems unit, its biggest by revenue, rose 15.2 percent to about $2.19 billion in the quarter ended Dec. 31, helped by higher sales of medium-range air-to-air missiles, Paveway laser-guided bombs and SM-3 anti-ballistic missiles.\nSales in Raytheon’s space and airborne systems business, its second-biggest, rose 4.4 percent to $1.67 billion, helped by higher sales of airborne radars.\nThe unit makes electronic warfare systems for tactical aircraft, helicopters and ships as well as tracking and navigation sensors used on airborne platforms.\nRaytheon’s overall sales rose to $6.78 billion in the quarter, from $6.28 billion, a year earlier, narrowly missing the Street estimate of $6.81 billion.\nHowever, income from continuing operations attributable to Raytheon fell to $393 million, or $1.35 per share, from $555 million, or $1.87 per share, a year earlier.\nRaytheon said its fourth-quarter profit included a provision of $171 million for tax-related expense and a $1 billion pre-tax discretionary pension plan contribution, which was not included in the company’s prior forecast.
