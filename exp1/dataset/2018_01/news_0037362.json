The Hawks had won three of four coming in.\nChicago was up 55-38 at halftime and led by as many as 25 in the second half.\nA cutting dunk from John Collins with 2:04 to play in the third quarter brought the Hawks within 71-61, but the Bulls ended the period with a 77-63 advantage.\nAtlanta never held a lead in the game.\nMarkkanen’s key 3-pointer with 48.5 seconds left keyed the Bulls’ 91-86 victory against the Hawks in Chicago in their first meeting on Oct. 26. The rookie had 14 points and 12 boards in that contest.\nChicago continues its three-game road trip Monday in New Orleans. Atlanta plays the fourth of six straight games at home Monday versus Utah.\n--Field Level Media\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-01-21T08:39:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-21T13:20:11.017+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
