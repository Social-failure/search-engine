Protesters wave the EU and Union flags outside the Palace of Westminster, London, Britain, December 20, 2017. REUTERS/Peter Nicholls \nThe risk of changes in legislation and regulation, including concerns over Brexit, new trade barriers and protectionism, climbed three places from a year earlier to become the second most significant concern for UK businesses, according to the UK part of a global survey by German insurer Allianz ( ALVG.DE ) \n“Companies must gear up to cope with the risk of sudden political and legal shocks, such as the lack of clarity over UK Plc’s future relationship with the European Union,” said Brian Kirwan, UK Chief Executive of Allianz Global Corporate & Specialty. \nCyber incidents were again the top worry for UK businesses, including the potential for “cyber hurricanes”, where hackers disrupt large numbers of companies through shared internet infrastructure. \nBusiness interruption was considered the primary risk globally in the Allianz survey of more than 1,900 risk specialists from 80 countries.
