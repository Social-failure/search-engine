Joe Kennedy III delivered a broad rebuke of President Donald Trump 's policies on Tuesday night, downplaying the president's effect on the U.S. economy and pushing back on his immigration goals. \nIn the official Democratic response to Trump's first State of the Union address, the Massachusetts Democrat also said that \"bullies\" cannot \"match the strength and spirit of a people united in defense of their future.\" \nTrump spent much of his speech to Congress touting economic figures as evidence of his administration's success. He highlighted stock market gains, job growth and tax cuts to show what he has done for Americans. \nSpeaking to vocational students in Fall River, Mass., the congressman argued that Trump's policies have not done enough to help American workers.
