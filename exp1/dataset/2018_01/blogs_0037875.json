Shares traded around $53 a share on Tuesday, down from a fresh 52-week intraday high of $54.60 after quarterly earnings were released.\nThe announcement comes after Verizon hinted in its morning earnings report that \"employees will further share in the company's success\" around tax reform. Verizon expects savings from tax reform will add $3.5 billion to $4 billion to its operating cash flow this year, boosting earnings by 55 to 65 cents a share for the full year.\n\"I just left the employee meeting where we decided what we were going to do with the $3.5 billion to $4 billion,\" McAdam said.\nThat's on top of a previously announced one-time increase of about $16.8 billion under the new tax scheme.\nThe company also plans to put money into dividends, paying down debt, philanthropy and investing in the network.

In the media business, Yahoo and AOL are competing against concentrated media and tech giants for advertising dollars. And as the few remaining wireless providers compete for phone customers, new features like spectrum and data plans are more important than ever.\nWhile other players in the industry are considering mergers, McAdam said that Verizon is keeping its options open as an independent company that can partner with anyone.\n\"Scale matters in this game, and if you're going to jump in, you don't jump in in a small way,\" McAdam said. \"I think there's a real, legitimate strategy for being the big digital media deliverer.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-23T19:24:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-23T19:35:04.028+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
