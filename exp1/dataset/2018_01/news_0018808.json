His ability to anticipate trends and his connections at the highest levels allowed FleishmanHillard to undertake some of the most innovative and memorable campaigns in China's PR history.\n\"His lasting achievements are many: for example, he actively supported the firm's Global China Practice when it was launched in 2012, helping to grow outbound business from China to the worldwide network to support the cross-border expansion of Chinese industry leaders. Today, many of our Chinese clients are global leaders and feature prominently on the Fortune 500, and we are proud to serve them.\"\nLi Hong's tenure has been recognized with many awards including the Greater China Agency of the Year award from The Holmes Report in 2013.\n\"Over the past year, since Rachel Catanach's appointment to president of Greater China, Li Hong has played an important advisory role, counselling clients at the senior-most level, mentoring top talent, and championing network collaboration and partnership for further expansion of the business. We wish him and his family all the best for this next chapter.

This new role recognizes the need for innovative management of resources in a complex and dynamic environment. Lichi is a natural bridge-builder and her infectious enthusiasm and energy, combined with a strong business drive, will position us well to capture growth in this next phase of our development in China,\" said Catanach.\nLiu, who is currently the Shanghai office's deputy general manager and head of FleishmanHillard's corporate and public affairs team in Shanghai, will be promoted to general manager of the Shanghai office.\nLiu joined FleishmanHillard Shanghai in 2012 and has significant expertise in stakeholder identification and engagement, government policy analysis, corporate reputation management, and issues and crisis management.
