Yes, we have more investments into defense, four visits to Europe during the year, more (American) defense capabilities in Europe, but of course rhetoric sometimes is very much controversial.\"\nTrump has often said he supports the U.K.'s decision to leave the European Union — something that certain EU leaders may dislike. The U.S. president has also accused Germany of manipulating the euro for an advantage in global trade. Also, he has told European countries that they need to increase their funding to NATO .\nBut in the eyes of Lithuania's presidency, Trump's words haven't been backed up by actions.\n\"If you only read tweets you can have one picture, but if you look to the activity of the administration and (the) real results, you have a different picture,\" she said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-25T16:51:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-25T16:16:24.023+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
