He also said customers expect the right to leave lower tips for poor service.\n“The fact that tipping is a well-accepted social norm does not defeat plaintiffs’ claims,” Oetken wrote.\n“This being New York City, 15 percent may indeed be a threshold beneath which no self-respecting diner would dip,” he added. “Nevertheless, the social norm is that tips are expected but subject to the customer’s discretion. At least that is what the complaint alleges.”\nOetken said it didn’t matter that mandatory tips might prevent wait staff from being “stiffed by uninformed tourists.”\nLawyers for Apple-Metro had no immediate comment. Lawyers for Ghee and Shen did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Applebee’s parent DineEquity Inc is not a defendant.\nThe case is Ghee et al v Apple-Metro Inc et al, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York, No. 17-05723.\nReporting by Jonathan Stempel in New York; Editing by David Gregorio\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-26T22:55:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-26T23:11:24.001+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
