(Nasdaq:CNOB) (the “Company” or “ConnectOne”), parent company of ConnectOne Bank (the “Bank”), today reported net income of $10.6 million for the fourth quarter of 2017 compared with $13.1 million for the third quarter of 2017 and a $2.0 million loss during the fourth quarter of 2016. Diluted earnings per share were $0.33 for the current quarter versus $0.41 earned in the third quarter of 2017 and a $0.07 loss in the fourth quarter of 2016.\nAdjusted net income amounted to $16.3 million, or $0.51 earnings per share, for the fourth quarter of 2017; $14.9 million, or $0.46 earnings per share, for the third quarter of 2017; and $12.2 million, or $0.40 earnings per share, for the fourth quarter of 2016. The fourth quarter 2017 adjusted net income excludes an estimated $5.6 million deferred tax asset (“DTA”) valuation charge related to the Tax Cuts & Jobs Act of 2017 (“Tax Act”). Adjusted net income also excludes taxi medallion after-tax charges of $0.2 million for the fourth quarter 2017, $1.8 million for the third quarter of 2017, and $14.2 million for the fourth quarter 2016.\nFrank Sorrentino, ConnectOne’s Chairman and Chief Executive Officer stated, “We are proud to announce that ConnectOne achieved another important milestone, crossing over the $5 billion mark in total assets. Driven by organic growth, this reflects a 20.0% year-over-year increase in loans receivable, net of loan sales. For the fourth quarter, on an annualized basis, average total deposits grew by 19.6%, essentially matching our loan growth. Deposit pricing competition continues to be fierce; however, we have largely offset the increase in funding costs with higher yields on loans combined with strong growth in noninterest-bearing demand deposits. Our fourth quarter 2017 adjusted net interest margin, which excludes purchase accounting accretable yield, remained essentially flat on a sequential basis at 3.42%. Meanwhile, tax reform resulted in an estimated DTA write-down of $5.6 million recorded in the fourth quarter of 2017, but will positively impact our earnings in 2018 through a significantly lower effective tax rate. Excluding the DTA charge for the fourth quarter of 2017, return on average assets exceeded 1.30% and return on tangible common equity exceeded 15%, both record performance metrics for the Company. We also continue to make significant strides in improving our commercial real estate (“CRE”) concentration metrics. The drivers, which have reduced the metric by approximately 60 percentage points, include continued momentum in non-CRE loan growth capabilities, the sale of approximately $50 million of non-relationship multifamily loans (which resulted in a gain on sale of approximately $550 thousand), and the previously announced $75 million subordinated debt offering completed in early January 2018.”\nMr. Sorrentino added, “We enter 2018 sharply focused on our strategic priorities and are well-positioned to continue to improve our performance and increase our competitive advantage. I am confident we will continue to attract additional bankers and support staff to our organization and will continue to invest in our infrastructure. Our enhanced capabilities and new technologies, coupled with growth in our teams, will serve all our clients well in the coming year.”\nOperating Results\nFully taxable equivalent net interest income for the fourth quarter of 2017 was $40.7 million, an increase of $2.8 million, or 7.4%, from the third quarter of 2017, resulting from an increase in average interest-earning assets of 5.1% and the widening of the net interest margin to 3.51% from 3.44%. Included in net interest income was accretion and amortization of purchase accounting adjustments of $1.0 million and $0.3 million during the fourth and third quarters of 2017, respectively, with the increase resulting from accelerated purchase accounting income accretion. Excluding purchase accounting adjustments, the adjusted net interest margin was 3.42% in the fourth quarter of 2017, widening by 1 basis-point from the third quarter 2017 adjusted net interest margin of 3.41%. The increase in net interest margin was primarily attributable to higher yields on loans largely offset by increased deposit funding costs.\nFully taxable equivalent net interest income for the fourth quarter of 2017 increased by $6.6 million, or 19.4%, from the fourth quarter of 2016, resulting from an increase in average interest-earning assets of 14.0% and the widening of the net interest margin by 15 basis-points to 3.51% from 3.36%. Included in net interest income was accretion and amortization of purchase accounting adjustments of $1.0 million during the fourth quarter of 2017 and 2016. Excluding these purchase accounting adjustments, the adjusted net interest margin was 3.42% in the fourth quarter of 2017, widening by 15 basis-points from the fourth quarter of 2016 adjusted net interest margin of 3.27%. The increase in the adjusted net interest margin was primarily attributable to a lower volume of cash balances resulting in an improved asset-mix, partially offset by increases in deposit funding costs, as well as lower yields on securities.\nNoninterest income totaled $2.0 million in the fourth quarter of 2017, $1.8 million in the third quarter of 2017 and $1.6 million in the fourth quarter of 2016. The most recent quarter included a $0.5 million gain on sale of non-relationship multifamily loans, and the third quarter 2017 included a $0.3 million bank owned life insurance death benefit.\nNoninterest expenses totaled $16.6 million for the fourth quarter of 2017, a decrease of $2.0 million from $18.6 million for the third quarter of 2017 and an increase of $1.3 million from $15.3 million for the fourth quarter of 2016. The decrease from the prior sequential quarter was mainly attributable to the valuation allowance adjustment on taxi medallion loans held-for-sale, which declined to $0.3 million in the current quarter from $3.0 million in the third quarter of 2017, offset by increases salaries and employee benefits, primarily bonus accruals for non-executives ($0.5 million) and other expenses ($0.2 million). The increase in noninterest expenses from the prior year fourth quarter was mainly attributable to increases in salaries and employee benefits ($1.5 million) and a valuation allowance adjustment on taxi medallion loans held-for-sale ($0.3 million), offset by decreases in FDIC insurance expense ($0.1 million), professional and consulting ($0.2 million) and occupancy and equipment expenses ($0.2 million). The increases over the prior year fourth quarter were the result of increased levels of business and staff resulting from organic growth.\nIncome tax expense was $12.7 million for the fourth quarter of 2017, compared to $5.6 million for the third quarter of 2017 and a $3.4 million benefit for the fourth quarter of 2016. Included in income tax expense for the fourth quarter of 2017 is an estimated $5.6 million DTA valuation charge related to the Tax Act. In addition, there was an approximately $0.2 million income tax benefit recorded during the fourth quarter of 2017, which resulted from the effect of ASU 2016-09, Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting . At the present time, the Bank is projecting a 2018 effective tax rate of approximately 22%.\nAsset Quality\nThe provision for loan losses was $2.0 million in the fourth quarter of 2017, $1.5 million in the third quarter of 2017 and $25.2 million in the fourth quarter of 2016. The increase from the prior sequential quarter was largely attributable to higher loan growth. The prior year quarter included $24.0 of provision for loan losses related to the taxi medallion loan portfolio.\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2017, the Bank’s entire taxi medallion loan portfolio was transferred back to loans held-for-investment from the held-for-sale designation. As of December 31, 2017, the loans secured by NYC taxi medallions, predominantly corporate medallions, had a carrying value of $46.8 million, compared to $65.6 million as of December 31, 2016. The decrease was primarily attributable to valuation adjustments related to reduced medallion lease revenues, lower transfer valuations as reported by the New York City Taxi and Limousine Commission, and overall weakness in the NYC taxi industry. As of December 31, 2017, the medallion loans had a per medallion carrying value of $343,000, compared to $348,000 as of September 30, 2017.\nNonperforming assets, which includes nonaccrual loans and other real estate owned, were $66.2 million at December 31, 2017, $61.2 million at September 30, 2017 and $69.4 million at December 31, 2016. Included in nonperforming assets were taxi medallion loans totaling $46.8 million at December 31, 2017, $47.4 million at September 30, 2017 and $63.0 million at December 31, 2016. Nonperforming assets as a percentage of total assets were 1.29% at December 31, 2017, 1.26% at September 30, 2017 and 1.57% at December 31, 2016.\nExcluding the taxi medallion loans, nonaccrual loans were $18.8 million at December 31, 2017, $13.8 million at September 30, 2017 and $5.7 million at December 31, 2016. The increase in nonaccruals from the prior sequential quarter is primarily attributable to one, well-secured, commercial real estate loan that was added to nonaccrual during the quarter, offset by two nonaccrual loans that were paid-off without loss or charge-off. Excluding taxi medallion loans, nonaccrual loans as a percentage of loans receivable were 0.46% at December 31, 2017, 0.35% at September 30, 2017 and 0.16% at December 31, 2016.\nThe net charge-off ratio was 0.01% for the fourth quarter of 2017, 0.00% for the third quarter of 2017 and 4.23% for the fourth quarter of 2016. The allowance for loan losses represented 0.76%, 0.77%, and 0.74% of loans receivable as of December 31, 2017, September 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016, respectively. The allowance for loan losses as a percentage of nonaccrual loans, excluding taxi medallion loans, was 168.4% as of December 31, 2017, 217.2% as of September 30, 2017and 449.0% as of December 31, 2016.\nSelected Balance Sheet Items\nAt December 31, 2017, the Company’s total assets were $5.1 billion, an increase of $682 million from December 31, 2016. Loans receivable at December 31, 2017 were $4.2 billion, reflecting net loan growth (loan originations less pay-downs and pay-offs) of $696 million (includes $47 million of taxi medallion loans transferred back to loans held-for-investment) from December 31, 2016, primarily attributable to increases in multifamily ($353 million), commercial and industrial ($228 million, including the aforementioned transfer of $47 million of taxi medallion loans), other commercial real estate ($78 million), and residential real estate ($39 million), offset by a slight decrease in construction ($3 million).\nThe Company’s stockholders’ equity was $565 million at December 31, 2017, an increase of $34 million from December 31, 2016. The increase in stockholders’ equity was primarily attributable to an increase of $34 million in retained earnings and approximately $2 million of equity issuance related to stock-based compensation, offset by increases in other comprehensive losses of $1 million. As of December 31, 2017, the Company’s tangible common equity ratio and tangible book value per share were 8.41% and $13.01, respectively. As of December 31, 2016, the tangible common equity ratio and tangible book value per share were 8.93% and $11.96, respectively. Total goodwill and other intangible assets were approximately $148 million and $149 million as of December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, respectively.\nUse of Non-GAAP Financial Measures\nIn addition to the results presented in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (\"GAAP\"), ConnectOne routinely supplements its evaluation with an analysis of certain non-GAAP/adjusted financial measures including an adjusted net income available to common shareholders.
