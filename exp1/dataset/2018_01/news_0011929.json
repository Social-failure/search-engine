Farrell suffered a sprained ankle last week and missed his second straight game. Fighting Irish coach Mike Brey hopes Farrell can get back next week.\nColson, who was leading Notre Dame in scoring and rebounding, will be out much longer, after fracturing a bone in his foot on Dec. 29. The All-American is expected to miss eight weeks.\nThe Irish stayed in the game, even without their two stars, and were down 54-51 after D.J. Harvey hit a 3-pointer with four minutes to play. But Lammers hit a jumper, and Okogie scored the game’s final four points to put away the Irish (13-4, 3-1 ACC), who had their five-game winning streak snapped.\nGeorgia Tech’s defense dominated the first half, holding the Irish to just 20 points. The Yellow Jackets went into halftime with a 10-point lead, but were unable to pull away from Notre Dame.\nThe Irish’s John Mooney came off the bench to score a career-high 11 points, including a free throw midway through the second half that tied the game at 39.\nOkogie answered with a 3-pointer, igniting a 10-2 Georgia Tech run. The Yellow Jackets led the rest of the way and avenged a loss to Notre Dame in the teams’ first meeting on Dec. 30.\nThings don’t get any easier for the banged-up Irish. They host No. 20 North Carolina on Saturday.\nGeorgia Tech travels to Pittsburgh on Saturday.\n--Field Level Media\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-01-11T10:32:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-11T12:28:25.016+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
