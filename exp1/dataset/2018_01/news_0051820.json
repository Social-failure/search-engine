It was designed by Dionisio Borda, who heads his economic team and was treasury minister under former leftist President Fernando Lugo.\nAlegre said he would be more cautious with debt issuance than current President Horacio Cartes, a member of the Colorado party who is barred from seeking re-election due to constitutional term limits. Paraguay debuted in the global markets in 2013 and has since issued $2.88 billion in bonds.\n“This government’s indebtedness is unprecedented in Paraguay’s history, and it has not even brought results,” Alegre said. “Surely we will need resources to finance development projects, through credits or bond issuance, but it will be with a more ordered policy to maintain macroeconomic balance.” (Reporting by Daniela Desantis; Writing by Luc Cohen; Editing by Lisa Von Ahn)\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-01-29T22:56:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-30T18:41:29.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
