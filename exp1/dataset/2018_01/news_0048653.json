BPCE also controls French bank Natixis ( CNAT.PA ).\nCDC said in a statement to Reuters that all options were possible, including the “status quo.”\n“Nothing is decided. For La Poste, CNP Assurances, as for other our investments, we will take into account three criteria: the long-term interest of the company for its employees, general interest and the economic interest for Caisse des Depots,” CDC said in the statement\n“To sum it up, if an operation is done, it needs to make sense for the institution it (CDC) manages.”\nLa Poste and CNP Assurances declined to comment.\nThe French government owns a 73.68 percent stake in La Poste via the state holding agency APE.\n($1 = 0.8015 euros)\nReporting by Matthieu Protard; Writing by Maya Nikolaeva.
