However, immigrants fighting deportation generally do not have a similar constitutional right.\nImmigrant rights advocates have criticized the U.S. government for conducting deportation proceedings against very young children, without lawyers for the immigrant present.\nA three-judge 9th Circuit panel ruled on Monday, however, that Congress had not extended the right of free counsel to minors such as the Honduran boy, who arrived in the United States aged 13 in 2014.\nAhilan Arulanantham, legal director of the American Civil Liberties Union of Southern California who represents the boy, said they would seek a review of the decision. The court ruling would allow the government “to pit trained prosecutors against children fleeing persecution,” he said.\n“If permitted to stand, it will result in the deportation of thousands of vulnerable children to some of the most violent places on earth,” Arulanantham said.\nIn a separate concurrence, Judge John Owens called the court’s ruling “narrow” because it did not say whether minors who arrive in the U.S. unaccompanied by their parents have the right to a court-appointed lawyer.\n“That is a different question that could lead to a different answer,” he wrote.\nRepresentatives for the U.S. Department of Justice could not be reached for comment.\nReporting by Dan Levine; Editing by Lisa Von Ahn and Rosalba O'Brien\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-29T20:14:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-29T20:25:19.006+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
