Deals also took place in niche markets such as Swiss francs, Australian dollars and offshore renminbi.\nBankers said the supply spree was down to the wall of cash that investors need to deploy. “The liquidity available is ridiculous right now,” said one banker in London.\nEmerging markets bond funds received US$3.6bn of inflows over the past week, the second largest on record, according to BAML and EPFR Global.\nThat meant deals saw plenty of demand despite the volatile backdrop. Turkey was able to get a book in excess of US$5bn, Oman US$15bn, Israel over US$18bn, and even Macedonia more than €3.5bn.\nA second banker said the market is more resilient to shocks than before with big investors that never used to be on the emerging markets radar now involved in the asset class. “There’s proper institutional money underpinning it.”\nHe said that while the recent rates moves have had an impact on ETFs, real money accounts have been less affected because they are “just sitting on the sidelines waiting for deals; they are not so active in the secondary.”\nUnless rates shoot up significantly higher, potentially making borrowing costs prohibitively expensive, nothing is likely to derail primary supply in the coming months.\nAnd while central bank policy remains largely accommodative, albeit not as loose as before, bankers say it’s difficult to see what could push Treasury yields higher on a sustainable basis.\nPerhaps it will be the equity markets that lead to a change in sentiment. ”One frequently asked question is ‘what level of bond yields will cause equity markets to fall?’ said BAML analysts. “Better question is ”what level in [S&P 500] causes Fed to start hiking 50bp“... it’s not 2767.” (Editing by Julian Baker)\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-01-12T21:19:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-13T14:54:23.002+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
