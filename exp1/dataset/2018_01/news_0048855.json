More than 15,000 people have been killed and millions displaced.\nReporting by Michelle Martin, Editing by William Maclean\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-01-26T22:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-27T00:10:36.016+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
