Their bodies were found on Thursday. At least one other young man has disappeared. \nState and federal police and military forces took over security operations in Chilpancingo on Thursday after more than 100 local police officers were suspended and put under investigation in the case, a state police spokesman said on Friday. \nA growing number of criminal groups in Guerrero are battling over territory used to grow opium poppies for heroin production. Guerrero is one of the most violent states in Mexico. It is not uncommon for state, federal and military forces to replace local security forces suspected of corruption and ties to Mexicoâ€™s powerful gangs. \nOn Thursday, protests were held against local police and relatives of two missing youths told reporters they suspected police were involved in their disappearance. \nIn the nearby city of Iguala in 2014, 43 Mexican students were rounded up by corrupt police, who handed them over to a gang that burnt them in a nearby dump, according to a federal investigation. \nClashes between rival drug gangs contributed to a record high number of murders in Mexico last year. President Enrique Pena Nieto has pledged to get violence under control ahead of national elections this summer.
