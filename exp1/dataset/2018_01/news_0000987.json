That’s why, after much prayer and discussion with family and friends, I’ve decided to retire at the end of this term.” \nHatch’s decision reverses the position he took last year, when he said that his chairmanship of the tax-writing Finance Committee would make it hard for him to leave the Senate. It comes after he helped pass a sweeping $1.5 trillion tax cut last year, delivering President Donald Trump a major achievement. \nHatch, who was first elected to the U.S. Senate in 1976, is the longest-serving Republican senator.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-02T22:28:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-02T22:53:15.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
