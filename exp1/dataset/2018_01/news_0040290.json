Slideshow (5 Images) \nCilic blew one of them by spraying a crosscourt shot wide but made no mistake on the second, hammering a huge first serve down the ‘T’ and picking off the return with a straightforward forehand winner, bringing raucous cheers from the large Croatian contingent in the terraces. \nThe 2014 U.S. Open champion Cilic will meet either last year’s finalist Rafa Nadal or Argentine Diego Schwartzman for a place in the semi-finals. \n“It was an unbelievable match, a lot of ups and downs,” Cilic said in his on-court interview. \n“Pablo came back and really gave me a lot of trouble ... We had a lot of tough rallies so I was really glad how I stayed in there mentally.” Editing by Sudipto Ganguly", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-21T07:58:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-21T08:11:17.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
