Twenty people were accused of planning armed attacks against state institutions and plotting to assassinate former Prime Minister Milo Djukanovic.\nThe opposition rejected the election results, accusing the government of creating a climate of fear, and is boycotting the parliament work.\nReporting by Ivana Sekularac, editing by Larry King\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-01-19T19:38:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-19T14:12:14.014+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
