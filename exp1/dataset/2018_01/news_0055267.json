(NASDAQ:WSBF), holding company for WaterStone Bank, reported net income of $3.1 million, or $0.11 per diluted share December 31, 2017 compared to $6.4 million, or $0.23 per diluted share December 31, 2016. Net income for the year ended December 31, 2017 totaled $26.0 million, or $0.93 per diluted share compared to $25.5 million, or $0.93 per diluted share for the year ended December 31, 2016. The fourth quarter and year to date 2017 results of operations each include a $2.7 million charge to income tax expense related to the Company’s deferred tax asset revaluation that resulted from recent legislation that reduced the corporate federal income tax rate. Excluding the impact of this revaluation, net income per diluted share (1) for the quarter and year ended December 31, 2017 were $0.21 and $1.03, respectively.\n“We achieved record pre-tax earnings in 2017 fueled by a 36% increase in the pre-tax earnings of our Community Banking segment,” said Douglas Gordon, CEO of Waterstone Financial, Inc. “Annual loan growth of 9.7%, combined with a 13.6% increase in our net interest margin drove the record profits. Our Mortgage Banking segment, coming off record earnings in 2016, faced margin compression during 2017 as the lack of refinance business increased price competition within the industry. Mortgage Banking segment earnings were also hampered by the expense associated with 11 new branches opened since the fourth quarter of 2016. The strength of our consolidated earnings, and capital, gave us the ability to pay dividends totaling $0.98 per share to our shareholders during 2017”.\nHighlights of the Quarter and Year Ended December 31, 2017\nWaterstone Financial, Inc. (Consolidated)\nConsolidated pre-tax income of Waterstone Financial, Inc. totaled $9.2 million December 31, 2017, compared to $10.6 million December 31, 2016. Consolidated pre-tax income of Waterstone Financial, Inc. totaled $44.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to $42.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. Consolidated return on average assets totaled 0.67% December 31, 2017 compared to 1.44% December 31, 2016. Adjusted for the deferred tax revaluation, consolidated return on average assets (1) totaled 1.26% December 31, 2017. Consolidated return on average assets totaled 1.43% for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to 1.45% for the year ended December 31, 2016. Adjusted for the deferred tax revaluation, consolidated return on average assets (1) totaled 1.58% for the year ended December 31, 2017.

Pre-tax income of the segment totaled $28.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, which represents a 36.1% increase compared to $21.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. Net interest income of the segment totaled $13.4 million December 31, 2017, which represents an 11.8% increase compared to $12.0 million December 31, 2016. The increase in net interest income, which was driven by loan growth along with a decrease in borrowing costs, drove our net interest margin to 3.08% December 31, 2017 compared to 2.88% December 31, 2016. Average loans held for investment totaled $1.27 billion during the quarter ended December 31, 2017, which represents an increase of $111.6 million, or 9.6% over the comparable quarter in the prior year. Total loans held for investment increased $30.7 million, or 2.4%, to $1.29 billion at December 31, 2017 compared to $1.26 billion at September 30, 2017. Total deposits increased $10.6 million, or 1.1%, to $967.4 million at December 31, 2017 compared to $956.8 million at September 30, 2017. Driven by margin expansion and continued cost control efforts, the efficiency ratio for the segment improved to 48.4% December 31, 2017, compared to 51.0% December 31, 2016. Nonperforming assets as percentage of total assets decreased to 0.59% as of December 31, 2017, compared to 0.62% at September 30, 2017 and 0.89% at December 31, 2016.\nMortgage Banking Segment\nPre-tax income of the segment totaled $1.8 million December 31, 2017, which represents a 58.1% decrease compared to $4.3 million December 31, 2016.

Loans originated for the purpose of sale in the secondary market decreased $45.5 million, or 7.3%, to $577.0 million during the quarter ended December 31, 2017, compared to $622.5 million December 31, 2016. The decrease in originations was driven by a 45.6% decrease in the origination of loans made for the purpose of mortgage refinance. Driven by an expansion of our branch network, origination volumes of loans made for the purpose of residential purchases increased 6.3% compared to the comparative quarter in the prior year. Our origination efforts continue to be focused on loans made for the purpose of residential purchases, as opposed to mortgage refinance. Origination volume relative to purchase activity accounted for 87% of originations December 31, 2017 compared to 77% of total originations December 31, 2016. Origination volume relative to purchase activity accounted for 89% and 83% of total originations for the year ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Year to date origination volume increased approximately 5% to $2.5 billion during 2017. Gross margins on loans sold decreased approximately 3% during the quarter ended December 31, 2017, compared to the quarter ended December 31, 2016.\nAbout Waterstone Financial, Inc.\nWaterstone Financial, Inc.
