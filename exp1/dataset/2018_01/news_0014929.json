Last year’s output was boosted by the start of production at B2Gold’s giant Fekola project.\nFekola and Hummingbird Resources’ new Yanfolila mine are also expected to hit full production this year.\nIndustrial mining currently makes up only half of Mali’s gold output, the government estimates, with about 50 tonnes a year produced by artisinal miners.
