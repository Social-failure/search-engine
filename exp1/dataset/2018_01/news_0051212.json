You know what? I agree with him, although I think you'd be very lucky to get that kind of dip.\"\nNext, Chaikin turned to the daily chart of Cardinal Health, one of the top three pharmaceutical wholesalers.\nSince mid-December, when shares of Cardinal broke a nine-month losing streak, the stock has been soaring, breaking above its 200-day moving average in the beginning of January.\nThe Chaikin Money Flow has also been rising for over two months, suggesting that buying pressure is growing in Cardinal's stock.\nChaikin also called attention to Cardinal's moving average convergence divergence, or MACD, indicator, which can predict changes in a stock's trajectory before they occur.\nSince making a bullish crossover — depicted by the black line crossing above the red line in the chart above — the MACD indicator has been hitting new highs, confirming the market's revived love for the drugmaker.\n\"Cardinal has gone from a hated stock to a beloved stock in no time flat,\" Cramer said. \"Chaikin suggests buying the stock on a pullback below $73, down less than $3 from here, before the company reports earnings in a week and a half.\"\nFinally, Cramer and Chaikin tackled the daily chart of biotechnology giant Amgen, shares of which hit an all-time high on Monday.\nDespite the run, Chaikin felt less bullish about Amgen's trajectory, particularly considering the irregular and only slightly positive action in the Chaikin Money Flow.\n\"Unlike Centene or Cardinal, Chaikin doesn't see Amgen as being deluged by desperate buyers,\" Cramer added. \"Meanwhile, the stock is now nearly 20 points above its 50-day [moving average], and in the recent past, that short-term moving average has failed to act as a decent floor of support.\"\nCramer recalled Amgen's October volatility, when the stock fell to its 50-day moving average, failed to find a floor, and continued to slide until it found support at its 200-day moving average. In other words, shares of Amgen tend not to respond well to negative action.\nLooking ahead to Amgen's Thursday earnings report, Chaikin noted that the company's last three reports have triggered sell-offs in the stock, hurting shareholders.\n\"That's why Chaikin recommends ringing the register and taking some profits into Amgen's current strength,\" Cramer said. \"I can't blame him. Nobody ever got hurt taking a profit, and given how much Amgen's stock has run going into this quarter, the company needs to deliver a real upside surprise or else people will bail on the stock en masse.\"\nOverall, Cramer and Chaikin's analysis reaffirmed the health care cohort's positive action, but supported a strategy of looking at each stock in the group case by case.\n\"As much as the health care stocks have rallied here, the charts, as interpreted by Marc Chaikin, ... suggest that this group has been climbing thanks to major accumulation by big institutional money managers,\" Cramer said. \"In many cases, like Cardinal and Centene, he thinks it'll continue, although in some cases, like total popular fave Amgen, he thinks the stock's run too much. In general, though, Chaikin believes this bizarre, out-of-place rally in health care is poised to keep going, and I learned a long time ago not to be on the other side of a Chaikin trade.\"\nWATCH: Cramer and Chaikin diagnose health care stocks show chapters Cramer's charts forecast further gains for health care giants Centene and Cardinal Health 21 Hours Ago | 09:17 Questions for Cramer?\nCall Cramer: 1-800-743-CNBC\nWant to take a deep dive into Cramer's world?
