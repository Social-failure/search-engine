Refinery utilization rates fell by 2.1 percentage points to 90.9 percent of total capacity.\nGasoline stocks rose 3.1 million barrels, compared with analysts’ expectations in a Reuters poll for a 2.5 million-barrel gain.\nRelated Coverage U.S. East Coast crude stocks at lowest levels since Oct '14: EIA Distillate stockpiles, which include diesel and heating oil, rose by 639,000 barrels, versus expectations for a 1.5 million-barrel drop, the EIA data showed.\nNet U.S. crude imports fell last week by 71,000 bpd.\nReporting By David Gaffen; Editing by Marguerita Choy\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-01-24T23:40:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-25T13:16:44.002+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
