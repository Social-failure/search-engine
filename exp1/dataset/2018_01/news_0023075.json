British Airways denied him a boarding pass and turned him away. \nHawaii accused the airline of racial profiling in a video shared to his Twitter page. He claims that he could not afford the baggage fees and had been told by British Airways that he could board the flight if he wore the extra clothes, but was then rejected. British Airways, for its part, claimed that Hawaii had been rude and police were called to handle the situation, using pepper spray to subdue him. @British_Airways hi being held at Iceland Keflavik airport because I had no baggage put all the clothes on and they still won't let me on. Racial profiling? Or….. pic.twitter.com/NKgpe1cPFP \nRead: Booking a Holiday? These Travel Sites Let You Pay in Bitcoin \nHawaii’s trials and tribulations didn’t end there. He booked a new flight the following day on EasyJet, and, once again wearing several layers of clothing, was turned away. But the third time was a charm, and Hawaii reportedly made it back to London after boarding a Norwegian airline flight. \nAnd the cherry on the cake? Hawaii reportedly managed to get a refund from both British Airways and EasyJet after he complained.
