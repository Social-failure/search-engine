We plan on providing over 40 SKUs of various categories, over the next fiscal year, with the goal of making CBD Unlimited a recognizable brand for delivering the best CBD hemp oil and CBD infused products. In November 2017, we acquired Holistic Earth Remedies LLC, a therapeutic topical delivery systems company, to immediately capture 20% increase in revenues. This revenue producing acquisition has generated $85-90K annually in each of the past two years and will continue to add to our top line growth going forward. Heading into fiscal year 2018 we also expect to continue growing even more aggressively, through the quality of our relationships, networks, distributor and partners, and to build long-term shareholder value.”\nAbout Endexx\nEndexx, with its collaborative partners and consultants, develops and distributes two consumable product lines derived from industrial hemp, which is organic and naturally rich in phytocannabinoids.

The company also has two technology products and services that launched in 2014 -- the M3hub and the Autospense™.
