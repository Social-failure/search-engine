The finance ministry has already issued 10-year, 40-year and five-year JGBs totalling five trillion yen ($45.11 billion) over the past week and plans to sell 800 billion yen of 30-year bonds on Thursday.\n$1 = 110.8400 yen Reporting by the Tokyo markets team; Editing by Sherry Jacob-Phillips\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-01-17T13:58:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-18T16:29:03.012+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
