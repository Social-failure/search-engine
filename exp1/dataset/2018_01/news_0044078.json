The transfer operation cost 13.6 million Egyptian pounds (£538,125). \nSpeaking at a ceremony to mark the move, former antiquities minister Zahi Hawass underlined the importance of the museum project to Egypt’s tourism sector, which has been damaged in recent years by political violence. \n“It will tell people that Egypt is safe and you can come and visit us because we need the tourism for the preservation of the Egyptian antiquities.” People gather to watch the transfer of the Statue of King Ramses II to the Grand Egyptian Museum in Cairo, Egypt January 25, 2018. REUTERS/Mohamed Abd El Ghany \nAt its new location the statue will be the first thing visitors see as they enter the museum, part of which will open later this year ahead of its expected official launch in 2022. \nThe colossus was unearthed at the Mit Rahina archaeological site in 1820 by the Italian adventurer Giovanni Caviglia. Thursday’s move was the fourth it has seen over its several millennia of existence.

Increasing pollution and congestion at the square prompted its next move in 2006 to safekeeping in a storage area where it was kept of public view until now. \nEgypt’s tourism sector is one of the country’s main sources of foreign currency but it has struggled since a 2011 uprising that led to years of violent instability including a spate of Islamist militant attacks. \nThe sector saw an improvement in 2017, with revenues jumping 123.5 percent year-on-year to $7.6 billion and the number of tourists visiting rising 54 percent to 8.3 million. \nThe number of visitors in 2017, however, was still well below the 14.7 million who came in 2010 before the uprising.
