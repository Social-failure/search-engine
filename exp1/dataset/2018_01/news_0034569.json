( reut.rs/2rxQhrG ) \nRogers Media has transferred its studio interest in the venture to Vice Canada, while all content from the TV channel Viceland would be only available online, the company said. \nRogers’ move comes amid stiff competition from video-streaming services such as Netflix ( NFLX.O ) and Amazon Prime who are spending heavily to make original shows to draw viewers.
