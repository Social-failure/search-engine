It had declined to 91.751 on Tuesday, its lowest since Sept. 20.\nThe dollar bounced after Wednesday's strong U.S. manufacturing and construction data.\nIt gained further support as the minutes from the Fed's Dec. 12-13 meeting were more hawkish than anticipated, indicating the central bank is still poised to raise interest rates several times this year.\nFed policymakers acknowledged the U.S. labor market's solid gains and the expansion in economic activity, even as they affirmed worries about persistently low inflation.\nThat suggested the central bank will continue to pursue a gradual approach in raising rates but could hasten the pace if inflation accelerates.\n\"The dollar did feel downward pressure at the turn of the year, but the selling was not based on very strong factors,\" said Masafumi Yamamoto, chief currency strategist at Mizuho Securities in Tokyo.\nRebalancing of positions caused by investors closing their books towards the turn of each year can lead to dollar selling.\n\"As such, strong U.S. data and the Fed's minutes, which suggested board members were not as pessimistic towards the potential economic impact of U.S. tax cuts as many in the market expected, helped the dollar get back on course,\" Yamamoto said.\nshow chapters The US dollar is heading for a weaker year again in 2018 11:10 PM ET Tue, 2 Jan 2018 | 02:36 The euro was little changed at $1.2016 after losing roughly 0.4 percent overnight. The common currency had surged to a three-month high of $1.2081 on Tuesday against a broadly weaker dollar.\nThe U.S. currency was 0.15 percent higher at 112.655 yen. It touched a 2-1/2-week low of 112.055 on Tuesday after declining steadily from a high above 113.750, scaled in December.\nIncreasing investor risk appetite in broader markets also supported the dollar, notably against perceived safe-havens such as the yen and Swiss franc .\nThe latter was at 0.9778 franc per dollar after sliding 0.6 percent the previous day to pull back from a three-month peak of 0.9699.\nBuoyed by overnight gains on Wall Street, Tokyo's Nikkei began the first day of trading in 2018 by rallying 2.5 percent. Crude oil prices were at 2-1/2-year highs, helping fuel inflation expectations.\nMakoto Noji, senior strategist at SMBC Nikko Securities, expects dollar/yen to stay around 110 yen in the medium term.\n\"Yen demand stemming from Japan's current account surplus will be checked by yen selling pressure stemming from 'risk on' generated by global economic growth,\" he said. \"Dollar/yen is likely to remain in range around 110 yen amid this tug-of-war.\"\nThe pound was steady at $1.3515, following overnight losses of 0.6 percent, when it fell back from a 3-1/2-month high of $1.3614 against a rebounding dollar.\nThe Australian dollar was a shade lower at $0.7832 and the New Zealand dollar added 0.1 percent to $0.7098.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-04T04:15:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-04T05:19:08.001+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
