If he’s looking at it on the television, I don’t see how the referee could see it differently to the way we did.” \nJuventus coach Massimiliano Allegri said: “I haven’t had another look and I don’t want to comment. We could have scored the second goal before that.” \nJuventus, who rested forward Gonzalo Higuain and fielded Mandzukic as a lone striker, took the lead after 15 minutes when Douglas Costa volleyed home after the ball had ricocheted around the penalty area. \nTorino had their best chance of the match shortly afterwards as a long clearance by Vanja Milinkovic-Savic found M‘Baye Niang and the former AC Milan and Watford forward blasted his shot against the post. \nApart from that, Torino, beaten 4-0 by Juventus in the league earlier in the season, did not look like improving on a run which has seen them win only one of the last 25 meetings between the Turin neighbours. \nJuventus playmaker Paulo Dybala, scorer of two goals in the 3-1 Serie A win at Verona on Saturday, was again impressive, suggesting that he has left a poor spell of form behind him. \nJuventus will meet Atalanta in their two-leg semi-final while AC Milan meet Lazio in the other tie.
