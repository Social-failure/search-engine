The company has since struck additional deals to develop property projects.\nSources had told Reuters earlier this month that Instone was targeting a flotation on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange in March.\nDeutsche Bank ( DBKGn.DE ) and Credit Suisse ( CSGN.S ) are organizing the flotation with the help of Morgan Stanley ( MS.N ), BNP Paribas ( BNPP.PA ) and Unicredit ( CRDI.MI ).\nInstone was formed by a merger of Formart, part of German builder Hochtief ( HOTG.DE ), which specialist real estate investor Activum bought in 2014 for roughly 300 million euros, and peer GRK.\n($1 = 0.8167 euros)\nReporting by Hans Seidenstücker, Maria Sheahan and Arno Schuetze; Editing by Sherry Jacob-Phillips\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-22T08:52:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-22T09:30:31.021+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
