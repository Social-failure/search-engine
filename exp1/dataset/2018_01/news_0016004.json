At the time, BC Partners and Nordic Capital had vied to take control of the group. $1 = 0.8185 euros Reporting by Ludwig Burger; Editing by Douglas Busvine and Mark Potter", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-15T10:39:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-15T11:37:24.004+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
