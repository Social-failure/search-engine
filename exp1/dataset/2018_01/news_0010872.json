The S&P 500 has more than tripled since its 2009 low.\n“The current bull market was born on pessimism, grew on skepticism, and, after a huge run higher, is moving toward a general feeling of optimism,” said Scott Wren, senior global equity strategist at Wells Fargo & Co’s Investment Institute, in a note on Wednesday.\n“We do not believe the bull market is over. But we are closely watching, in addition to the fundamentals, investor sentiment. Because the eventual euphoria, which will come at some point, will likely be at the top.”\nFunds focused on equities outside the United States have largely been spared withdrawals, attracting cash every week last year while domestic-focused funds ended the year having posted outflows.\nBut in the latest week, inflows to world stock funds weakened to $1.1 billion, the lowest since last January, ICI said. The group’s data covers mutual funds and exchange-traded funds (ETFs) based in the United States.\nDemand for bonds remained strong despite a yield spike in December, and again this week, that pushed long-dated Treasuries’ prices down sharply.\nU.S.-based bond fund net inflows rose to $7.6 billion during the latest week, the largest in 10 weeks. The ICI data does not include fund inflows or withdrawals that occurred during the most recent long-bond sell-off.\nThe following table shows estimated ICI flows for mutual funds and ETFs (all figures in million of dollars):\n1/3 12/27 12/20 12/13 12/6/17\nEquity -21,009 4,099 -1,584 6,809 8,621\nDomestic -22,065 1,208 -9,550 5,347 5,962\nWorld 1,056 2,892 7,966 1,463 2,659\nHybrid -327 -940 -2,122 -1,415 -2,139\nBond 7,570 4,109 1,599 5,015 6,160\nTaxable 7,056 4,487 1,512 4,943 6,471\nMunicipal 515 -378 87 72 -311\nCommodity -305 -296 -434 5 421\nTotal -14,071 6,972 -2,541 10,414 13,064\nReporting by Trevor Hunnicutt; Editing by Tom Brown\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-10T21:02:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-10T21:23:43.014+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
