Begu sent a forehand wide in a see-sawing sixth game as Halep broke again and took the first set on serve.\nFourth seed Begu, seeking a first win over Halep at her sixth attempt, fought back to lead 3-2 in the second set but Halep eventually subdued the comeback attempt to seal victory.\n”It was a tough match,“ Halep said in a courtside interview. ”I know she is a strong player and in the second set you could see she was improving her game so it was a tougher battle.\n“I think I was strong enough to stay there and hit the ball stronger in the end because the energy (from Begu) was falling a little bit. I came back, I served pretty well in the last game and I‘m pretty proud of my victory today, it was a tough one.”\nReporting by Shrivathsa Sridhar in Bengaluru; Editing by Amlan Chakraborty and Ken Ferris\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-05T11:57:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-05T12:14:18.005+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
