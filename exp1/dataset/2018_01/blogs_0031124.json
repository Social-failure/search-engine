Nobody cared or resisted when the streaming giant raised the price of its 4K plan , which offers higher quality content, to $13.99 a month.\n\"Given that I pay $24 for two seats in a movie theater — $24 for a couple of maybe lousy hours of entertainment, pre-popcorn-and-candy, by the way — I'm thrilled to shell out a little more than just half that to binge on quality homegrown programming ... for a whole month,\" Cramer said.\nCustomers of Costco , which boasts some of the biggest bargains on the market, also tend to overlook when the big-box retailer raises the price of its membership cards, Cramer noted.\nApple's cloud service revenues also fall into this category. If privately-held music app Spotify ever comes public, its subscription-based service likely will, too, he said.\n\"The next time you get hit with a price increase and it doesn't bother you one bit, you need to pay up for the stock of that company in question, maybe even the next day,\" the \"Mad Money\" host concluded. \"In every instance I just mentioned ... it's been worth it.\"\nWATCH: Cramer on the right time to buy subscription stocks show chapters Cramer: This move by Amazon is a clarion call to buy the stock      21 Hours Ago | 05:45 Disclosure: Cramer's charitable trust owns shares of Apple. \nQuestions for Cramer?\nCall Cramer: 1-800-743-CNBC\nWant to take a deep dive into Cramer's world?
