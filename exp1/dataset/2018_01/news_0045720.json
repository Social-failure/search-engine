Analysts had expected revenue of $5.61 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.\nExcluding items, Baker Hughes earned 15 cents per share, beating analysts’ average estimate by 1 cent.\nShares sank nearly 5 percent to $34.05 in morning trading.\n“Early indications of customer capital spending in 2018 are encouraging,” Chief Executive Lorenzo Simonelli said in prepared remarks, adding that international activity was “stabilizing.”\nWall Street analysts broadly viewed the fourth-quarter results as a metric for the new company’s future performance.\nThis is “currently more about baselining the company’s operations than quarterly earnings prints vs. market expectations,” analysts from investment firm Tudor Pickering Holt wrote in a note on Wednesday, but added it was “good to see no huge surprises.”\nThe fate of the new company was thrown into question in November after General Electric said it was considering exiting the oilfield services business in an effort to refocus the conglomerate.\nUnder the merger agreement, such an exit could not occur until mid-2019 without special approval.\nOn Wednesday, Simonelli reiterated that Baker Hughes was on track to achieve the $700 million in synergies expected from the merger this year.\nHe said that under current commercial agreements, the company would still have access to certain General Electric technology and products despite a potential breakup.\nParent company General Electric on Wednesday posted a $10 billion fourth-quarter loss and 5-percent drop in revenue.\nRevenue from its Baker Hughes’ oilfield services business were $2.77 billion on a combined basis, up 10 percent. Gains in the segment come as the U.S. rig count is up about 35 percent in 2018. [RIG/U]\nMeanwhile, revenue in oilfield equipment fell 21 percent year-over-year, while those in its turbomachinery and process solutions business fell 14 percent amid a dearth of new LNG activity.\nThe company said it included a benefit of $132 million in its tax expenses as a result of U.S. tax reforms.\nOn a per-share basis, Baker Hughes posted a loss of 7 cents.\nReporting by Yashaswini Swamynathan in Bengaluru; Editing by Anil D'Silva and Bernadette Baum\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-24T13:57:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-24T14:23:17.006+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
