That means nothing is wrong, and people were overly focused on ‘Star Wars’,” Wedbush Securities analyst Michael Pachter said. \nThe gaming community was outraged over the company’s pricing of in-game purchases for the “Star Wars Battlefront II” game, with many complaining that the option gave unfair advantage to the well-heeled. \nEA has temporarily disabled micro-transactions following the backlash, which may have dented the popularity of the title. ( bit.ly/2EmJt2S ) \n“We sold fewer units than we thought in the quarter. We thought we would sell roughly eight million units, we sold just a little under one million units less than that,” Chief Financial Officer Blake Jorgensen told Reuters. \nThe company had indicated in the past that it expected the game to replicate the success of the previous version that sold over 14 million units in the fiscal year 2016. \n“We will continue to sell ‘Star Wars’ just at a slower pace than we originally thought,” Jorgensen said. \nOn an adjusted basis, revenue for the third quarter ended Dec. 31 was $1.97 billion. Analysts on average had expected $2.01 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. \nNet loss was $186 million, or 60 cents per share, in the quarter, compared with a loss of $1 million, or break even per share, a year earlier. The latest quarter included an income tax related charge of $176 million. \nSales at EA’s high-margin digital business rose nearly 14 percent to $780 million as more gamers bought their titles online instead of purchasing physical copies from retail stores.
