We remain positive as there’s no notable change in DRAM market dynamics,” said Lee Soon-hak, analyst at Hanwha Investment & Securities.\nSamsung Electronics shares closed at 2.554 million won on Thursday, a 11 percent drop from its all-time high of 2.876 million won in early November.\nThe stock fell sharply in late November after Morgan Stanley forecast that a down-cycle in NAND flash chips had started, ending a prolonged boom.\nHowever, analysts say the continued rise of DRAM chip prices in the fourth quarter has more than made up for that, and many are forecasting DRAM supply to remain tight throughout 2018 as companies expand data centers.\nAverage prices of server DRAM and mobile DRAM surged 45 percent and 20 percent respectively over 2017, with further gains expected in the first quarter, according to DRAMeXchange, part of research provider TrendForce.\nSamsung’s display business is seen reporting a quarterly profit of about 1.7 trillion won, up 27 percent from a year ago, on sales of organic light-emitting diode (OLED) screens for Apple Inc’s ( AAPL.O ) iPhone X smartphones as well as Samsung’s own handsets, according to analysts.\nThe company is expected to have sold a healthy 10 million Galaxy Note 8 phones since sales began in September, despite high-end segment competition with Apple, HMC Investment & Securities analyst Greg Roh said.\nEven so, the mobile business is expected to report profit similar to the previous corresponding quarter’s 2.5 trillion won, as marketing costs weighed.\nSouth Korean exporters are struggling with the stronger won KRW=KFTC which traded near a three-year high at 1,062.2 per dollar on Thursday.\nReporting by Joyce Lee; Additional reporting by Cynthia Kim; Editing by Stephen Coates\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-05T01:06:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-05T01:28:04.045+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
