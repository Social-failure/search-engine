Other people know about this and want to come see it,'” said Sam Rubaye, a 34-year-old property manager in Los Angeles who came up with friends. \nIn western North America, the eclipse began at 3:48 a.m. Pacific Time (1148 GMT), according to NASA. Those on the East Coast were less fortunate: the moon had set before the eclipse was in full swing, NASA said. \nThe eclipse occurred during the rare occasion of a   single month, otherwise known as a “blue moon,” and during a point in the moon’s orbit at which it has reached its closest position to Earth, thus making it appear larger and brighter in the sky than normal, as a “super moon.” A   sets during a partial lunar eclipse next to the Statue of Liberty as it is seen from Brooklyn, in New York, U.S., January 31, 2018. REUTERS/Eduardo Munoz \nThe reddish appearance of the lunar surface - the moon did not entirely disappear from view during the eclipse - was caused by rays of sunlight passing   as the moon fell into our planet’s shadow. \nCulinary student Monique Ramirez, 21, dragged three friends along for the drive, not disclosing their destination until the last minute.

So it was cool seeing it like that,” Ramirez said, as she lay under a blanket facing the moon. \nThe last time all three conditions occurred for a single lunar eclipse visible from North America was in 1866, according to the meteorological forecaster AccuWeather. \nJust before the moon emerged from a total eclipse, Griffith 0bservatory director Ed Krupp performed a rite intended to pay whimsical homage to myths about eclipses that date to ancient Babylon. Back then, some people believed they had to frighten away a mysterious creature swallowing the moon. \nIn a wizard’s garb complete with a pointed hat, Krupp marched through the crowd along with several assistants, chanting “dragon be gone.” Reporting by Alex Dobuzinskis;   Jonathan Allen; Editing by Scott Malone, Andrew Hay and Frances Kerry", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-31T10:15:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-31T10:39:37.049+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
