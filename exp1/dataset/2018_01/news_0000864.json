However, regulators have been tightening controls on the fast-growing 3.5 billion pound ($4.8 billion) spreadbetting industry. REGULATORY CHALLENGES \nShares in British spreadbetting firms sank last month after the European Securities   (ESMA) said it may curb core parts of their market under new powers from January. \nAdditionally, Britain’s markets watchdog said it had noticed steady growth in the volume of CFDs linked to digital currencies and would step up its scrutiny of the initial coin offering market or digital currency fund-raising, to see if new rules are needed to protect investors after issuing an alert in September. \nThe Financial Conduct Authority also said it supported the ESMA in its consideration of potential EU-wide product intervention. ( bit.ly/2yFVEn9 ) \nPlus500 said its “broad offering” allows customers to participate in the volatility of multiple crypto currencies, without owning the underlying asset. \n“Plus500 remains focused on risk management which includes setting appropriate risk and leverage for all the instruments traded on its platform,” it said. \nPlus500, whose rivals include CMC Markets ( CMCX.L ) and IG Group ( IGG.L ), is scheduled to report results for 2017 before the end of February.
