Tech experts said the bugs, named Spectre and Meltdown , were design flaws. \nMany Chinese companies have direct ties to the Chinese government, Walden said, which means the Chinese government may have known about the security vulnerabilities before the U.S. government or American companies — companies that may have been exposed to the security flaws. \n\"If they did [know] it's very troublesome,\" Waldon said. \"You wonder, of all the sectors that are out there, from energy to health care, who were kept in the dark about this,\" he said. \"When you tell [Chinese companies] you're running a risk, an obvious one, that you're telling the Chinese government.\" \n\"If a foreign government knew, did they do something? Or could they have exploited this?\" he said. \nWalden, who is also a chairman on the House, Energy and Commerce Committee, said Congress has asked top execs at Apple , Amazon , AMD , Google , Arm, Intel and Microsoft how long they knew about the flaws and why they choose to keep them a secret. \nCongress is just starting to hear back from some of the companies but has no definite answers yet, Walden said.
