Opponents of the new airport say it is too costly, bad for the environment and not needed because other airports in the wider region have spare capacity.\nIn his presentation, Huillard reiterated forecasts for higher 2017 revenue driven by a recovery in its contracting business and a solid performance of its motorways and airport concessions.\nHe also confirmed Vinci could increase its 8 percent stake in Aeroports de Paris (ADP) if the French state decides to privatise the airports operator or sell part of its stake. “ADP is an issue of interest to us but no one knows what the state will decide. We think there will be some action in 2018,” Huillard said.\nThe government has begun reducing its corporate holdings to finance a 10 billion euros fund for investment in innovation. While it has not revealed all the stakes which will be sold, sources expect ADP will be included.
