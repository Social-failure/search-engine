I‘m proud about that. It opens the road for other filmmakers and artists to think that there’s nothing impossible, especially in a time (when) your country is destroyed, your resources are less, and the people who could stand with you are less,” he said, speaking in English. \nSyria first submitted a film for Oscar consideration last year, to no avail. “Last Men in Aleppo” faces competition from “Abacus: Small Enough to Jail,”“Faces Places,”“Icarus,” and “Strong Island.” \nAnother film about the White Helmets, eponymously titled, won the Oscar for documentary short film in 2017.
