I never thought I would say this but I am glad that I have felt that this is my sport. I missed the competitions and training. It was a difficult period.”\nTrailing Zagitova by only 1.7 point, the 18-year-old Medvedeva is still in the running to secure a third consecutive European title following Saturday’s free skate.\nMedvedeva topped the podium at last year’s Grand Prix events in Moscow and Osaka but missed the Grand Prix Final because of a cracked bone in her right foot.\nThe injury also prevented her from competing at last month’s Russian national championships.\nItaly’s Carolina Kostner, a five-times European champion, finished third with 78.30 points despite a slight error on her triple toeloop.\n“I am very happy with my performance,” Kostner told a news conference. “I felt grounded and serene.” (Reporting by Gabrielle Tétrault-Farber, editing by Pritha Sarkar)\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-01-19T01:17:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-19T12:31:31.004+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
