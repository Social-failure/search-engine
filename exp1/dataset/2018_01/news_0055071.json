Shelters for missile launchers and other heavy equipment were erected several weeks ago and some may already be hidden from view inside, it said. \nU.S. officials said the State Department’s Diplomatic Security Service was helping South Korean authorities with security, a role it has undertaken at every Olympics since the 1976 Montreal games. \nRichard Colon, a Diplomatic Security official, said the service would have about 100 personnel in South Korea, working from the U.S. Embassy and the Olympics venues. They are assisting some 275 athletes and as many as 60,000 U.S. citizens. \nU.S. security officials said they were unaware of any specific threats and were confident the South Koreans would provide a secure Olympics. They noted Seoul hosted the 2014 Asian games and the 2002 FIFA world cup. \n“We’re only less than a hundred miles (160 km) from North Korea,” said Michael Evanoff, the assistant secretary for diplomatic security. “So we’ve planned for all contingencies.” Reporting by David Alexander; Editing by David Gregorio and James Dalgleish", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-31T23:29:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-31T23:49:13.038+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
