Patients who appear to have scoliosis with screening may have the diagnosis confirmed with x-rays or magnetic resonance imaging. \nEven though there aren’t any obvious harms or side effects from the screening itself, children might suffer psychological distress if they are inaccurately told they have scoliosis based on screening, and they might also suffer needless testing and treatment, the Task Force notes. \nLong-term studies also haven’t proven how much routine screening can help reduce the number of adults with scoliosis who suffer from breathing problems, back pain, disability or reduced quality of life, the Task Force points out. \nParents should still see a doctor if they’re concerned that their child might have scoliosis, said Dr. John Francis Sarwark, author of an accompanying editorial in JAMA and a researcher at the Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine and the Ann & Robert H. Lurie Children’s Hospital of Chicago. \n“Keep in mind that most children do not require treatment for normal findings, minor findings or mild scoliosis,” Sarwark advised.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-09T20:02:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-09T20:51:04.022+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
