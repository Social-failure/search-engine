Sisi was elected in 2014 and is expected to seek a second term in a March vote this year. \nAuthorities broke up the two sit-ins - at al-Nahda and Rabaa squares - in August 2013, killing hundreds of protesters. Protests were banned shortly after the two pro-Mursi camps were dispersed and scores were arrested. \nHundreds of Mursi sympathizers have been detained and prosecuted since his ousting. Egypt has banned the Muslim Brotherhood, deeming it a terrorist organization. \nThe government accuses the Brotherhood of fomenting an Islamist insurgency since Mursiâ€™s removal. Militant attacks have killed hundreds of Egyptians, mostly soldiers and police. \nSecurity forces have killed hundreds and detained thousands of members of the group, which says it is committed to political change through peaceful means only. \nThe court also ordered on Tuesday that those sentenced be fined a total of nearly 40 million Egyptian pounds ($2.27 million) for damaging public property.
