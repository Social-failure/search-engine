REUTERS/Stefan Wermuth Matthias Mayer, gold medalist in Sochi four years ago, was third, 0.67 seconds behind Feuz.\nSvindal, back in form after having knee surgery a year ago, led Feuz’s time on the upper part of the course, then trailed, then led by 0.02 seconds at the final split time but lost crucial seconds near the end.\nSlideshow (3 Images) His time was greeted with cheers by the 35,000 crowd that packed the car-free resort, which can only be reached by railway, since after that Feuz never looked threatened.\n“When you go first, you don’t really know where you stand but once Aksel had gone, I knew I was in with a real chance,” Feuz told reporters after the ninth World Cup win of his career.\n“I feel good, I feel fit and I think I‘m skiing very well this season.”\nThe Swiss also won the Wengen downhill in 2012 and was second three years ago. Svindal stayed top of the World Cup downhill standings with 420 points but Feuz cut his lead to 58.\nWriting by Brian Homewood; Editing by Ken Ferris\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-13T16:23:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-13T16:32:24.083+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
