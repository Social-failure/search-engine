We are committed to attracting and retaining talent in all aspects of what we do and are thrilled to welcome Richard, Ahmad and Andrew to Sotheby's.\"\nJennifer Deason, Sotheby's Head of Strategy & Corporate Development, continued, \"The acquisition of Thread Genius and the addition of Richard, Ahmad and Andrew to the Sotheby's team advance a number of initiatives related to the strategic capture and use of data to improve internal processes and provide a wider range of services to clients. We have united all of our data-related activities under one umbrella, which will accelerate innovation and provide benefits to both our internal team and our clients.\"\nThe acquisition of Thread Genius builds on Sotheby's 2016 acquisition of the Mei Moses Art Indices – now known as Sotheby's Mei Moses – a database of nearly 50,000 repeat auction sales in eight collecting categories. Sotheby's Mei Moses also provides the foundation for an object database currently under development. These efforts will allow Sotheby's to be more nimble in connecting buyers and sellers, increasing the volume of opportunities for collectors at all price points.\nAndrew Shum and Ahmad Qamar were the co-founders, CEO and CTO of Thread Genius, respectively.
