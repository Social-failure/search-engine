The second profit alert led to the departure of chief executive-designate Kevin Cummings, meaning GKN was without a permanent CEO until Anne Stevens was appointed last week. \nElliott has been an investor in GKN “for a while” and believes the engineering group has underperformed its rivals, the person familiar with the situation said. \nThe U.S. fund also disclosed on Monday a 0.5 percent short position in Melrose shares via CfDs, which the person said was for hedging purposes. \nSpokesmen for Elliott and GKN declined to comment. \nElliott, which has an office in London’s upmarket Mayfair district, has become increasingly active in Britain. \nIt was among investment firms that forced Belgium-based brewer Anheuser-Busch InBev to raise its offer for rival beer business SABMiller in 2016, a $110 billion deal that was the UK’s biggest corporate takeover. \nThe hedge fund disclosed its GKN stake on the same day that London-listed Melrose signalled its determination to push on with its takeover plan. \nThe turnaround specialist said on Monday that it had started to meet with GKN investors to discuss its bid, ramping up the pressure on the company. \n“We are aiming to put into sharp focus the options for GKN shareholders,” Melrose CEO Simon Peckham said in a statement. \nGKN shares closed up 4.1 percent at 437.4 pence and Melrose stock finished 1.4 percent higher at 230.6 pence. \nShares in GKN have soared by 31.5 percent since it disclosed Melrose’s approach.
