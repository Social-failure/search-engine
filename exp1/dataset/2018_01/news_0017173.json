The Aga Khan is the title held by the leader of the Ismaili branch of Shi‘ite Islam.\nWhile the finding has resonated with some, including a woman who asked him on Tuesday how it felt to be the first prime minister found guilty of a crime, most of the questions lobbed at Trudeau at the town halls have been fawning, and even his calm response to hecklers wins praise.\n“It is his show, his sweet spot, and it must gall the opposition that he is still treated like a celebrity in those settings,” a Toronto Star columnist wrote, noting the difficulty Conservative opposition leader Andrew Scheer has getting such positive attention.\nWith three town halls still to go, the opposition party has taken to social media to object to Trudeau’s at times light-hearted tone with attendees.\n“Justin Trudeau is the first Canadian prime minister to break a federal law while in office. Then he refused to appear at the Ethics Committee to explain himself. Now, he is laughing about it. How does that make you feel?” the Conservative Party tweeted on Thursday.\nThe Conservatives say they plan to keep the ethics violations front and center when the House of Commons returns Jan. 29.\nTrudeau’s approval rating still hovers around 50 percent, according to Ipsos, levels similar to when he took office, despite a 2017 backlash from small businesses over tax changes and opposition accusations that Trudeau and his multi-millionaire Finance Minister Bill Morneau are out-of-touch elites.\nReporting by Andrea Hopkins; Editing by Richard Chang\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-01-13T03:18:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-13T14:50:37.021+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
