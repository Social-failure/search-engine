The dollar also dropped against most currencies and gold rose. U.S. equities declined. \n\"I think the Chinese will contribute to the removal of liquidity from the U.S. bond market,\" said Michael Shaoul, chairman and CEO of Marketfield Asset Management. \"That's not helpful to a bond market that's already under pressure.\" \nA taper in Chinese purchases would come as the Federal Reserve unwinds the massive balance sheet it amassed after the financial crisis. The Fed is also expected to raise rates three times this year. In 2017, the central bank also hiked rates three times. \nThe U.S. 10-year yield rose to 2.56 percent on Wednesday, hitting levels not seen since last March. The dollar also fell against a basket of major currencies, trading down 0.3 percent at 92.28.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-10T15:19:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-10T15:22:05.004+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
