A petition calling for his dismissal gathered more than 220,000 signatures. \nIn 2012, he criticized the “ghastly” need for schools to meet accessibility requirements for the disabled. He has also said women who “display a lot of cleavage shouldn’t then complain when men notice them”, described himself as a self-confessed pornography addict, and joked about being sexually aroused by images of hungry African children. \nHe has apologized for such comments, which he said dated to a career as a “journalistic provocateur” and did not reflect his commitment to education. \n“My appointment has become a distraction from (the Office for Students’) vital work of broadening access to higher education and defending academic freedom,” Young said in a statement on the website of the Spectator magazine. \nRobert Halfon, the Conservative chairman of parliament’s education committee, told BBC radio on Tuesday that Young’s appointment had been a mistake. His appointment “hadn’t possibly been considered with due diligence and I thought it was the wrong decision”, Halfon said. \nOn Sunday, May said Young should be allowed to continue serving even though she condemned offensive comments he had made in the past. But the issue had damaged her attempts to rebrand her Conservative party as more inclusive during the ministerial reshuffle, which began on Monday and is aimed at promoting more women, black and younger lawmakers. \nThe reshuffle was triggered by the resignation of May’s top ally in the cabinet, Damian Green, who was forced to quit after giving misleading statements about pornography on his laptop. \nMay, who lost her majority in parliament last year after calling a snap election that she expected to win in a landslide, has struggled to restore her authority over a party divided between supporters and opponents of a hard break with the EU.
