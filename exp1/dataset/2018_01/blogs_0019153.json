The President has since said that he did not use the profanity in his description, though concede that \"the language used by me at the DACA meeting was tough.\" \nTweet. \nThis isn't the first time the Goldman chief has taken to Twitter to scold the president on immigration issues. Blankfein jabbed the president in September, saying that \"immigration is a complex issue but I wouldn't deport a kid who was brought here and only knows America.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-12T22:55:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-12T23:23:20.003+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
