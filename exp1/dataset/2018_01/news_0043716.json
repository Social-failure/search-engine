There will also be some uncertainty as to the effects on our business of the FIFA World Cup,” Chairman Tim Martin said in the statement. \nWetherspoon, like other operators in the sector, has been battling rising costs due to the government’s National Living Wage initiative, higher property prices and unfavourable currency exchange rate. \nJD Wetherspoon’s performance contrasts to that of Marston’s ( MARS.L ), which on Tuesday said business in the Christmas period was marred by snowy and icy weather. \nWetherspoon, which opened three new pubs since the start of the financial year and sold 10, said it intended to open 10 pubs in the current financial year.
