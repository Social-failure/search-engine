On Tuesday, the dollar fell 0.39 percent against the yen.\n“All of last year there was this fantastic correlation between U.S. 10-year yields and dollar-yen and people put on what is known as pairs trades,” said Greg Anderson, global head of FX strategy at BMO Capital Markets in New York.\n“But that correlation has broken apart fantastically over the last couple of days. All those people that would have had that trade on are stopped out,” he said.\nThe dollar rose against its Canadian counterpart and CAD= and Mexico's peso MXN= after a Reuters report said Canada increasingly believes that U.S. President Donald Trump will soon announce his intention to withdraw from the North American Free Trade Agreement treaty.\nThe greenback was 0.65 percent higher against the loonie and up 0.47 percent against the Mexican peso.\nSterling edged lower against the dollar, as investors locked in profits after a rally and showed reluctance to push it any higher until major new catalysts emerged.\nReporting by Saqib Iqbal Ahmed; Editing by Susan Thomas and Richard Chang\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-01-10T09:05:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-11T00:19:23.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
