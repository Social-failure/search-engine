Croatia said it wanted to buy back INA’s shares from MOL which MOL accepted but said the price must be adequate.\nThe future of the Sisak refinery was one of the bones of contention between the two shareholders as Zagreb primarily focused on saving jobs rather than profitability. A recent study by Deloitte proposed converting the refinery into a logistics centre and a facility to refine biomass.\nThe Croatian government is in the process of choosing an adviser for buying back INA shares from MOL and for potentially seeking another strategic partner.
