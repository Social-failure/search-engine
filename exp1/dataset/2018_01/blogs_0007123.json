Such companies also would not be allowed in the exchange’s indexes, and if they already trade on the exchange they would be delisted.\nThe ban would not apply to companies with equity of more than 100 million shekels ($29 million) and with three years of audited financial statements.\nThe amendment has been approved by the ISA board and next goes for public comment.\nThe proposal for the amendment came after a sharp rise in shares of Blockchain Mining ( BLCM.TA ), a company that said it would shift its focus from mining for gold and iron to mining crypto currencies.\n“This phenomenon, if it continues, may in the future have serious consequences on the ... fairness of trading in the bourse in general and on investor confidence in the bourse,” the ISA said.\nShare prices of companies intending to operate in the sector are cut off from their real value, the ISA said, and “the market treats their shares irrationally and unexpectedly.”\nLast month, outgoing ISA chairman Shmuel Hauser said he planned to bring such a proposal up, saying bitcoin prices were behaving like a bubble.\nThe value of a bitcoin, the biggest and best-known cryptocurrency, surged in mid-December to nearly $20,000, then dropped to less than $12,000 at the end of the month. It was trading today around $14,500.\nBitcoin is a publicly available ledger of a finite number of digital “coins”, which backers say can be used as a currency without the support of any country’s central bank. It is “mined” by computers, which are awarded new coins for working out complex mathematical formulas. Several other cryptocurrencies have also been launched that work on similar principles.\n($1 = 3.4453 shekels)\nReporting by Steven Scheer, editing by Larry King\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-04T16:49:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-04T16:54:32.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
