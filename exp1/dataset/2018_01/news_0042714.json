Notes:\n1 We define Adjusted EBITDA as net income attributable to Comcast Corporation before net (income) loss attributable to noncontrolling interests and redeemable subsidiary preferred stock, income tax benefit (expense), other income (expense) items, net, depreciation and amortization expense, and other operating gains, and excluding impairment charges related to fixed and intangible assets and gains or losses on the sale of long-lived assets, if any. From time to time we may exclude from Adjusted EBITDA the impact of events, gains, losses or other charges (such as significant legal settlements) that affect the period-to-period comparability of our operating performance. See Table 4 for reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures. 2 All earnings per share amounts are presented on a diluted basis and reflect the two-for-one stock split on February 17, 2017. 3 We define Free Cash Flow as Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities (as stated in our Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows) reduced by capital expenditures, cash paid for intangible assets, principal payments on capital leases and cash distributions to noncontrolling interests; and adjusted for any payments and receipts related to certain nonoperating items, net of estimated tax effects. The definition of Free Cash Flow excludes any impact from Economic Stimulus packages. These amounts have been excluded from Free Cash Flow to provide an appropriate comparison. See Table 5 for reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures. 4 To be consistent with our current management reporting presentation, certain 2016 operating results were reclassified within the Cable Communications segment.

Our definition of free cash flow specifically excludes any impact from the Economic Stimulus Packages and these amounts are presented separately. Net cash provided by operating activities in the fourth quarter 2017 includes a $250 million payment related to a legal settlement. Net cash provided by operating activities for 2016 includes a $146 million payment for the settlement of a tax receivable agreement related to the DreamWorks acquisition. For free cash flow purposes, we consider these payments to be nonrecurring in nature and therefore, we excluded these amounts from free cash flow as nonoperating items. (2) In first quarter 2017, we adopted new accounting guidance related to share-based compensation. The guidance requires excess tax benefits under share-based compensation arrangements to be classified as an operating activity rather than a financing activity as required under prior guidance. In addition, the new guidance requires when an employer withholds shares upon exercise of options or the vesting of restricted stock for the purpose of meeting withholding tax requirements, that the cash paid for withholding taxes be classified as a financing activity, which we present in repurchases of common stock under repurchase program and employee plans. We previously recorded cash paid for withholding taxes as an operating activity in changes in operating assets and liabilities. These changes will prospectively affect our calculation of Free Cash Flow. While we have retrospectively adopted these changes in our Statement of Cash Flows and the components of Free Cash Flow, we have not adjusted Total Free Cash Flow for periods prior to January 1, 2017. The table below summarizes the impact to the components of Free Cash Flow for the share-based compensation accounting change.\nThree Months Ended\nDecember 31,\nTwelve Months Ended\nDecember 31,\n2016\n2016\nCash taxes on operating items (including Economic Stimulus Packages) $40 $233 Changes in operating assets and liabilities 53 352 Impact of share-based compensation accounting change $93 $585 (3) Cash taxes on operating items (including Economic Stimulus Packages) has been adjusted to exclude the impact of nonoperating items, such as for cash taxes paid related to certain investing and financing transactions. Our definition of free cash flow specifically excludes any impact from the Economic Stimulus Packages and these amounts are presented separately.\nThree Months Ended\nDecember 31, Twelve Months Ended\nDecember 31, 2016 2017 2016 2017 Payments of income taxes ($977 ) ($642 ) ($3,693 ) ($4,057 ) Nonoperating items 50 (152 ) 96 (13 ) Cash taxes on operating items (including Economic Stimulus Packages) ($927 ) ($794 ) ($3,597 ) ($4,070 ) (4) Net cash provided by operating activities for 2016 includes a $146 million decrease in the third quarter resulting from a payment for the settlement of a tax receivable agreement immediately after the DreamWorks acquisition. Net cash provided by operating activities in the fourth quarter 2017 includes a $250 million payment related to a legal settlement. For free cash flow purposes, we consider these settlement payments to be nonrecurring in nature and therefore we excluded these amounts from free cash flow. Because these amounts have no impact on free cash flow, they are not included in the changes in operating assets and liabilities for this presentation. 2017 year to date changes in operating assets and liabilities for this presentation also excludes an increase of $250 million for a legal settlement, as this is not included in Adjusted EBITDA. Note: Minor differences may exist due to rounding.
