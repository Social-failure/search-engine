He is the senior Democrat on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. \nCardin was easily re-elected in 2012, beating his Republican challenger by 30 points in the heavily-Democratic state. \nManning had been working as an intelligence analyst in Iraq. She was convicted by court-martial in 2013 of espionage and other offenses for furnishing more than 700,000 documents, videos and diplomatic cables to WikiLeaks, an international organization that publishes information from anonymous sources. \nShe came out as transgendered shortly after her sentencing, but the military denied her request for hormone therapy treatment while behind bars. She was placed in solitary confinement after attempting suicide twice.
