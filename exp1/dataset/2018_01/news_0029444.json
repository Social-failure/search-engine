The hearing was called to question current and former officials about the island’s accounting practices.\n644 ACCOUNTS Panelist Gerardo Portela, director of the Puerto Rican financial authority known as AAFAF, stressed the severity of Puerto Rico’s liquidity crisis, noting that $4.3 billion of the found money is tied up at government agencies and unavailable to pay the island’s debt.\nPortela’s comment illustrates ongoing tension between authorities concerned that Puerto Rico is overstating its financial plight, and locals who feel ignored by those authorities.\nBoard member Jose Gonzalez questioned Portela on whether, during a financial crisis, it was fair to deem certain accounts off-limits to creditors, particularly those whose revenues are generated through government actions like tax streams.\nA panel of ex-officials, which included former Puerto Rico Treasury Secretary Juan Zaragoza Gomez, revealed a history of inefficient accounting in an unwieldy, decentralized government.\nAgencies do not communicate well, he said, because of constant political turnover, and also because they use different computing software. “We’d be using Oracle 2.0 at Treasury, and Oracle 2.3 at the Department of Health, and Oracle 1.7 at Education,” he said.\nIn April of 2016, Zaragoza said, when he was closing accounts at the island’s then-liquidating Government Development Bank (GDB), “I honestly thought we had like 30 or 40 bank accounts.”\nIn fact, “we had 644 accounts at GDB,” Zaragoza said.\nReporting By Nick Brown; Editing by Daniel Bases and Richard Chang\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-01-20T01:56:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-20T17:46:24.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
