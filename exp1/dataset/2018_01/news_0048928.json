Against the euro, it was 0.2 percent weaker at 87.95 pence .\n“The pound has softened due to heightened speculation that Theresa May could face a leadership challenge,” said MUFG currency analyst Lee Hardman\n“Political uncertainty would be an unwelcome development as the Brexit talks enter a more crucial phase, (and) poses a potential banana skin for the pound after recent gains,” he added.\nHaving reached its highest level since late June 2016 last week, sterling’s trade-weighted index slipped to a six-day low .\nOne-month sterling risk reversals, which indicate how investors are positioned towards the currency during that period, slipped to their lowest in twelve days, having hit their highest since 2012 last week.\nBut many investors are still upbeat about the pound. Data last week showed Britain’s economy unexpectedly picked up speed in the last three months of 2017, adding to the view that the hit from the Brexit vote in June 2016 was not as bad as some had expected.\n“Sterling embodies a range of potential outcomes for Brexit. That includes the risk of a hard Brexit,” wrote Berenberg UK economist Kallum Pickering in a note to clients.\n“If the UK avoids this risk sterling is probably undervalued on real trade-weighted basis by between 5 percent and 10 percent.” (Reporting by Jemima Kelly; Editing by Toby Chopra)\n ", "external_links": ["http://tmsnrt.rs/2egbfVh", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "http://tmsnrt.rs/2hwV9Hv"], "published": "2018-01-29T18:41:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-30T19:06:24.024+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
