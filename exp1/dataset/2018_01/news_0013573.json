The reform also introduced an annual cap of $10,000 on deduction of state and local tax. \nLennar on Wednesday forecast its fiscal 2018 home deliveries to rise 8.9-10.6 percent and said gross margins for the full year will be in line with last year’s levels at 22 percent after having fallen for three years. LOWER Q4 PROFIT \nThe company’s shares fell in morning trading after reporting a lower-than-expected fourth-quarter profit, citing a transaction that got pushed to the first quarter. \nLennar did not disclose further details on the transaction, but the No. 2 U.S. homebuilder said it would more than make up for the shortfall in the first quarter. \nThe company’s orders rose 11.5 percent, with buyers signing up for 7,357 homes in the quarter ended Nov. 30. \nLennar’s orders have climbed for seven straight years as the U.S. housing market recovered from the sub-prime crash of 2007-2008. \nThe homebuilder, which agreed to buy smaller rival CalAtlantic Group Inc ( CAA.N ) for $5.7 billion in October, said the deal was expected to close on Feb. 12. \nThe CalAtlantic deal would give it more tools to deal with higher labor and land costs. \nLennar’s total revenue rose 12.1 percent to $3.79 billion topping the analysts’ estimate of $3.57 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. \nNet income attributable to Lennar fell 1.2 percent to $309.6 million, or $1.29 per share, missing the average estimate of $1.48 per share.
