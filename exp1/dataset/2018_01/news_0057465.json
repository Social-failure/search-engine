It is also expected to include euro tranches, they added.\nA US$13bn financing would give leverage of around 7.5 times, based on last 12 months Ebitda of approximately US$1.7bn for the F&R unit. Senior leverage of roughly 4.5-5.0 times could give a loan of US$8bn-$9bn, and junior debt of US$4bn-$5bn, sources said.\nAnother source familiar with the matter said that leverage was expected to be below 6.0 times.\nAlthough the size of the financing is challenging, liquid banks and investors are eager to lend to new buyouts as the strong level of global demand continues to exceed supply.\n“The market capacity for Europe is about €5bn between loans and bonds and in the US is US$10bn-$15bn, so if there is a big deal that pushes capacity and the business has revenue globally it would make sense to have euro and dollars in loans and bonds to create a competitive dynamic in order to get best execution.”\nThomson Reuters and Blackstone declined to comment.\nThomson Reuters’ board is expected to meet on Tuesday to discuss Blackstone’s offer for the F&R business, which supplies news, data and analytics to banks and investment houses around the world. The unit contributes more than half of Thomson Reuters’ annual revenues.\nUnder the terms of the Blackstone offer, Thomson Reuters would retain a 45% stake in the F&R business in partnership with the US buyout firm.\nAdditional reporting by Davide Scigliuzzo in New York; Editing by Christopher Mangham and Tessa Walsh\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-01-30T23:18:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-31T16:09:57.010+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
