Other firms drilling in the West African country include UK’s Tullow oil and Kosmos Energy. \nThe Exxon Mobil deal is the first to be signed after the International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea last September drew an ocean boundary favoring Ghana in a dispute with its neighbor Ivory Coast. \nExxon Mobil, lead operator, holds an 80-percent interest in the DWCTP, while state-run Ghana National Petroleum Corporation holds 15 percent. Exxon is yet to select a local partner to own the remaining 5 percent as Ghana’s laws required, Energy Minister Boakye Agyarko told Reuters. \nThe agreement is subject to approval by parliament and Exxon is expected to start exploration this year, Agyarko said.
