Last year, SGX kicked off a public consultation on dual-class shares.\n\"Singapore is making huge efforts to transition into the new economy and we are already recognised as the leading hub for start-ups,\" SGX CEO Loh Boon Chye said after the bourse reported its quarterly results on Friday. \"Some of these companies may need a capital structure that supports a rapid scaling up of their business,\" he said referring to dual class shares.\n\"The DCS is one way, not the only way. We expect to have our rules out end of this quarter and expect our first listing thereafter,\" Loh.\nDual-class shares typically give one set of shareholders greater voting rights than others. The structure is popular by owners of new technology companies, with the extra voting power given to top executives seen as protection against pressure for short-term returns.\nBut dual-class shares have also been criticised by corporate governance activists, who have warned that the structure could be abused by company insiders.\nHong Kong is also set to allow dual-class shares under rule changes to be proposed by Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing (HKEX), the city's exchange operator which is raising the stakes in a battle against New York for blockbuster Chinese initial public offerings.\nEarlier on Friday, SGX said it expected increased market activity and more listings after reporting a flat net profit for October-December.
