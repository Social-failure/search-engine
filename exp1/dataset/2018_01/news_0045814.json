[nL1N1NY2OB]\nEnergy data provider Genscape said on Thursday the pipeline flow averaged an estimated 524,000 bpd last week.\nThe reduced flows have contributed to inventory declines at the Cushing, Oklahoma storage hub and pressured Canadian crude differentials, traders said.\nPHMSA did not immediately comment on when the line would be allowed to return to full capacity.\nReporting by Devika Krishna Kumar in New York; Editing by Marguerita Choy\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-01-24T02:49:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-24T08:20:17.030+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
