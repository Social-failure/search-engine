REUTERS/Kim Kyung-Hoon \nThat’s slightly below the five-year average of just over 420 million barrels. \nU.S. production fell 290,000 barrels per day to 9.5 million bpd, the EIA said, foiling expectations of U.S. output breaking through 10 million bpd. AMPLE FUEL \nDespite this, more bearish signals are appearing. Fuel inventories in Asia and the United States remain ample, and in some cases are rising. \nU.S. gasoline stocks rose 4.1 million barrels, EIA data showed, more than expected. \nIn Asia’s oil trading hub Singapore, average refinery profit margins have fallen below $6 per barrel this month, their lowest seasonal level in five years, resulting in lower feedstock crude orders. \nWith the crude price up by more than 13 percent since early December, some analysts expect a downward price correction following the recent bull-run. \n“Markets are getting a bit fatigued, and a healthy correction could be on the cards,” said Stephen Innes, head of trading for Asia/Pacific at futures brokerage Oanda in Singapore.
