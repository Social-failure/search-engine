Clint Capela had 17 points and 16 rebounds for his 21st season double-double for the Rockets, who improved to 5-2 without NBA leading scorer James Harden.\nGuard Devin Booker had 27 points and nine assists and TJ Warren had 21 points for the Suns, who had won four of seven since Booker returned from injury.\nThe Rockets made 15 of 47 3-point attempts (31.9 percent), extending to 37 their NBA record for consecutive games of at least 10 threes.\nAnderson and Ariza had four 3-pointers apiece, and Paul, P.J. Tucker and Eric Gordon had two apiece. Gordon, who has started in Harden’s absence, scored 14 points but made just 5 of 19 shots from the floor.\nHouston had a 53-38 rebounding edge.\nRockets reserves Gerald Green had 12 points and Tucker had six points and nine rebounds. Both are former Suns.\nDragan Bender finished with 14 points and eight rebounds, and Tyson Chandler grabbed 11 rebounds for Phoenix.\nBender, Booker and Tyler Ulis made 3-pointers as the Suns broke to a 21-10 lead, but the Rockets turned it around with a 37-8 run capped by Anderson’s two free throws for a 47-29 lead with 5:13 remaining in the first half.\nHarden has missed the past seven games with a Grade 2 left hamstring strain. He has not played since scoring 40 in a 148-142 victory over the Los Angeles Lakers on New Year’s Eve.\nThe Suns played without starting forward Marquese Chriss (hip flexor) and reserves Josh Jackson (hip) and Isaiah Canaan (adductor). Jackson had his first career double-double with 17 points and a season-high 10 rebounds in the Suns’ previous game, a 114-100 victory over the Oklahoma City Thunder on Sunday.\nHouston power forward Nene missed his fifth consecutive game with a knee injury, and center Tarik Black was held out after sustaining an eye abrasion Wednesday against the Portland Trail Blazers.\n--Field Level Media\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-01-13T14:15:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-14T20:27:49.009+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
