The administration also raised its estimate for January production to 6.44 million barrels a day.\nKeeping with the trend, the Permian Basin in Texas and New Mexico will account for most of the gains. EIA sees Permian drillers increasing their output by 76,000 barrels a day.\nAnother Texas shale oil region, the Eagle Ford, is expected to chip in growth of 15,000 barrels a day.\nProduction from North Dakota's Bakken shale is set to grow by 8,000 barrels a day, while output from the Niobrara shale underlying Colorado and neighboring states will rise by 6,000 barrels a day, EIA says.\nDrillers in these regions squeeze oil and gas from shale by pumping water, sand and chemicals underground to fracture rock formations, a process called hydraulic fracturing. Shale drilling is driving the recovery in U.S. oil production following a prolonged slump in oil prices.\nLast week, EIA forecast that total U.S. oil output will hit 10.3 million barrels a day , the highest annual average on record. The following year, EIA expects American production to average 10.8 million barrels a day, putting it roughly on par with Saudi Arabia and Russia's output.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-16T22:35:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-16T22:36:59.002+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
