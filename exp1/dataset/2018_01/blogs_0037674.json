The protective taxes will dissipate over three years. \nThe president also introduced tariffs on imported solar panels.\nThe impending price increases were largely expected across Wall Street, with Goldman Sachs predicting that the protectionist policy could send the cost of a new washing machine 8 percent to 20 percent higher. The tariff also includes a tax on machine parts, which could drive some costs higher for domestic manufacturers as well.\nThe Wall Street Journal, which first reported the memo, said that industry experts predict that LG will raise retail prices on some of its models by roughly $50.\n\"We are very disappointed in this misguided decision, which far exceeds what the expert agency recommended,\" said LG on Tuesday. \"This is a textbook case about how certain companies can game the process to use trade laws to try to accomplish what they can't accomplish in the marketplace.\"\nThe move is being praised by U.S.-based appliance manufacturer Whirlpool , which has long lobbied for more protective measures against its Asian rivals.\n\"This is a victory for American workers and consumers alike,\" Whirlpool Chairman Jeff Fettig said in a press release Monday. \"This announcement caps nearly a decade of litigation and will result in new manufacturing jobs.\"\nShares of Whirlpool were up 3.6 percent Wednesday, adding to a week-to-date gain of more than 6 percent.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-24T22:49:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-24T23:09:41.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
