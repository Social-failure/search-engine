The trade commission was tasked with determining whether Boeing was or could be harmed by Bombardier.\nThe decision had escalated the bitter trade dispute between the two aircraft manufacturers. It has also added to tensions between the U.S. and Canada, as the Trump administration seeks to renegotiate terms in the North American Free Trade Agreement, or NAFTA.\nThis is a breaking news story, please check back for updates.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-26T21:31:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-26T21:38:09.044+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
