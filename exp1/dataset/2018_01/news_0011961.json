REUTERS/Paulo Whitaker/File Photo The 2016-2017 level was down from an average 6,847 square kilometers in the 6 years to the beginning of the moratorium in 2008. The 2016-2017 level represented 1.5 percent of overall Amazon deforestation for the period.\n“It’s peanuts,” Paulo Adario, senior strategist for forests for environmental group Greenpeace, said of the soy growth compared with overall Amazon deforestation.\nFILE PHOTO: An aerial view shows the Amazon rainforest (top) bordered by land cleared to prepare for the planting of soybeans, in Mato Grosso state, western Brazil, October 2, 2015.
