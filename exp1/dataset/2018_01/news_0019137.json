The year ended with a benefit from the new tax legislation, giving us increased flexibility as we continue to invest in our businesses, communities and our employees, which helps drive our Main Street banking model. We executed on our strategic priorities throughout the year, including our technology initiatives and the expansion of our middle market franchise into new markets. As we enter the new year, we believe we are firmly positioned to create long-term value for our shareholders.\"\nPNC's fourth quarter and full year 2017 reported net income and earnings per share benefited from the new federal tax legislation net of significant items, as summarized in the following table.\nSummary Impact of Tax Legislation and Significant Items\nIn millions, except per share data\nDiluted Earnings Per Common Share\nImpact on\nNet Income\nEPS Impact of\nTax Legislation &\nSignificant Items\nReported\nEPS (GAAP)\nEPS Excluding Impact\nof Tax Legislation &\nSignificant Items\n(non-GAAP)\nTax legislation\n$\n1,129\n$\n2.35\nSignificant items, net\n(218)\n$\n(0.46)\n4Q17 impact\n$\n911\n$\n1.89\n$\n4.18\n$\n2.29\n2017 full year impact\n$\n911\n$\n1.86\n$\n10.36\n$\n8.50\nThe benefit from tax legislation on fourth quarter 2017 net income was primarily attributable to revaluation of deferred tax liabilities at the lower statutory tax rate. The net charge for significant items included the previously announced contribution to the PNC Foundation and employee cash payments and pension account credits, Visa Class B derivative fair value adjustments primarily related to extension of anticipated timing of litigation resolution, and charges for real estate dispositions and exits including datacenters. These items were partially offset by the flow through benefit of tax legislation from PNC's equity investment in BlackRock.

As a result, the amounts could be adjusted during the measurement period, which will end in December 2018.\nIncome Statement Highlights\nFourth quarter 2017 compared with third quarter 2017\nTotal revenue for the fourth quarter was $4.3 billion, an increase of $135 million, or 3 percent. Net interest income of $2.3 billion was stable with the third quarter. Excluding the impact of tax legislation, net interest income increased $26 million, or 1 percent, due to higher loan balances and higher loan and securities yields partially offset by higher deposit and borrowing costs. Net interest margin was 2.88 percent compared with 2.91 percent in the third quarter. The impact of tax legislation related to leveraged leases reduced the margin by 3 basis points. Noninterest income of $1.9 billion increased $135 million, or 8 percent, driven by strong fee income and a net benefit from significant items.\nNoninterest expense of $3.1 billion increased $605 million, or 25 percent. Excluding the impact of significant items, noninterest expense increased $103 million, or 4 percent, reflecting higher compensation and benefits costs including variable compensation associated with increased business activity.\nProvision for credit losses was $125 million, a decline of $5 million, as a higher provision for the consumer loan portfolio was more than offset by a lower provision for the commercial lending portfolio.\nBalance Sheet Highlights\nAverage loans grew $1.9 billion, or 1 percent, to $221.1 billion in the fourth quarter compared with the third quarter.\nAverage commercial lending balances increased $1.6 billion reflecting growth across PNC's business credit, real estate, corporate banking and equipment finance businesses.\nAverage consumer lending balances increased $.3 billion as growth in residential mortgage, auto and credit card loans was partially offset by lower home equity and education loans.\nOverall credit quality remained stable.\nNonperforming assets of $2.0 billion at December 31, 2017 decreased $32 million, or 2 percent, compared with September 30, 2017.\nNet charge-offs increased to $123 million for the fourth quarter compared with $106 million for the third quarter.\nAverage deposits increased $2.1 billion, or 1 percent, to $261.5 billion in the fourth quarter compared with the third quarter due to seasonal growth in commercial deposits.\nAverage investment securities decreased $.2 billion to $74.2 billion in the fourth quarter compared with the third quarter. Investment securities increased $1.1 billion to $76.1 billion at December 31, 2017 compared with September 30, 2017.\nPNC returned $.9 billion of capital to shareholders in the fourth quarter through repurchases of 3.7 million common shares for $.5 billion and dividends on common shares of $.4 billion.\nFor the full year 2017, PNC returned $3.6 billion of capital to shareholders through repurchases of 18.6 million common shares for $2.3 billion and dividends on common shares of $1.3 billion.\nPNC maintained strong capital and liquidity positions.\nTransitional Basel III common equity Tier 1 capital ratio was an estimated 10.4 percent at December 31, 2017 and 10.3 percent at September 30, 2017, calculated using the regulatory capital methodologies applicable to PNC during 2017.\nPro forma fully phased-in Basel III common equity Tier 1 capital ratio, a non-GAAP financial measure, was an estimated 9.8 percent at both December 31, 2017 and September 30, 2017, based on the standardized approach rules.\nThe Liquidity Covera", "external_links": ["http://www.pnc.com/secfilings", "http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/pnc-reports-record-full-year-2017-net-income-of-54-billion-1036-diluted-eps-300581936.html", "http://www.sec.gov/", "http://www.pnc.com/investorevents", "http://www.pnc.com/"], "published": "2018-01-12T14:50:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-12T15:53:14.005+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
