On Monday, the yield on the 10-year Treasury jumped to 2.727 percent, its highest since April 2014. \nAs expected, the central bank decided not to raise its benchmark interest rate on Wednesday, keeping it at 1.25 percent to 1.5 percent. However, the Fed indicated it expects inflation pressures to increase as the year goes on. \nAnother factor fueling Gross' \"mildly bearish\" view is the significant increase in Treasury issuance over the next 12 months. At the same time, the Fed is reducing is balance sheet, which is comprised mostly of Treasurys and mortgage-backed securities. \n\"The question becomes who's going to buy these bonds,\" Gross said. \"The public must be induced to buy them if interest rates go higher.\" \nâ€” CNBC's Jeff Cox contributed to this report.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-31T22:51:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-31T22:52:34.014+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
