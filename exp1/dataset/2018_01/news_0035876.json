But she doesn’t look happy. \nDawn is believed to be aged between 15 to 18 based on an analysis of her bones and teeth. She has a protruding jaw, thought to be caused by chewing on animal skin to make it into soft leather - a common practice among people of that era - and a scowling expression. \nAsked why she looked angry, orthodontics professor Manolis Papagrikorakis, who created a silicone reconstruction of her face from a terracotta mould of her head, joked: “It’s not possible for her not to be angry during such an era.” Slideshow (3 Images) \nDawn was possibly anemic and may have suffered from scurvy, the researchers said. Evidence also pointed to hip and joint problems, which may have made it difficult for her to move and may have contributed to her death. \nDiscovered in a cave in 1993, the girl was named Avgi - Greek for Dawn - because she lived during what is considered to be the dawn of civilization. \nTheopetra Cave, in the Thessaly region, was first inhabited about 100,000 years ago, according to the Culture Ministry. Stone tools from the Palaeolithic, Mesolithic and Neolithic periods have been discovered, as well as pottery from the Neolithic period. \nDawn is on display at the Acropolis Museum in Athens.
