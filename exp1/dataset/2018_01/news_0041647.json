That was the goal before the match today. Not under the circumstances I was hoping to (reach the final)... \n“He struggled clearly with his movement. I was able to take advantage of that. I wish him a good recovery.” \nIt was an anti-climactic end for Chung, who played superbly to beat fourth seed Alexander Zverev in five sets in round three and even better in a straight sets win over six-times champion Novak Djokovic in the round of 16. \nThe 21-year-old was joined by his agent Stuart Duguid in the post-match news conference who explained what had happened. \n“It’s worse than regular blisters. Over the last few days, it was blister under blister under blister,” he said. RED RAW \n“He had it shaved off. Now it’s red raw. They tried injections to see if it numbed the pain. It didn’t work.” \n“I really hurt. I can’t walk no more,” Chung added. \nFederer admitted after his quarter-final victory over Tomas Berdych that he knew little about Chung’s counter-punching game, having never faced him before. \nHe had obviously done some homework though as he swarmed all over the world number 58 from the first game, feasting on Chung’s powder puff serve to break immediately after choosing to receive first having won the coin toss. \nBashing winners for fun he repeated the trick twice to grab the opening set in 33 minutes. \nWhen Chung held serve for 1-1 in the second set, a huge cheer erupted from an Australia Day crowd who had hoped to witness a classic battle of the generations. \nBut Chung, nicknamed ‘the professor’ mainly because of his scholarly white spectacles but also because of a maturity beyond his years, had no answer to Federer’s firepower. \nWith his movement and defensive skills -- his biggest weapons -- compromised he was a sitting duck as Federer racked up 24 winners in the 57 points he required for victory. \nFederer broke for 3-1 with a dipping backhand pass and when Chung needed treatment on his foot blisters after losing the next game, his hopes of becoming the first South Korean to reach a grand slam final already looked forlorn. \nChung won one more game but after Federer held for 5-2 he walked to the net to offer his hand, departing the arena to sympathetic applause and a smattering of boos. \nWorld number two Federer now turns his attention to Cilic, who he has only lost to once in nine meetings. \nThe Croat’s sole victory, however, came in the U.S. Open semi-final in 2014 when he claimed his solitary major title.
