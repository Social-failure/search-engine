Wanted me to cut ribbon-NO!,\" Trump said on Twitter.\nThe Daily Mail earlier reported the cancellation of Trump's UK visit in which he was expected to inaugurate the new embassy. http://dailym.ai/2D5gtj2 \nThe United States is leaving behind an imposing 1960 stone and concrete embassy in London's upmarket Grosvenor Square - an area known as 'Little America' during World War Two, when the square also housed the military headquarters of General Dwight D. Eisenhower.\nThe new embassy on the South Bank is a veritable fortress set back at least 100 feet (30 meters) from surrounding buildings - mostly newly-erected high-rise residential blocks - and incorporating living quarters for the U.S. Marines permanently stationed inside.\nThe $1 billion construction, overlooking the River Thames, was wholly funded by the sale of other properties in London.
