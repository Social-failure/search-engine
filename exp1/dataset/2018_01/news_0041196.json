The boards of both companies have regularly scheduled meetings in the next couple of weeks and are expected to discuss the potential merger, the sources said.\nThe discussion, which took place earlier this month, were preliminary and no decisions have been made, but they signal that Moonves, who has had reservations about a potential deal between the companies, could be more open to the idea.\nThe sources wished to remain anonymous because they are not permitted to speak to the media. Viacom and CBS declined to comment. A spokeswoman for Shari Redstone did not immediately return calls.\nReporting By Jessica Toonkel in New York; Editing by Meredith Mazzilli\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-25T22:40:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-25T22:57:52.009+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
