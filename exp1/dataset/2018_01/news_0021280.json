He has consistently denied wrongdoing. \n”We cannot determine what the electorate will decide but we can offer our agenda for the people to decide,” Najib told reporters in Singapore when asked about the rail projects. \n“We believe they will decide on an agenda that’s very meaningful and productive.” \nLee expressed confidence that agreements would be honored by both countries. \nAs the deadline to award the high-speed project nears, the two states must choose between competing bids from Chinese, Japanese, European and South Korean firms, a decision expected by the end of the year. \nMalaysia leans toward China, which has pumped billions into Malaysia over the last two years as Najib looks to tackle massive government debt. \nBut Singapore’s relationship with China has deteriorated over issues such as self-ruled Taiwan, which China considers its own, and disputed South China Sea islands. \nThe railway is scheduled to be completed by 2026 and will cut the travel time between Kuala Lumpur and Singapore to about 90 minutes from the current four- to five-hour road journey. \nThe train journey from Singapore to Kuala Lumpur used to take about seven hours before the colonial-era Singapore station was closed in 2011 over sovereignty issues and the track in Singapore was pulled up.
