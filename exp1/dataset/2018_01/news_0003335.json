It’s rather about stating our positions clearly,” Seehofer said. \n“This project (of another grand coalition) can succeed if our potential coalition partner doesn’t take it too far,” he said. \nMerkel is under increasing pressure to reach a deal with the SPD, which also lost ground in the September election, but the two sides have bickered over a range of issues, notably immigration and taxation.
