The company announced Wednesda y the treatment would cost $850,000.\nUnder the terms of the deal, Sangamo will receive a $12 million upfront payment from Pfizer and an additional $150 million in milestone payments, the companies said.\nALS (amyotrophic lateral sclerosis), whose sufferers include renowned British physicist Stephen Hawking, attracted international attention in 2014 with the \"Ice Bucket Challenge\", in which people posted videos of pouring ice-cold water on themselves to encourage donations to research.\nShares of Sangamo were up 4.3 percent at $18.30, while those of Pfizer were unchanged.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-03T17:10:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-03T17:10:01.029+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
