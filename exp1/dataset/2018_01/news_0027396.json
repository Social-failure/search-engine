Elections in Cambodia have never been postponed.” \nSam Rainsy, a veteran foe of Hun Sen, recently announced the formation of a new opposition group - the Cambodia National Rescue Movement (CNRM), but some Cambodia-based members of the now banned opposition party have criticized the decision. \nSam Rainsy has lived in France since 2015 to avoid a series of convictions he says were politically motivated.
