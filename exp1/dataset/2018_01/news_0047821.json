It also listed nine entities, including the North Korean Ministry of Crude Oil Industry, and six North Korean-flagged ships. \nThe action enables the United States to block any assets held by the individuals or firms in the United States and prohibits U.S. citizens from dealing with any of the listed companies or individuals, the Treasury said.
