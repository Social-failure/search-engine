We’re going to see better earnings over the next 12 months and you need to buy stocks now to take advantage of that.”\nMore than three quarters of the 26 S&P 500 companies that have reported so far have topped profit estimates, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.\nAt 10:57 a.m. ET (1557 GMT), the Dow Jones industrial average was up 145.96 points, or 0.57 percent, at 25,949.15. If the index closes above 26,000, it would be the fastest 1,000-point rise. It ended above 25,000 on Jan. 4.\nBoeing, UnitedHealth and Merck were the biggest boosts to the Dow.\nThe S&P 500 was up 7.94 points, or 0.28 percent, at 2,794.18 and the Nasdaq Composite was up 39.01 points, or 0.54 percent, at 7,300.07.\nGeneral Motors rose 2.4 percent after the company said it expected earnings in 2018 to be largely flat, compared with 2017, but that profits should pick up pace in 2019.\nGeneral Electric fell more than 3 percent after raising the prospect of breaking itself up and announced more than $11 billion in charges from its long-term care insurance portfolio and new U.S. tax laws.\nThe S&P energy index fell 0.45 percent as Brent crude oil shed some of its recent gains, falling nearly $1 per barrel.\nSeven of the 11 major S&P sectors were higher, led by a 1.31 percent rise in the real estate index and a 0.72 percent gain in the healthcare index.\nMerck surged more than 7 percent after early results from a key study showed its blockbuster drug Keytruda and two chemotherapy medicines helped lung cancer patients live longer and stopped the disease from advancing.\nJohnson & Johnson rose 1.4 percent after brokerage Jefferies lifted its price target on the stock.\nAmazon rose 1.9 percent, extending gains from last week when data showed U.S. holiday spending surged to 12-year high, prompting price target hikes by brokerages.\nAdvancing issues outnumbered decliners on the NYSE by 1,793 to 1,051. On the Nasdaq, 1,845 issues rose and 1,016 fell.
