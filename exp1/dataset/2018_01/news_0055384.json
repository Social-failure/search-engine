The Stars stayed in fourth place in the Central Division with 60 points, only one point ahead of the Minnesota Wild.\nLaDue initiated the scoring at 3:05 of the first period, thanks to big efforts from linemates Alex Iafallo and Anze Kopitar. Iafallo kept the puck in the zone, and Kopitar skated around multiple defenders to set up LaDue in the right circle. LaDue wired a wrister past goalie Ben Bishop.\nDoughty made it 2-0 on the power play at 5:09 of the second period. Fellow defenseman Jake Muzzin teed him up at the right point for a one-timer that Bishop appeared to stop. However, the puck escaped Bishop and appeared to nick defenseman Stephen Johns in the skate just before crossing the goal line.\nMartinez added insurance only 65 seconds into the third period, shortly after a Dallas power play concluded. Bishop stopped Tanner Pearson on a breakaway, but Torrey Mitchell collected the rebound, and Martinez picked up the puck along the left boards. Martinez’s wrister tipped off a defender’s stick and beat Bishop to the short side.\nBishop made 39 saves in the losing effort as the Stars dropped their second consecutive game. Dallas failed to convert any of its four power-play chances.\n--Field Level Media\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-01-31T12:36:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-31T16:20:58.007+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
