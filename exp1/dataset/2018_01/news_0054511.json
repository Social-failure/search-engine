REUTERS/Hannibal Hanschke TOUGHER LINE \nThe SPD favours a more lenient approach towards those refugees seeking to bring to Germany family members whom they left behind in places like Syria and Iraq. \nBut the conservatives now hew to a tougher line on immigration to avoid losing more votes to the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD), which surged into parliament for the first time in the September election. \nAlthough the talks on family reunions broke off overnight without agreement, SPD deputy leader Malu Dreyer had earlier sounded a more optimistic note than Schulz, saying the parties were in the “final stages” of clinching an accord on this issue. \nDreyer told Deutschlandfunk radio there was a will among the negotiators “that we really reach an agreement today”. Related Coverage Merkel's embrace splits German Social Democrats over party identity \nRepresentatives of the SPD and conservatives told Reuters that suggestions to include a pledge in the coalition deal to raise taxes on petrol, gas and heating oil had met with strong resistance during talks on Sunday. \nThe idea had been to use the extra revenues to reduce the cost of electricity or promote environmentally-friendly fuels. But the Christian Social Union (CSU) - the Bavarian sister party of Merkel’s conservatives - was especially concerned that higher prices for heating oil could harm their chances in Bavaria’s regional election this year, the sources said. \nOtherwise, they said negotiations in the working group that focuses on the environment and energy had been constructive. The group supported an extra paragraph on energy efficiency to be added to the coalition blueprint, which would also ensure that building renovations were tax-deductible.
