The ECB said it should revisit its policy message in early 2018 and gradually adjust its language to reflect improved growth prospects.\nNervousness about reduced central bank accommodation has put pressure on bonds since the Bank of Japan said on Tuesday it will trim its purchases of Japanese government bonds.\nThe back up in yields nonetheless helped draw buyers to the Treasury Department’s $12 billion auction of 30-year bonds, the final sale of $56 billion in coupon-bearing supply this week.\n“It was a very good auction,” said Subadra Rajappa, head of U.S. rates strategy at Societe Generale in New York. “Typically (for long-dated debt) if you see a decent amount of a sell-off you tend to see buyers coming in, and that’s exactly what you saw in today’s auction.”\nIndirect bidders, which includes fund managers, insurance companies and other bidders, took a record share of 71.49 percent of the sale while dealers took a record low, at 21.23 percent.\nThe bonds sold at yields that were more than 2 basis points lower than where they had traded before the sale.\nInvestors are next focused on Friday’s consumer price data for December. November’s core inflation report disappointed investors by unexpectedly slowing.\nData on Thursday showed U.S. producer prices fell for the first time in nearly 1-1/2 years in December amid declining costs for services.
