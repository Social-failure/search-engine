Battery raw material lithium, for example, is not rare and there could be surplus supply after a rash of new mining projects come on stream. \nTechnology is also changing rapidly as car manufacturers look for the cheapest solutions, which could mean different resources are required. \nOf the major miners, Glencore provides the biggest exposure to battery minerals and its share price outperformed last year. BHP, meanwhile, has said it will steer clear of minerals needed only for batteries and focus on those with more certain demand. \nLondon-based Westbeck’s new fund, which will invest in smaller and less-liquid companies, will run alongside its Westbeck Energy Opportunity Fund. \nThe oil-focused Energy Opportunity Fund is up 20 percent in the first two weeks of January after losing 14 percent in 2017, before fees, the source said. \nWestbeck was set up in 2016 by former CQS Asset Management portfolio manager Will Smith, Jean-Louis Le Mee, who was previously at oil hedge fund firm BlueGold Capital, and Jon Mellberg, former head of Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. \nSmith and Le Mee will run the new fund with trained physicist Jon Hykawy, who recently joined as head of research and partner. \nThe fund will charge a 1.5 percent performance fee and 15 percent management fee, the presentation showed.
