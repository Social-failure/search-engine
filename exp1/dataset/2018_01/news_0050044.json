Your expectation will quicken the process and keep you on track.\"\nSurround yourself with successful people Who you hang out with matters.\n\"You need rich friends,\" says Siebold. \"The sheer exposure to their heightened level of awareness around everything related to wealth will dramatically expand your thinking.\"\nFind ways to cultivate relationships with wealthy, successful people: \"Read their books, attend their events, donate to their charities … and whatever else you can do to gain introductions and build relationships.\"\nshow chapters Cut your kids off as soon as you possibly can, says Suze Orman 1:11 PM ET Mon, 31 July 2017 | 00:54 Fall in love with work Your career affects every aspect of your life, so you want to choose your path carefully.\n\"It's difficult to invest the necessary time and energy into a profession that bores you or that has little meaning beyond money,\" says Siebold. \"Waking up everyday with excitement for going to work is a formula for financial abundance, emotional fulfillment, and life satisfaction.\"\nMoney solves most problems The rich aren't afraid to admit that money can solve most problems.\n\"Being rich won't make you happy, but it will solve 90 percent of your problems,\" writes Siebold. \"If you have a problem, and you can make it disappear by writing a check, you don't have a problem. … Make your money by solving problems, and you'll get rich enough to purchase your own problems away.\"\nshow chapters Thirteen things mentally strong parents don't do 12:57 PM ET Fri, 6 Oct 2017 | 02:14 Invest \"The rich are investors , not spenders,\" says Siebold. \"They invest their money today, so they'll have more tomorrow.\"\nTo be a successful investor, stick to what you know or what you're interested in: \"If you like to play guitars, you might study the vintage guitar market. If you're a baseball fan, look into investing in rare baseball cards. If you like dissecting stocks, you could study the stock market.\"\nSpend smart No matter how big your paycheck is, you won't be rich unless you're disciplined enough to keep what you make. \"Excessive spending can ruin you,\" warns Siebold. \"It happens every day to people with millions of dollars at their disposal.\"\nThat's not to say you should never spend: \"Just make sure you don't overextend yourself in the process because that will put you on a treadmill of having and not having money.\"\nshow chapters Rich people use these 6 mental tricks to make more money 12:09 PM ET Fri, 2 June 2017 | 01:10 You deserve to make it The top earners tell themselves they deserve to be rich, while the masses think getting rich is reserved for a lucky few.\nThe truth is, \"in a free market economy like America, if you serve enough people and solve enough problems, you deserve to be rich,\" says Siebold.\n\"The only people who tell you that the self-made rich don't deserve it are people that have never done it. Believe me, by the time you get rich, you'll be convinced that you've earned it.\"\nMoney and opportunity are limitless Rich people see money as abundant. After all, \"If earning money is based on solving problems, and the number of problems is infinite, then your ability to earn money is infinite,\" says Siebold.\n\"Reject the mass belief that money is a scarce resource. … It's not. What is scarce are people with solutions that others want to buy, and that's what you need to master.\"\nshow chapters Simple steps to get rich from a self-made millionaire 8:25 AM ET Thu, 23 March 2017 | 00:54 Choose prosperity over entertainment The rich use their time differently than the average person, says Siebold: \"The masses spend their time, while the rich invest in it.\n\"Spend your time basking in entertainment, and you will struggle your entire life financially. Invest your time creating solutions to people's problems, and you'll never lose a minutes sleep worrying about how to pay the mortgage.\"\nFocus on earning The quickest way to get rich is to generate multiple revenue streams .\nWhile you want to focus on earning , keep the big picture in mind, too. \"Total focus on money might lead you to do anything to get it, so I don't recommend that approach,\" says Siebold. \"Instead, decide to match your talents and interests with a problem people will pay you to solve and go to work until you succeed.
