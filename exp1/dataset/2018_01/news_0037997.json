Militants have in the past carried out raids on checkpoints and towns nearby.\nThe interior ministry said their forces on Sunday found the body of another militant killed during Saturday’s operation.\n“This terrorist is an Algerian named Bechir Ben Neji and he was the leader of Okba Ibn Nafaa in the Semmama mountain,” it said. Last year security forces killed militants including Algerian Mourad Chaieb, former leader of Okba Ibn Nafaa.\nTunisia has been on high alert since 2015 when militants killed dozens of tourists.\nIslamic State claim most major attacks in Tunisia including a hotel attack and an attack on a museum that killed dozens of tourists in 2015 as well as raids by militants who crossed from Libya into Tunisia in 2016.\nMore than 3,000 Tunisians have left over the last few years to fight for Islamic State and other militant groups in Iraq, Syria and Libya. Authorities are trying to prepare for the threat posed by their return.\nEditing by Matthew Mpoke Bigg\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-21T19:44:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-21T20:17:34.016+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
