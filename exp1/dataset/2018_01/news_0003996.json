The updated guidance reflects holiday period sales performance and current expectations for the remainder of the quarter.\nThe Company now expects net sales for the fourth quarter ending February 3, 2018 in the range of $137 million to $139 million, assuming a 15% to 17% decrease in comparable sales. This compares to previous guidance of net sales in the range of $145 million to $150 million, assuming a 9% to 12% decrease in comparable sales. Fourth quarter diluted earnings per share are expected to be in the range of $0.18 to $0.23 compared to the Company’s previous guidance range of $0.35 to $0.40. Fiscal year 2017 diluted earnings per share are now expected to be in the range of $0.50 to $0.55. This EPS guidance excludes the impact of the recently adopted tax law. It is expected the new tax law will increase the fourth quarter tax expense as the Company’s deferred tax asset will be reduced due to the lower federal tax rate.\nSteve Lawrence, President and Chief Executive Officer, stated, “Our Holiday performance was disappointing as challenging conversion rates and traffic trends that started in the third quarter persisted into the holiday season. We were not able to recapture momentum as rapidly as we expected but we believe that we are taking the necessary steps to reinvigorate our merchandise assortment and to drive traffic to our boutiques and online going forward. We are confident we are taking the right actions to regain momentum in our business and believe we will see sequential improvement as we continue to execute on these initiatives.”\nICR Conference\nAs previously announced, the Company will be presenting at the 20 th Annual ICR Conference to be held at the JW Marriott Orlando Grande Lakes in Orlando, Florida on Monday, January 8, 2018 at 2:30 pm ET. Mr. Lawrence and Ms. Kelly Dilts, Chief Financial Officer, will host the presentation.\nThe presentation will be webcast live at www.francescas.com under the Investor Relations section. An archived replay will be available two hours after the conclusion of the live event and will remain on the website for ninety days.\nForward-Looking Statements\nCertain statements in this release are \"forward-looking statements\" made pursuant to the safe-harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, as amended.
