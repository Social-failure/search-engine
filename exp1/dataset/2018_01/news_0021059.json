REUTERS/Hannibal Hanschke/File Photo “If one looks at similar terrorist situations throughout Europe, the capitals were often affected,” GSG-9 commander Jerome Fuchs told Berlin public radio, adding that the goal of moving to Berlin was to have fast responsiveness in the capital.\nDozens of people have been killed in militant attacks in major European cities like Paris, Barcelona, Nice, Brussels and London over the past three years, making security a top priority for many European Union countries.\nGermany’s GSG-9 unit is currently based in Sankt Augustin, a town near the city of Bonn.\nGSG-9 commando grabbed international attention in 1977 when it succeeded in freeing a Lufthansa plane that was hijacked by a Palestinian militia and flown to Mogadishu, Somalia.\n(This story corrects name of broadcaster in paragraph 6)\nReporting by Riham Alkousaa; editing by Ralph Boulton\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-01-15T20:24:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-16T13:34:47.007+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
