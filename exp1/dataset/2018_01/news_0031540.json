Pai has said Hawaii apparently did not have adequate safeguards in place and that government officials must work to prevent future incidents. \nHouse Energy and Commerce Committee Chairman Greg Walden, a Republican, told Reuters this week he wanted to know if additional checks and balances were needed for alerts of international significance. \n“You’d think there would be another authentication along the way before something like that went out,” Walden said. \nPolicymakers are working to improve the alerting systems. \nIn November, the FCC approved the use of new technology known as ATSC 3.0 that uses precision broadcasting and targets emergency or weather alerts on a street-by-street basis. The alerts could include maps, storm tracks and evacuation routes, the FCC said. \nPai noted Thursday that the technology “has the capability to send a signal that will wake up sleeping devices so that all consumers will be warned of imminent emergencies even if their device is turned off. And those warnings can be sent in multiple languages.” \nTo prevent a repeat of the incident, Hawaii’s Emergency Management Agency has said it will require two employees to activate the alert system - one to issue the warning and another to confirm it.
