The committee’s practice is not to comment on specific witnesses or the schedule for testimony at non-public hearings. \nSeparately, Representative Adam Schiff, the panel’s top Democrat, told reporters on Thursday he would like “dozens” more witnesses, including Bannon, to appear before the committee, making clear he does not view its investigation of Russia and the election as near its end. \nSome of Trump’s fellow Republicans in Congress have been saying they expect the House Intelligence probe and other congressional investigations to wrap up quickly. Democrats have been disputing this, saying there is much work remaining to determine whether Russia attempted to influence the election on Trump’s behalf or whether Trump colluded. \nMoscow denies trying to meddle in the election, and Trump dismisses talk of collusion. \n“There are still dozens of witnesses that we could bring in,” Schiff told reporters. \nBesides Bannon, he said those witnesses would include Trump’s daughter Ivanka. He also said he would like Trump’s son-in-law Jared Kushner to appear again before the committee while noting that the choice of witnesses is determined by the panel’s Republican leadership.
