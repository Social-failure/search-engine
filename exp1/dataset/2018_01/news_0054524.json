As this process unfolds, I have made the decision to step aside as President and take a step back for someone else to lead us through the hard work,” Dykstra said on Twitter. \nHe did not respond to a Reuters request for comment Monday. \nThe government’s legislation would outline procedures from employers to deal with allegations of harassment and bullying, add the option of an outside investigator, and enforce privacy rules to protect victims. \nPreviously, if an employee had a complaint about a member of Parliament, they had to work through the party or the speaker of the House of Commons to resolve the issue. \nIn the United States, sexual harassment allegations have also engulfed men in politics, business and the workplace, inspired by the #MeToo social media movement supported by victims of sexual harassment or abuse.
