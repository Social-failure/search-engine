In 2018, we will probably do better than our forecast of 1.7 percent,” Le Maire said in a New Year’s speech to economic experts.\nLe Maire said he had signed documents on Monday officially setting up a new 10 billion euro ($12.3 billion) fund aimed at boosting future growth by financing innovation.\nHe said it would initially be composed of 1.6 billion euros in proceeds from the sale last year of Engie and Renault shares and would include 8.4 billion euros in EDF and Thales shares, which remain government property.
