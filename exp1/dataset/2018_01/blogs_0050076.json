He had mentors, teachers and colleagues that helped him develop his smart investing style over time. People like Benjamin Graham, David Dodd and Phil Fisher helped him develop the tools necessary to build a $92.5 billion empire . \nGraham, known as the godfather of value investing, greatly impacted Buffett's investment philosophy when he was his professor at Columbia Business School.
