Progress toward an end to political deadlock in Germany helped the mood. \nThe pan-European STOXX 600 index was up 0.3 percent, with major indices rising in France and Germany. UK's FTSE .FTSE was the main exception, dropping 0.2 percent.

Perhaps this is more fractious and may take longer to resolve, but it shouldn’t have a massive economic impact,” said Patrick O‘Donnell, investment manager at Aberdeen Asset Management. DOLLAR NEAR THREE-YEAR LOW \nThe dollar remained stuck near three-year lows, continuing its weak start to the year .DXY. The dollar index .DXY fell 0.17 percent, with the euro EUR= up 0.25 percent to $1.225. \nIn European bond markets, Spain’s borrowing costs ES10YT=TWEB dropped to a six-week low and the gap over its German peers DE10YT=TWEB fell to its tightest in almost three years after Fitch Ratings gave Spain its first “A” rating since the euro zone debt crisis. \nGreece’s short-dated yields GR2YT=TWEBGR5YT=TWEB also fell after S&P Global Ratings upgraded the country’s credit ratings for the first time in two years. \nMost other euro zone bond yields were little changed. Analysts said investors were probably moving to the sidelines before the European Central Bank’s first meeting of 2018 this Thursday. \nOil prices climbed after Saudi Arabia commented that cooperation between oil producers who have cut production to boost prices would continue beyond 2018. U.S. crude CLcv1 rose 0.98 percent to $63.93 per barrel and Brent LCOcv1 was last at $69.30, up 1.01 percent on the day. \nSpot gold XAU= added 0.2 percent to $1,334.12 an ounce. U.S. gold futures GCcv1 gained 0.05 percent to $1,333.80 an ounce.
