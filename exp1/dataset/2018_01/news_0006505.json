We had to drag her away,” Pataki said. He said many dogs would have died after such a trauma.\n“But yesterday she was on her feet again and even wagged her tail.”\nPolice said the 66-year old woman appeared to have died of natural causes.\nReporting by Krisztina Than; Editing by Richard Balmforth\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-05T17:15:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-05T17:34:45.014+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
