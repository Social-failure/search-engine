Validus surged 45 percent.\nNine of the 11 major S&P sectors were higher, led by a 1.1 percent gain in the energy index and 0.9 percent rise in utilities index.\nHalliburton Co rose 4.2 percent after posting a much bigger-than-expected quarterly profit in the fourth quarter, benefiting from a shale-driven surge in U.S. oil production.\nShares of Netflix Inc, a major contributor to the recent stock rally, were up about nearly 3 percent ahead of its quarterly results after market closes.\nAdvancing issues outnumbered decliners on the NYSE by 1,498 to 1,258.
