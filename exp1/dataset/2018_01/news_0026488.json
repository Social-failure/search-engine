It added it sees the most obvious step, if any, as a sale of Costa. \nThe Premier Inn and restaurants business generated operating profit of 468 million pounds in 2016-17 on revenue of 1.9 billion pounds. Costa made 158 million pounds from 1.2 billion pounds of revenue. TOUGH TIMES FILE PHOTO: Signage for Premier Inn is seen on the outside of one of their hotels in London, Britain, March 30, 2016. REUTERS/Toby Melville/File Photo/File Photo \nWhitbread blamed a tough British high street environment for a slip in Costa Coffee sales, while like-for-like sales across the group rose only marginally in the third quarter. \nCosta’s comparable UK sales declined 0.1 percent in the 13 weeks ended Nov. 30, the latest sign of pressure on the UK high street after a string of weak trading updates from retailers. \n“We do expect the tough UK high street environment and inflation in our sector to continue to pose challenges in the year ahead,” Brittain said in a statement. \nWhitbread, which began life as a brewer more than 275 years ago, said it was trying newer blends of coffee and food options in response. \nComparable sales growth in the UK at Premier Inn, which has over 65,000 rooms in the country, increased 0.5 percent in the third quarter. Across the group as a whole, there was a 0.3 percent rise in UK comparable sales. \nWhitbread said there were signs of weakness in the hotel market, most notably in London, with both occupancy and average room rates declining year-on-year. \nLike-for-like sales fell 5.6 percent for the third quarter for its London hotels, with comparable RevPAR -- a key industry metric -- down 5.8 percent. \nPremier Inn -- which has a lot of exposure to the London market -- has had to cope with a slowdown in the capital, blamed in part on a series of attacks by militants last year. \nThe business also faces competition from online holiday rental startups such as Airbnb.
