Courtesy of TWITTER/ @ABRAMJEE /via REUTERS \nThe Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) protesters targeted six H&M stores in the Gauteng province, where South Africa’s economic hub of Johannesburg is located, tearing down shop displays and throwing clothes around, police said. \nIn one instance, officers fired rubber bullets to disperse the protesters, the police added. \nH&M earlier this week issued an apology for the widely criticized ad, which featured a black child modeling a sweatshirt with the slogan “coolest monkey in the jungle”, and said it had removed it from all its marketing. \nBut Mbuyiseni Ndlozi, spokesman for the ultra-left EFF, said that was too little, too late.
