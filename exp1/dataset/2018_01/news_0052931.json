REUTERS/Thomas Peter “There has been no fundamental change to the situation of Xinjiang being in a time of regular violent terror activities, an intense struggle against separatists and the painful throes of an intervention treatment,” Zakir said.\nHe added that the long-term peace and stability of Xinjiang and its society must be the overall goal of the regional government for the “critical period” of the next five years.\nA police officer talks to men in a street in Kashgar, Xinjiang Uighur Autonomous Region, China, March 24, 2017. REUTERS/Thomas Peter To meet this goal, the government will continue to deepen severe specialist operations, such as guaranteeing absolute security of key areas and the “normalization” of preventative measures in society, Zakir said.\nChina blames the violence in Xinjiang on Islamist extremists and separatists, some of whom it says have links to groups outside the country.\nRights groups and Uighur exiles say it is more a product of Uighur frustration at Chinese controls on their culture and religion. China denies any repression.\nReporting by Christian Shepherd\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-29T11:07:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-29T11:15:24.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
