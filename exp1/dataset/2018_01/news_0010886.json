( on.ft.com/2Fk9jVv )\nThe report comes less than a month after Fox agreed to sell its film, television and international businesses to Walt Disney Co for $52.4 billion in stock.\nThe Sinclair channels being sold will include some in important U.S. National Football League markets, such as Seattle and Denver, to ease the regulatory process, the FT said.\nThe deal will also help Fox monetize its NFL rights better, the FT reported.\nThe sales will be in regions where Sinclair owns two “full power” stations, prohibited under the current Federal Communications Commission rules, the FT said.\nFox and Sinclair did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
