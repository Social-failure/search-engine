It prefers to list in Hong Kong, the person said, adding the IPO plan has not been finalized.\nThe fundraising by seven-year-old Kuaishou, meaning “fast hand” in Chinese, comes as live streaming in China has seen rapid growth, attracting a rush of investment led by tech heavyweights Tencent, Alibaba Group Holding and Baidu Inc. They hope live streaming can boost their existing offerings in e-commerce, social networking and gaming.\nKuaishou declined to comment. Tencent and Sequoia China did not immediately respond to requests for comments. The sources declined to be named as the information was confidential.
