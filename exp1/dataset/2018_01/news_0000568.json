It is expected that both locations will be fully operational early in 2018.\nThese acquisitions represent the commencement of the Company’s strategic plans to establish itself as a presence in the U.S. direct-to-consumer pharmaceuticals business.\nGenerex is actively pursuing acquisitions of turnkey retail pharmacy operations with multiple product lines in more than a dozen U.S. states, some of which have received accreditation from the Utilization Review Accreditation Commission (URAC®) and the Verified Internet Pharmacy Practices Sites (VIPPS) program of the National Association of Boards of Pharmacy. This acquisitions strategy includes national marketing, customer service, operations, pharmacy technicians, physician order verification, information technology (including proprietary Data Analytics and Customer Relationship Management (CRM) systems and E-Commerce), warehousing, finance, and human resources with a view to establishing a foundational infrastructure generating significant revenues/EBITDA.\nGenerex President & Chief Executive Officer Joseph Moscato stated: “These initial acquisitions are part of a larger strategic plan developed over the past eight months to establish a nationwide direct-to-consumer monthly patient treatment solution. We expect this substantial new enterprise to unfold in NuGenerex Distribution Solutions, LLC in the coming months as audits and due diligence investigations are undertaken. I look forward to providing further color during our investor conference call tomorrow.”\nCautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\nThis release and oral statements made from time to time by Generex representatives in respect of the same subject matter may contain \"forward-looking statements\" within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.
