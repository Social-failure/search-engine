He has fired a cabinet member and a dozen senior officials over allegations of corruption, but no cases have been filed against them.\n($1=51.2740 Philippine pesos)\nReporting by Manuel Mogato; Editing by Clarence Fernandez\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-31T15:09:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-31T15:18:17.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
