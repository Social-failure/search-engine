He then struck decisively in the 21st game of the set when he moved forward to force a forehand error from his opponent. \nHe completed victory a game later with a nerveless backhand volley and now sets his sights on another battle. \nKarlovic, a gentle giant off the court, said he still loved the combat and would keep playing as long as his serve keeps firing him to victories like Wednesday‘s. \n“I still like it, that’s why I‘m still here and doing it,” he said. “We’ll see how much longer I carry on.” \nTurning his thoughts to Seppi, he said he was prepared for another slog. \n“It’s going to be very tough because he returns unbelievably,” he said. “I will try to play my game and we will see. It’s going to be very hot and that will make my serve a little faster. But it will not be easy.” (Reporting by Martyn Herman; Editing by Amlan Chakraborty/Nick Mulvenney)", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-17T11:59:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-17T12:30:31.013+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
