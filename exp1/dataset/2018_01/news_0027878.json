The two swimmers were exhausted but unharmed. \nBarilaro said the state government had invested A$430,000 ($343,000) in a trial of drone technology in December. \nAustralia, most of whose 24 million live on the coast, had 291 drownings in the year to June 30, a small increase over the previous year but a decline on a per capita basis, according to the Royal Life Saving Society. \nForty people have drowned in the 2017/18 summer, down from 69 at the same time last year, the group said.
