Its international business grew by just under a third. Full results will be published on March 21.\nHelloFresh, majority-owned by German e-commerce group Rocket Internet, also said it had reined in losses and was on track to reach group profitability by the fourth quarter of this year.\nHelloFresh shares, which have performed well since their listing, were up 6.5 percent by 0908 GMT.\nBy contrast, shares in Blue Apron have tumbled since its own listing in late June, particularly after Amazon.com registered a trademark for a possible rival service.\nBoth firms faces mounting competition from deep-pocketed rivals such as Amazon.com as it moves to increase food delivery services after acquiring the Whole Earth Foods grocery chain in August. U.S. supermarket chain Albertsons acquired meal-kit rival Plated in September.\n$1 = 0.8091 euros Reporting by Emma Thomasson; Editing by Mark Potter\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-01-30T16:24:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-31T16:45:03.002+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
