Both lawmakers are vocal critics of the Venezuelan government. \nIn their letter, they raised concerns that the situation in Venezuela could destabilise the region.

REUTERS/Marco Bello \nThe Venezuelan Information Ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment. In the past, Maduro has dismissed accusations about drug trafficking links as a smear campaign by Washington, adding that the United States is to blame for the drug trade because it is such a large market for illegal narcotics. \nOn Aug. 1, 2016, a U.S. District Court announced the indictment of Nestor Reverol, who is now Venezuela’s interior minister, on charges of participating in an international cocaine trafficking conspiracy. In February 2017, the U.S. Treasury Department imposed sanctions against Venezuelan Vice President Tareck el-Aissami for drug trafficking and other related crimes. \nAnd in December 2017, two nephews of Maduro’s wife, Franqui Francisco Flores de Freitas and Efrain Antonio Campo Flores, were convicted in U.S. federal court for drug smuggling. \nThe European Union announced new sanctions on several senior Venezuelan officials, including Reverol, on Monday, saying this was an expression of the bloc’s concern with the political crisis under Maduro. \nRubio and Menendez also asked Sessions to support efforts by the Organization of American States to address human rights concerns in Venezuela. \nA Justice Department spokeswoman did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the letter, which was sent on Wednesday.
