The positive week came despite the broader European market was little changed in percentage terms with the STOXX 600 up less than 0.1 percent so far this week. At the country level there were divergences: \"flows into Sweden and UK Equity Funds hit 12 and 39-week highs while France Equity Funds saw their three-week inflow streak snapped and Italy Equity Funds experienced net redemptions for the 11th time in the past 12 weeks,\" he added. On sectors globally, cyclicals dominated. Financials, Industrials and Technology Sector Funds all took in over $600 million during the week ending Jan. 17 while Real Estate Sector Funds recorded their biggest outflow since late October, he said.
