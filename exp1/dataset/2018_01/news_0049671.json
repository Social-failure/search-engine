Often in Monte Carlo you have to face hard conditions, but this has been extremely difficult,” said Ogier.\n“I’ve never struggled with the tyre choices so much, but in the end we win and I‘m super happy. I need to thank the team for another good start to the season. Every driver did mistakes this weekend - I did too. I made a few less.”\nOgier joined M-Sport last season after Volkswagen, with whom he won his first four titles, pulled out as part of a strategic shift to help the German carmaker overcome a costly emissions scandal.\nThe Frenchman won only four of the 17 stages, including three of the first four, but always had his rivals in check in sometimes muddy conditions.\nThe next leg of the world championships is the Rally Sweden from Feb. 15-18.\nReporting by Julien Pretot; Editing by Pritha Sarkar\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-28T16:21:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-28T16:32:18.016+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
