REUTERS/Jung Yeon-Je/Pool \nForeign Minister Kang Kyung-wha will hold a news conference to say what measures the government intends taking to follow up on a public-private panel that concluded last week that the accord had failed to meet the women’s needs, a foreign ministry official told Reuters on Monday. \nSouth Korean President Moon Jae-in has said the deal, under which Japan apologised to victims and provided 1 billion yen (£6.45 million) to a fund to help them, was seriously flawed. Japan said any attempt to revise it could damage relations.
