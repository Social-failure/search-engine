But he added: “Corporations should pay their fair share of tax. We cannot tolerate a situation where large companies can avoid paying any taxes anywhere.” \nAnd underlining that it was not just U.S. multinationals like Apple in Ireland that may benefit but also local firms in big European manufacturing nations, he said: “That’s as true for American tech companies as it is for European car manufacturers or for international aerospace and defence companies.” \nIreland was not in a “race to the bottom” on corporate tax, he said, arguing that in any case it was not one it could win. \nEurope risked putting itself at a disadvantage to rivals such as the United States, Japan or post-Brexit Britain by working alone to close tax loopholes, Varadkar said. The European Union should, he said, seek global rules through the OECD. \n“If the United States, the most successful economy in the world, can have tax competition among member states why can’t we have the same,” Varadkar said. \nIreland has found an ally in Hungary on the issue, both expressing strong opposition earlier this month to any effort to harmonise corporate and other tax rules across the European Union.
