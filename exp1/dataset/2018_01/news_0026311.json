I only want to talk about his performances.” \nRonaldo collected a joint-record fifth Ballon d‘Or award in December but has only scored four times in La Liga this season, a huge factor in the Spanish and European champions limp title defence. Soccer Football - La Liga Santander - Real Madrid vs Villarreal - Santiago Bernabeu, Madrid, Spain - January 13, 2018 Real Madrid coach Zinedine Zidane REUTERS/Javier Barbancho \nReal have fallen a remarkable 19 points behind runaway league leaders Barcelona and are currently fourth in the standings, trailing second-placed Atletico Madrid by 10 points and third-placed Valencia by eight, although they have played one game less. \n“Everyone loves him for everything he has done. We are in a difficult moment right now but he is still with us,” Zidane added. \n“Cristiano is old enough to deal with the club himself. I only talk to him about what goes on the pitch. He manages what goes on off it.” \nEarlier on Wednesday, Real great Manolo Sanchis said the club should resist Ronaldo’s demands for a pay hike. \n“Madrid don’t need to increase his (Ronaldo‘s) salary,” Sanchis, who won eight Liga titles and two Champions Leagues with the club between 1983 and 2001, told Spanish radio station Cadena Cope. \n“If Madrid collapse this season, he will be on his way out. (Alfredo) Di Stefano left Madrid so anyone can leave now without it causing a big drama.” Reporting by Richard Martin; Editing by Christian Radnedge", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-17T15:05:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-17T15:26:05.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
