Under the policy, Valero and other oil refiners must mix ethanol with gasoline or buy paper credits to comply. Valero in 2016 spent $750 million buying the fuel credits. \nThe company sought to shift the point of obligation in the ethanol policy from refiners to others such as fuel station owners - a proposal that it had urged RFA to support. \nHowever, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency in October dealt a blow to those efforts when it declined to reform the rule. \nValero spokeswoman Lillian Riojas in the statement said the company did not renew its RFA membership due to cost cutting in associations. “As one of the nation’s largest producers of renewable fuels, we expect to continue to work with RFA on the issues that impact our renewables business,” she added. \nBob Dinneen, president of the RFA, confirmed Valero was no longer a member of the group.
