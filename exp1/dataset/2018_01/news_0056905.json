Diluted earnings per share were $0.13 for the fourth quarter of 2017, compared to $0.54 for the fourth quarter of 2016. Net income for the fourth quarter of 2017 includes a one-time income tax expense of $7,416,000 due to the re-measurement of the Company’s net deferred tax asset (“DTA”) resulting from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017. Also included in net income for the fourth quarter of 2017 is $530,000 of merger and acquisition expenses related to the proposed merger with FNB Bancorp (“FNBB”) previously announced on December 11, 2017. Excluding the impact of the FNBB related merger expenses, and the DTA re-measurement, net income totaled $10,896,000 for the fourth quarter of 2017, or $0.47 per diluted share.\nNet income was $40,554,000 for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to $44,811,000 for the year ended December 31, 2016. Diluted earnings per share were $1.74 for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to $1.94 for the year ended December 31, 2016. Excluding the impact of the FNBB related merger expenses, and the DTA re-measurement, net income totaled $48,462,000 for the year ended December 31, 2017, or $2.08 per diluted share. Net income for twelve months ended December 31, 2016 include the effects of $784,000 of expenses related to the acquisition of three bank branches, including $161,231,000 of deposits, during the three months ended March 31, 2016. Excluding the impact of the branch acquisition expenses, net income totaled $45,266,000 for the year ended December 31, 2016, or $1.96 per diluted share.\nOn December 22, 2017, President Donald Trump signed into law \"H.R.1\", commonly known as the \"Tax Cuts and Jobs Act\", which among other items reduces the Federal corporate tax rate from 35% to 21% effective January 1, 2018. While this decrease in the Federal corporate tax rate is expected to have a positive impact on the Company’s net income beginning January 1, 2018, the Company concluded that this caused the Company’s DTA to be reduced, and Federal income tax expense to be increased by $7,416,000 during the fourth quarter of 2017.\nIn addition to the nonrecurring income statement items noted above, there were other expense and revenue items during the three months ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 of less significance that may be considered nonrecurring and these items are described below in various sections of this announcement.\nPerformance highlights and other developments for the Company during the three months ended December 31, 2017 included the following:\nOn December 11, 2017, TriCo and FNBB announced that they entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger and Reorganization (the “Merger Agreement”) pursuant to which FNBB will be merged with and into the Company, with the Company as the surviving corporation (the “Merger”). The Merger Agreement provides that immediately after the Merger, FNBB’s bank subsidiary, First National Bank of Northern California, will merge with and into the Company’s bank subsidiary, Tri Counties Bank, with Tri Counties Bank as the surviving bank. Loan balances increased $83,552,000 representing a 2.9% increase in total loans, and an annualized growth rate of 11.4%, during the three months ended December 31, 2017. The average rate of interest paid on deposits, including the effect of noninterest-bearing deposits, remained low at 0.11%.\nThe following is a summary of the components of the Company’s consolidated net income, average common shares, and average diluted common shares outstanding for the periods indicated:\nThree months ended December 31, (dollars and shares in thousands) 2017 2016 $ Change\n% Change Net Interest Income $ 45,093 $ 43,155 $ 1,938 4.5 % (Provision for) reversal of loan losses (1,677 ) 1,433 (3,110 ) Noninterest income 12,478 12,462 16 0.1 % Noninterest expense (38,076 ) (36,563 ) (1,513 ) 4.1 % Provision for income taxes (14,829 ) (7,954 ) (6,875 ) 86.4 % Net income $ 2,989 $ 12,533 ($9,544 ) (76.2 %) Average common shares 22,945 22,846 99 0.4 % Average diluted common shares 23,290 23,116 174 0.8 % The following is a summary of certain of the Company’s consolidated assets and deposits as of the dates indicated:\nEnding balances As of December 31, ($'s in thousands) 2017 2016 $ Change\n% Change Total assets $ 4,761,315 $ 4,517,968 $ 243,347 5.4 % Total loans 3,015,165 2,759,593 255,572 9.3 % Total investments 1,262,683 1,169,725 92,958 7.9 % Total deposits 4,009,131 3,895,560 $ 113,571 2.9 % Qtrly avg balances As of December 31, ($'s in thousands) 2017 2016 $ Change\n% Change Total assets $ 4,658,677 $ 4,483,251 $ 175,426 3.9 % Total loans $ 2,948,277 $ 2,730,391 217,886 8.0 % Total investments 1,254,868 1,166,410 88,458 7.6 % Total deposits $ 3,961,422 $ 3,853,432 $ 107,990 2.8 % The Company’s primary source of revenue is net interest income, or the difference between interest income on interest-earning assets and interest expense on interest-bearing liabilities. Included in the Company’s net interest income is interest income from municipal bonds that is almost entirely exempt from Federal income tax. These municipal bonds are classified as investments – nontaxable, and the Company may present the interest income from these bonds on a fully tax equivalent (FTE) basis.\nLoans acquired through purchase, or acquisition of other banks, are classified by the Company as Purchased Not Credit Impaired (PNCI), Purchased Credit Impaired – cash basis (PCI – cash basis), or Purchased Credit Impaired – other (PCI – other). Loans not acquired in an acquisition or otherwise “purchased” are classified as “originated”. Often, such purchased loans are purchased at a discount to face value, and part of this discount is accreted into (added to) interest income over the remaining life of the loan. A loan may also be purchased at a premium to face value, in which case, the premium is amortized into (subtracted from) interest income over the remaining life of the loan. Generally, as time goes on, the effects of loan discount accretion and loan premium amortization decrease as the purchased loans mature or pay off early. Upon the early pay off of a loan, any remaining (unaccreted) discount or (unamortized) premium is immediately taken into interest income; and as loan payoffs may vary significantly from quarter to quarter, so may the impact of discount accretion and premium amortization on interest income. Further details regarding interest income from loans, including fair value discount accretion, may be found under the heading “Supplemental Loan Interest Income Data” in the Consolidated Financial Data table at the end of this announcement.\nFollowing is a summary of the components of net interest income for the periods indicated (dollars in thousands):\nThree months ended December 31, (dollars and shares in thousands) 2017 2016 $ Change\n% Change Interest income $ 46,961 $ 44,615 $ 2,346 5.3 % Interest expense (1,868 ) (1,460 ) (408 ) 27.9 % FTE adjustment 625 619 6 1.0 % Net interest income (FTE) $\n45,718\n$ 43,774 $ 1,944 4.4 % Net interest margin (FTE) 4.26 % 4.24 % Purchased loan discount accretion: Amount (included in interest income) $ 1,489 $ 1,778 Effect on average loan yield 0.20 % 0.26 % Effect on net interest margin (FTE) 0.14 % 0.17 % Interest income recovered via loan sales: Amount (included in interest income) - $ 586 Effect on average loan yield 0.00 % 0.09 % Effect on net interest margin (FTE) 0.00 % 0.06 % The following table shows the components of net interest income and net interest margin on a fully tax-equivalent (FTE) basis for the periods indicated:\nANALYSIS OF CHANGE IN NET INTEREST MARGIN ON EARNING ASSETS (unaudited, dollars in thousands) Three Months Ended\nThree Months Ended\nThree Months Ended\nDecember 31, 2017\nSeptember 30, 2017\nDecember 31, 2016\nAverage Income/ Yield/ Average Income/ Yield/ Average Income/ Yield/ Balance Expense Rate Balance Expense Rate Balance Expense Rate Assets Earning assets Loans $ 2,948,277 $ 38,194 5.18 % $ 2,878,944 $ 37,268 5.18 % $ 2,730,391 $ 36,241 5.31 % Investments - taxable 1,118,547 7,459 2.67 % 1,114,112 7,312 2.63 % 1,031,401 7,026 2.72 % Investments - nontaxable 136,321 1,666 4.89 % 136,095 1,665 4.89 % 135,009 1,650 4.89 % Cash at Federal Reserve and other banks 86,511 267 1.23 % 85,337 292 1.37 % 233,169 317 0.54 % Total earning assets 4,289,656 47,586 4.44 % 4,214,488 46,537 4.42 % 4,129,970 45,234 4.38 % Other assets, net 369,021 357,936 353,281 Total assets $ 4,658,677 $ 4,572,424 $ 4,483,251 Liabilities and shareholders' equity Interest-bearing Demand deposits $ 964,827 210 0.09 % $ 949,348 206 0.09 % $ 892,518 94 0.04 % Savings deposits 1,380,384 430 0.12 % 1,365,249 419 0.12 % 1,389,676 439 0.13 % Time deposits 307,446 422 0.55 % 310,325 403 0.52 % 338,326 339 0.40 % Other borrowings 61,769 141 0.91 % 65,234 149 0.91 % 19,122 2 0.04 % Trust preferred securities 56,837 665 4.68 % 56,784 652 4.59 % 56,641 586 4.14 % Total interest-bearing liabilities 2,771,263 1,868 0.27 % 2,746,941 1,829 0.27 % 2,696,283 1,460 0.22 % Noninterest-bearing deposits 1,308,765 1,253,261 1,232,912 Other liabilities 65,642 64,834 72,352 Shareholders' equity 513,007 507,389 481,704 Total liabilities and shareholders' equity $ 4,658,677 $ 4,572,424 $ 4,483,251 Net interest rate spread 4.17 % 4.15 % 4.16 % Net interest income/net interest margin (FTE) 45,718 4.26 % 44,708 4.24 % 43,774 4.24 % FTE adjustment (625 ) (624 ) (619 ) Net interest income (not FTE) $ 45,093 $ 44,084 $ 43,155 Purchase loan discount accretion effect: Amount (included in interest income) $ 1,489 $ 1,364 $ 1,778 Effect on avg loan yield 0.20 % 0.19 % 0.26 % Effect on net interest margin 0.14 % 0.13 % 0.17 % Loan sale effect: Amount (included in interest income) - - $ 586 Effect on avg loan yield 0.00 % 0.00 % 0.09 % Effect on net interest margin 0.00 % 0.00 % 0.06 %\nNet interest income (FTE) during the three months ended December 31, 2017 increased $1,944,000 (4.4%) to $45,718,000 compared to $43,774,000 during the three months ended December 31, 2016. The increase in net interest income (FTE) was due primarily to increases in the average balance of loans and investments that were partially offset by an increase in other borrowings, a decrease in yield on loans, and an increase in the average rate paid on interest-bearing liabilities compared to the three months ended December 31, 2016.\nThe table below that sets forth a summary of the changes in interest income and interest expense from changes in average asset and liability balances (volume) and changes in average interest yields and rates for each category of interest earning asset and interest paying liability for the periods indicated:\nThree months ended December 31, 2017\ncompared with three months ended December 31, 2016\nVolume Yield/Rate Total Increase (decrease) in interest income: Loans $ 2,892 $ (939 ) $ 1,953 Investments - taxable 593 (160 ) 433 Investments - nontaxable 16 - 16 Federal funds sold (198 ) 148 (50 ) Total 3,303 (951 ) 2,352 Increase (decrease) in interest expense: Demand deposits (interest-bearing) 7 109 116 Savings deposits (3 ) (6 ) (9 ) Time deposits (31 ) 114 83 Other borrowings 4 135 139 Junior subordinated debt 2 77 79 Total (21 ) 429 408 Increase (decrease) in net interest income $ 3,324 $ (1,380 ) $ 1,944 The Company recorded a provision for loan losses of $1,677,000 during the three months ended December 31, 2017 compared to a reversal of provision for loan losses of $1,433,000 during the three months ended December 31, 2016. The $1,677,000 provision for loan losses during the three months ended December 31, 2017 was due primarily to an increase in nonperforming loans, and an increase in loans classified as “special mention” that were partially offset by continued low historical loan loss experience. Nonperforming loans were $24,394,000, or 0.81% of loans outstanding as of December 31, 2017, compared to $21,955,000, or 0.75% of loans outstanding as of September 30, 2017, and $20,128,000, or 0.73% of loans outstanding as of December 31, 2016. Net loan charge-offs during the three months ended December 31, 2017 were $101,000.\nThe following table presents the key components of noninterest income for the periods indicated:\nThree months ended December 31, (dollars in thousands) 2017 2016 $ Change\n% Change Service charges on deposit accounts $\n3,954 $\n3,816 $\n138 3.6 % ATM fees and interchange 4,255 4,723 (468 ) (9.9 %) Other service fees 761 752 9 1.2 % Mortgage banking service fees 515 495 20 4.0 % Change in value of mortgage servicing rights 77 14 63 450.0 % Total service charges and fees 9,562 9,800 (238 ) (2.4 %) Gain on sale of loans 816 1,392 (576 ) (41.4 %) Commission on nondeposit investment products 745 439 306 69.7 % Increase in cash value of life insurance 642 631 11 1.7 % Change in indemnification asset - (219 ) 219 (100.0 %) Gain on sale of foreclosed assets 403 44 359 815.9 % Other noninterest income 310 375 (65 ) (17.3 %) Total other noninterest income 2,916 2,662 254 9.5 % Total noninterest income $\n12,478 $ 12,462 $ 16 0.1 % Noninterest income increased $16,000 (0.1%) to $12,478,000 during the three months ended December 31, 2017 compared to the three months ended December 31, 2016. The increase in noninterest income was due primarily to a $359,000 (816%) increase in gain on sale of foreclosed assets, a $306,000 (69.7%) increase in commission on nondeposit investment products, and a $219,000 increase in change in indemnification asset that were partially offset by a $576,000 decrease in gain on sale of loans. The $359,000 increase in gain on sale of foreclosed asset was due primarily to $378,000 of previously deferred gain on sale of foreclosed assets being recorded into noninterest income as the conditions requiring its deferral were alleviated during the three months ended December 31, 2017. The $306,000 increase in commissions on nondeposit investment products was due to continued focus in this area. The $219,000 increase in change in indemnification asset was due to a $219,000 decrease in the indemnification asset during the fourth quarter of 2016, and no such change during the fourth quarter of 2017 as the Company and the FDIC terminated their loss sharing agreements during the second quarter of 2017. The $576,000 decrease in gain on sale of loans was due primarily to decreased residential mortgage refinance activity compared to the year-ago quarter.\nThe following table presents the key components of the Company’s noninterest expense for the periods indicated:\nThree months ended December 31, (dollars in thousands) 2017 2016 $ Change\n% Change Base salaries, overtime and temporary help, net of deferred loan origination costs $ 13,942 $ 14,074 $\n(132\n)\n(0.9 %) Commissions and incentives 2,247 1,864 383 20.5 % Employee benefits 4,421 4,616 (195 ) (4.2 %) Total salaries and benefits expense 20,610 20,554 56 0.3 % Occupancy 2,698 2,635 63 2.4 % Equipment 1,797 1,760 37 2.1 % Provision for losses unfunded 175 (189 ) 364 (192.6 %) Data processing and software 3,116 2,580 536 20.8 % Telecommunications 686 664 22 3.3 % ATM & POS network charges 1,399 1,076 323 30.0 % Professional fees 1,388 2,226 (838 ) (37.6 %) Advertising and marketing 928 808 120 14.9 % Postage 238 417 (179 ) (42.9 %) Courier service 283 182 101 55.5 % Intangible amortization 339 360 (21 ) (5.8 %) Operational losses 228 558 (330 ) (59.1 %) Provision for OREO losses - 100 (100 ) (100.0 %) OREO expense 114 69 45 65.2 % Assessments 424 241 183 75.9 % Merger & acquisition expense 530 - 530 Other 3,123 2,522 601 23.8 % Total other noninterest expense 17,466 16,009 1,457 9.1 % Total noninterest expense $ 38,076 $ 36,563 $ 1,513 4.1 % Average full time equivalent employees 981 1,008 (27 ) (2.7 %) Merger & acquisition expense: Professional fees $ 513 - Miscellaneous other expense 17 - Total merger & acquisition expense $ 530 $ 0 Salary and benefit expenses increased $56,000 (0.3%) to $20,610,000 during the three months ended December 31, 2017 compared to $20,554,000 during the three months ended December 31, 2016. Base salaries, net of deferred loan origination costs decreased $132,000 (0.9%) to 13,942,000. The decrease in base salaries was due primarily to annual merit increases that were more than offset by a 2.7% decrease in average full time equivalent employees to 981 from 1,008 in the year-ago quarter, and a decrease in temporary help expense. Commissions and incentive compensation increased $383,000 (20.5%) to $2,247,000 during the three months ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year-ago quarter due primarily to increases in almost every category of incentive compensation. Benefits & other compensation expense decreased $195,000 (4.2%) to $4,421,000 during the three months ended December 31, 2017 due primarily to decreases in group medical expense.\nOther noninterest expense increased $1,457,000 (9.1%) to $17,466,000 during the three months ended December 31, 2017 compared to the three months ended December 31, 2016. The increase in other noninterest expense was due primarily to $530,000 of expenses incurred in the fourth quarter of 2017 related to the proposed merger with FNBB, a $536,000 (20.8%) increase in data processing and software expense, a $323,000 increase in ATM & POS network charges, and a $364,000 increase in provision for losses for unfunded loan commitments that were partially offset by decreases of $838,000 in professional fees, and $330,000 in operational losses. The increase in data processing and software expense and ATM & POS network charges were due primarily to system enhancements and capacity expansion. The increase in change in reserve for unfunded commitments was due primarily to a larger increase in unfunded loan commitments during the three months ended December 31, 2017, compared to the three months ended December 31, 2016. The decrease in professional fees was due primarily to consulting fees incurred in the fourth quarter of 2016 related to system enhancements and capacity expansion.\nThe effective combined Federal and State income tax rate on income was 83.2% and 38.8% for the three months ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The effective combined Federal and State income tax rate was greater than the Federal statutory tax rate of 35.0% due to a Federal tax expense of $7,416,000 related to the DTA re-measurement in the fourth quarter of 2017, and State income tax expense of $1,973,000 and $2,195,000, for the three months ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively, that were partially offset by the effects of tax-exempt income of $1,041,000 and $1,031,000, respectively, from investment securities, $641,000 and $631,000, respectively, from increase in cash value of life insurance, low-income housing tax credits of ($123,000) and $62,000, respectively, and $59,000 and $0, respectively, of equity compensation excess tax benefits. The low income housing tax credits and the equity compensation excess tax benefits represent direct reductions in tax expense.\nThe provisions for income taxes applicable to income before taxes differ from amounts computed by applying the statutory Federal income tax rates to income before taxes. The effective tax rate and the statutory federal income tax rate are reconciled for the periods indicated as follows:\nThree months ended\nDecember 31,\n2017 2016 Federal statutory income tax rate 35.0 % 35.0 % State income taxes, net of federal tax benefit 7.2 7.0 Tax-exempt interest on municipal obligations (2.0 ) (1.8 ) Increase in cash value of insurance policies (1.3 ) (1.1 ) Low income housing tax credits 0.7 (0.3 ) Equity compensation (0.3 ) - Nondeductible merger expenses 0.9 - DTA re-measurement 41.6 - Other 1.4 - Effective Tax Rate 83.2 % 38.8 % The Company’s financial statements are prepared in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America (GAAP). The Company uses certain non-GAAP measures to provide supplemental information regarding performance. Net income and the effective tax rate for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2017 include the effects of $530,000 of expenses related to the proposed merger with FNBB, of which $438,000 is non-deductible for taxes, and a one-time charge of $7,416,000 due to the re-measurement of the Company’s DTA resulting from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017. Net income for the twelve months ended December 31, 2016 include the effects of $784,000 of expenses, all of which were deductible for taxes, related to the acquisition of three bank branches, including $161,231,000 of deposits, during the three months ended March 31, 2016. The Company believes that presenting the effective tax rate, net income, return on average assets (ROAA), return on average equity (ROAE), and earnings per common share, excluding the impact of merger & acquisition expenses and the re-measurement of the Company’s DTA, provides additional clarity to the users of the financial statements regarding core financial performance. The following table presents a comparison of the effective tax rate, net income, ROAA, ROAE, and earnings per common share as reported, and as adjusted for the impact of merger & acquisition expenses and the re-measurement of the Company’s DTA, for the periods indicated.\nThree months ended Year ended December 31, December 31, ($'s in thousands except per share amounts) 2017 2016 2017 2016 Income tax expense $ 14,829 $ 7,954 $ 36,958 $ 27,712 Effect of non-deductible merger expense\n(184 )\n-\n(184 )\n- Effect of income tax rate change DTA re-measurement (7,416 ) - (7,416 ) - Adjusted income tax expense\n$ 7,229 $ 7,954 $ 29,358 $ 27,712 Effective tax rate 83.2 % 38.8 % 47.7 % 38.2 % Adjusted effective tax rate 40.6 % 38.8 % 37.9 % 38.2 % Net income $ 2,989 $ 12,533 $ 40,554 $ 44,811 Effect of merger expense\n491\n-\n491\n454 Effect of income tax rate change DTA re-measurement 7,416 - 7,416 - Adjusted net income $ 10,896 $ 12,533 $ 48,462 $ 45,266 ROAA 0.26 % 1.12 % 0.89 % 1.02 % Adjusted ROAA 0.94 % 1.12 % 1.06 % 1.04 % ROAE 2.33 % 10.41 % 8.10 % 9.46 % Adjusted ROAE 8.50 % 10.41 % 9.68 % 9.55 % Earnings per common share: Basic $ 0.13 $ 0.55 $ 1.77 $ 1.96 Diluted $ 0.13 $ 0.54 $ 1.74 $ 1.94 Adjusted earnings per common share: Basic $ 0.47 $ 0.55 $ 2.12 $ 1.98 Diluted $ 0.47 $ 0.54 $ 2.08 $ 1.96 M&A expense $ 530 $ - $ 530 $ 784 Non-deductible M&A expense $ 438 $ - $ 438 $ - Average assets $ 4,658,677 $ 4,483,251 $ 4,554,505 $ 4,373,022 Average equity $ 513,007 $ 481,704 $ 500,653 $ 473,829 Weighted average shares 22,944,523 22,845,623 22,911,611 22,814,002 Weighted average diluted shares 23,289,545 23,115,708 23,249,887 23,086,460 Richard P. Smith, President and CEO of the Company commented, “The fourth quarter of 2017 was a very busy and successful quarter for the company. Lending activity across our footprint remains strong, with total loans eclipsing $3.0 billion for the first time. Total loans grew by 2.9% during the quarter, or at 11.4% annualized. Similarly, total deposits exceeded $4.0 billion during the quarter, growing $102 million or 2.6%. Just as importantly, the bank continues to be positioned well for rising rates, with demand deposits representing 34% of total deposits and the overall average cost of deposits at just 0.11%\nSmith added, “Key events for the quarter were the passing of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act and our announced acquisition of First National Bank of Northern California. While the reduction in the corporate tax rate resulted in the recognition of immediate revaluation expense against our deferred tax assets, we expect a lower corporate tax rate to have a continuing positive impact on the Company’s net income beginning in January 2018. We remain enthusiastic about our organic growth and momentum as we enter 2018, along with the completion of our previously announced strategic acquisition of First National Bank of Northern California. We continue to believe this transaction is an important element in our overall growth strategy and squarely align with our goal of being Northern California’s #1 community bank.\nThe statements contained herein that are not historical facts are forward-looking statements based on management's current expectations and beliefs concerning future developments and their potential effects on the Company.
