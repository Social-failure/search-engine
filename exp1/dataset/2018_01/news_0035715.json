Capital spending is also seen progressing healthily as corporate profitability improves and financing is inexpensive,” OP said in a statement.\nFor 2019, the bank forecast GDP growth of 2.3 percent.\n“Even though the growth is decelerating next year, this does not mean that we will have reached the peak of the cycle. Growth is faster than its anticipated long-term average and the unemployment rate will continue to fall,” the bank said.\nThe euro zone’s northernmost economy was dubbed by its former finance minister Alexander Stubb as “the sick man of Europe” in 2015. That followed a string of shocks, such as a decline of Nokia’s former phone business and recession in neighbouring Russia.\nThe latest forecasts for Finland’s GDP growth vary from 2.3 to 3.3 percent for 2018 and from 1.6 to 2.4 percent for 2019.
