Hunt, Inc. The deal is expected to close within the next three to six months.\nThe current two-story building has 25,000 square-feet of office space and a 55-car parking lot.\nFingerpaint has been a tenant in the building since it signed a ten-year lease back in October 2012. At that time, the company had 42 employees and $4.3 million in annual revenue. In 2018, the company is projecting $45 million in revenue with a staff of nearly 200, with more than half located in the Saratoga Springs location.\nThe company plans to add a third floor to the existing building to allow for further company expansion. It also has hopes to build on the existing parking lot with a mix of office, residential and parking facilities.\n\"This acquisition will ensure our long-term presence in downtown Saratoga Springs. We absolutely love our current location, and it has been a wonderful complement to all of the restaurants, bars and retail shops downtown,\" said Ed Mitzen, Fingerpaint's founder. \"We are thrilled that we will continue to be a major player in downtown Saratoga Springs for years and years to come.
