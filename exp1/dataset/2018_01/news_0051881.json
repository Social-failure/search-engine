It has a majority share in the country’s ride-hailing market with operations in more than 110 cities. \nThe company, also expanding into the food delivery business, has tied up with Microsoft Corp to build a connected car platform and is experimenting with electric vehicles. \nJapan’s SoftBank Group Corp is the biggest investor in both Ola and Uber.
