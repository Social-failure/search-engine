That deal, reached 13 years ago and valued at $250 million, expired in March 2016, according to a Tivo court filing. \nThe ITC ruled in November that Comcast’s X1 platform infringed on two Tivo patents describing a system for scheduling recordings through a smartphone app. The agency said four other Tivo patents were not infringed. \nComcast said it would remove the scheduling feature, which only a small percentage of customers used, so it could continue to offer X1 to customers while it appealed the ITC’s ruling. \nA JPMorgan analyst said in a November research note that the ruling could prompt Comcast to resolve the lawsuits through a new licensing agreement. \nSan Carlos, California-based Tivo was one of the first DVR makers but in recent years has focused on licensing its patent portfolio. \nThe patents at issue in Wednesday’s lawsuits were originally granted to Rovi Corp, a provider of digital television guides that merged with Tivo in 2016, and its Andover, Massachusetts-based subsidiary Veveo Inc.
