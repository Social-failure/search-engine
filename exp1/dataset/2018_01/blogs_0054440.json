I am as appalled as you all are,” CEO Volkmar Denner said. \nSeparately, the VDA said on Tuesday carmakers were in talks with cities including Berlin and Hamburg about ways to speed up and expand steps to tackle pollution from diesel vehicles in a bid to avoid possible bans. \nGerman Environment Minister Barbara Hendricks is meeting with European peers in Brussels to discuss government measures designed to improve air quality in badly polluted cities.
