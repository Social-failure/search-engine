However, this has prompted a backlash in popular destinations such as Barcelona, Palma de Majorca or San Sebastian as locals complain of a drop in long-term rentals and rising prices.\nThe tourism surge has raised business activity in the sector, including increased merger and acquisition interest between hotel groups and expected passenger records at Spanish airports.\nOn Wednesday, NH Hotels ( NHH.MC ) declined a takeover offer by rival Barcelo, an operation which would have created the country’s largest hotel chain, though it said it would still analyze future strategic possibilities.\nThe sector will continue to grow in the coming years due to expected economic improvement in visitors’ home countries and increased flights and destinations, the tourism association Exceltur said on Thursday.\n“Spanish tourist businesses expect a 5.6 percent growth in their income and 5.3 percent growth in their profits in 2018,” Exceltur vice-president Jose Luis Zoreda told a news conference.\nHowever, overall sector growth may ease slightly this year to 3.3 percent year-on-year from an annual expansion of 4.4 percent in 2017 due in part to many tourists returning to destinations in North Africa and Turkey, Zoreda said.\nAdditional reporting by Robert Hetz; Editing by Paul Day and Gareth Jones\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-01-11T19:47:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-11T16:55:23.007+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
