A cut in its buying of longer-dated debt earlier this week had fanned worries the BOJ may be moving to turn off its stimulus.\nBATTERED BITCOIN Bitcoin had taken a major beating overnight, falling as much as 11 percent as South Korea - one of the cryptocurrency’s biggest markets - said it was drawing up laws to ban trading in it.\nCanada’s dollar and Mexico’s peso remained firmly in the doldrums too, due to worries about the North American Free Trade Agreement which the two countries hold with the United States.\nSources in Canada’s government told Reuters on Wednesday that they were increasingly convinced Donald Trump could announce he is quitting the pact. Sources in Mexico then said it would also abandon ship if the U.S. did so.\nCommodity markets meanwhile were taking something of a breather after a flying start to the year.\nBoth Brent and U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) oil price futures were hovering just off three-year highs at just under $70 and $64 a barrel, while gold ticked over at $1,320 an ounce after spiking to nearly four-month highs.\n“In Q1, the balance of risk to Brent lies to the downside, with prices overheating, record net-length built into the futures market and fundamentals set to weaken seasonally,” BMI Research said in a note.\nMeanwhile, the NAFTA worries and nerves that China could be a target of Donald Trump’s ‘State of the Union’ address later this month sent emerging market stocks down for a third day. running.\nCurrencies were more of a mixture. South Africa’s rand fell for a second day after the new leadership of the ruling ANC said it did not discuss removing President Jacob Zuma from power, while the Thai baht hit a 3-1/2 year high.\nAdditional reporting by Henning Gloystein; Editing by Elaine Hardcastle, William Maclean\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-01-11T18:15:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-12T04:57:56.035+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
