If you are winning in a sport, you don’t change the strategy,” Hamada told Reuters in an interview on Monday. “The standard strategy is to continue with Governor Kuroda, or any person who pursues ‘Abenomics’ like him.” \n“There are many excellent people working at the BOJ and their morale will be reduced if someone outside of the central bank becomes governor so often, though I don’t know if a BOJ official will become next governor this time,” he said. \nKuroda is a former Ministry of Finance senior official.
