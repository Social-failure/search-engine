Refinery utilization rates fell by 2.1 percentage points to 90.9 percent of total capacity.\nGasoline stocks rose 3.1 million barrels, compared with analysts' expectations in a Reuters poll for a 2.5 million-barrel gain.\nDistillate stockpiles, which include diesel and heating oil, rose by 639,000 barrels, versus expectations for a 1.5 million-barrel drop, the EIA data showed.\nNet U.S. crude imports fell last week by 71,000 bpd.
