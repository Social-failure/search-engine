REUTERS/Toby Melville “Investors can play a vital role by considering the social impact of the companies they are investing in. They can use their influence to ensure these issues are taken seriously,” she will say.\nData published last week showed social media companies had accelerated removals of online hate speech in the face of a potential European Union crackdown.\nThe British government has so far met quiet resistance from tech leaders like Facebook, Google and Twitter, and critics say ending encryption will weaken security for legitimate actions and open a back door for government snooping.\nIn December, responding to a government threat to use taxes to push firms into action, Facebook said it had invested millions of pounds in people and technology to identify and remove terrorist content.\nYouTube, which is owned by Google, said in December it was doing more every day to tackle violent extremism.\nOn Thursday, May will demand a cross-industry approach to the problem, including smaller firms. She singled out messaging service Telegram as example of how small platforms “can quickly become home to criminals and terrorists”.\n“No one wants to be known as ‘the terrorists’ platform’ or the first choice app for pedophiles,” she will say.\nEditing by Stephen Addison\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-25T00:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-25T00:46:09.005+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
