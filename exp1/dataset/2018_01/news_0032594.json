The Fed is expected to maintain a similar rate hike pace for the next two years as the U.S. economy strengthens. \nHigher interest rates typically translate to more returns for banks as they can charge higher interest on loans. \nIn the latest quarter, Alabama-based Regions reported a 5.6 percent increase in net interest income. Atlanta-headquartered SunTrustâ€™s net interest income climbed 6.8 percent. \nWhile rate hikes have benefited banks, potential borrowers have stayed on the sidelines. Regions reported a fall in average loans, while SunTrust lent at the slowest rate in at least two years. \nThe banks posted higher expenses as they put out more money to cover benefits for employees. \nSeveral banks this quarter took huge charges for the new tax overhaul. Regions recorded a charge of $52 million, while SunTrust reported a gain of $172 million. \nSunTrust joined U.S. Bancorp ( USB.N ), PNC Financial ( PNC.N ) and Bank of New York Mellon Corp ( BK.N ) in booking a gain from the new tax code. \nThe sweeping tax changes, which slashed the U.S. corporate rate to 21 percent from 35 percent, is largely expected to kick-start economic growth in the U.S. and result in long-term gains. \nRegions earned 27 cents per share in the fourth quarter, while SunTrust earned $1.09 per share, excluding the tax gain and other one-time items. \nRegions earned 36 cents after adjusting for one-time items, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. \nAnalysts had expected earnings of 26 cents at Regions and $1.05 at SunTrust. \n(This story was corrected to show Regions recorded a charge of $52 million in the seventh paragraph, not Regions did not record a charge.)
