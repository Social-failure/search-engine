A Saudi Aramco employee sits in the area of its stand at the Middle East Petrotech 2016, an exhibition and conference for the refining and petrochemical industries, in Manama, Bahrain, September 27, 2016. REUTERS/Hamad I Mohammed \nThe meetings are an indication that preparations for a 2018 initial public offering, which could be the biggest IPO in history, are progressing despite market speculation it could be delayed or even shelved. \nExecutives from Citi ( C.N ), Goldman ( GS.N ) and Deutsche Bank ( DBKGn.DE ), which are all bidding to be global coordinators for the share sale, are among the teams invited to present their pitches in person, said the three sources, including two bankers who expect to attend the meetings. \nThe talks will be held at the end of January or beginning of February in the Eastern Province city of Dhahran, where the state oil company is headquartered, they added. \nTwo of the sources said the talks would involve members of the banks’ equity capital markets teams, executives who would be directly involved in an IPO, rather than top management. \nSaudi Aramco, Deutsche Bank, Citi and Goldman Sachs all declined to comment. \nThe stock market listing of the national champion is a central part of Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman’s reform drive aimed at restructuring the kingdom’s economy and reducing its dependence on oil revenue. \nThe government, which aims to float up to 5 percent of the company this year, says Aramco is worth $2 trillion - but several industry experts have questioned whether a valuation that high is realistic. \nAramco had asked the banks to present written pitches last month, according to the sources. The oil giant told bankers not to come up with a valuation, saying it had not provided enough financial information to do so, two of the sources said. \nPreparations for the IPO might be gathering speed just as the price of oil has approached $70 per barrel, the highest since mid-2015, giving Aramco a better chance to achieve its desired valuation and become the world’s most expensive company. CROWN PRINCE \nThe listing IPO-ARMO.SE is a mammoth undertaking, and any banks chosen to be global coordinators will join JPMorgan ( JPM.N ), Morgan Stanley ( MS.N ) and HSBC ( HSBA.L ), who were appointed last year. \nWith so many banks expected to share the fee pool, the advisory mandates are not viewed in the industry as particularly lucrative. But bankers see such roles as a gateway to a host of other deals they expect to flow from the kingdom’s plan to revamp its economy. \nIn another sign that plans for the IPO are moving ahead, Saudi Arabia has changed the status of Aramco to a joint-stock company as of Jan. 1, according to a cabinet decree published in the kingdom’s official bulletin last week. The change of status is a requirement for Saudi companies before they can list, a senior Aramco source told Reuters. \nHowever the final decision about if and when the listing takes place rests with Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, according to several banking sources. \nThe prince led an anti-corruption purge which saw several Saudi royals, ministers and businessmen detained late last year. It was the latest in a series of steps he had taken to assert Saudi influence internationally and amass more power for himself at home. \nAs well as the economic reforms, the daunting list of challenges undertaken by the 32-year-old since his father, King Salman, ascended the throne in 2015 include going to war in Yemen and cranking up Riyadh’s confrontation with arch-foe Iran. \n(Graphic for Aramco's stock exchange suitors, click tmsnrt.rs/2xSgSST ) Additional reporting by Dmitry Zhdannikov; Editing by Pravin Char", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-08T16:29:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-08T16:54:29.007+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
