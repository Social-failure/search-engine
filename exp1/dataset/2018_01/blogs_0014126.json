The North said its delegation would comprise athletes, high-ranking officials, a cheering squad, art performers as well as reporters and spectators. \nSouth Korea has unilaterally banned several North Korean officials from entry in response to Pyongyang's ramped-up missile and nuclear tests, held despite international pressure. \nHowever, some South Korean officials have said they see the Olympics as a possible opportunity for easing tension. \nForeign ministry spokesman Roh Kyu-deok said Seoul would consider whether it needed to take \"prior steps\", together with the U.N. Security Council and other relevant countries, to help the North Koreans visit for the Olympics. \nWorking talks will be held soon to work out the details of bringing the North Koreans to the Olympics, the statement said, with the exact schedule to be decided via documented exchanges. Family reunion \nAt Tuesday's talks, the first since December 2015, Seoul proposed inter-Korean military discussions to reduce tension on the peninsula and a reunion of family members in time for February's Lunar New Year holiday, but the joint statement made no mention of the reunions. \nThe North has finished technical work to restore a military hotline with South Korea, Seoul said, with normal communications set to resume on Wednesday. It was not immediately clear what information would be transferred along the hotline. \nThe North cut communications in February 2016, following the South's decision to shut down a jointly run industrial park in the North. \nNorth Korea also responded 'positively' to the South's proposal for athletes from both sides to march together at the Games' opening ceremony and other joint activities during the Winter Olympics, Seoul said. \nAthletes of the two sides have not paraded together at international sports events since the 2007 Asian Winter Games in China, after relations chilled under nearly a decade of conservative rule in the South. \nThe United States, which has 28,500 troops stationed in South Korea as a legacy of the 1950-1953 Korean War, initially responded coolly to the idea of inter-Korean meetings, but U.S. President Donald Trump later called them \"a good thing.\" \nTrump has said he would like to see talks go beyond the Olympics. \"At the appropriate time, we'll get involved,\" he said. \nOn Tuesday, China's foreign ministry said it was happy to see talks between North and South Korea and welcomed all positive steps. Russia echoed the sentiment, with a Kremlin spokesman saying, \"This is exactly the kind of dialogue that we said was necessary.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-09T15:21:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-09T15:41:29.009+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
