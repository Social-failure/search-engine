Now we have no choice but to defend our homeland.” Reporting by Paul Carsten in Abuja, Edward McAllister in Dakar and Josiane Kouagheu in Douala; Editing by Matthew Mpoke Bigg", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-29T21:31:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-29T22:00:59.002+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
