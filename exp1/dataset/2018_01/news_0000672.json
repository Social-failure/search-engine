He implied that other countries get to decide who can enter the lottery, which is in fact administered by the U.S. State Department. He also suggested that lottery applicants are not carefully screened, which is also inaccurate.\n\"We need to ensure that our immigration officers have the tools and resources they need,\" Trump said, adding that border patrol agents had supported Trump's presidential campaign.\nIt remains far from certain that congressional Democrats will agree to the terms that Trump outlined for a DACA deal. Early negotiations indicate that Democrats would be open to increases in border security funding but not to fundamentally changing the visa lottery program or the family migration system.\nTrump announced in September that he would cancel Obama-era DACA protections for some 800,000 young people who were brought to the United States by their parents, when they were children. At the time, the president gave Congress six months to pass legislation enshrining DACA protections into law.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-04T18:57:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-04T18:58:19.011+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
