It is also expected to include euro tranches, they added.\nA $13 billion financing would give leverage of around 7.5 times, based on the last 12-month earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization of approximately $1.7 billion for the F&R unit. Senior leverage of roughly 4.5-5.0 times could give a loan of $8 billion to $9 billion, and junior debt of $4 billion to $5 billion, sources said.\nAnother source familiar with the matter said that leverage was expected to be below 6.0 times.\nFILE PHOTO - The logo of Blackstone Group is displayed at the post where it is traded on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) April 4, 2016. REUTERS/Brendan McDermid/File Photo Although the size of the financing is challenging, liquid banks and investors are eager to lend to new buyouts as the strong level of global demand continues to exceed supply.\n“The market capacity for Europe is about 5 billion euros between loans and bonds and in the U.S. is $10 billion-$15 billion, so if there is a big deal that pushes capacity and the business has revenue globally it would make sense to have euro and dollars in loans and bonds to create a competitive dynamic in order to get best execution,” a senior banker said.\nIt is the largest LBO loan financing since 2013 when ketchup maker HJ Heinz raised a $14.1 billion financing to back its buyout by Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway and 3G Capital.\nThomson Reuters and Blackstone declined to comment.\nThomson Reuters’ board is expected to meet on Tuesday to discuss Blackstone’s offer for the F&R business, which supplies news, data and analytics to banks and investment houses around the world. The unit contributes more than half of Thomson Reuters’ annual revenues.\nUnder the terms of the Blackstone offer, Thomson Reuters would retain a 45 percent stake in the F&R business in partnership with the U.S. buyout firm.\nLoan Pricing Corp is a unit of Thomson Reuters.\nAdditional reporting by Davide Scigliuzzo in New York; Editing by Christopher Mangham and Tessa Walsh\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-30T17:41:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-30T17:55:57.002+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
