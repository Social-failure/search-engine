By 7:00 p.m., 16 cm (6.3 inches) had fallen in central Tokyo as the snowfall intensified, national broadcaster NHK said. \nTrain services were curtailed and some highways were closed, as icy roads were causing traffic accidents. Around 250 flights from Tokyo’s Haneda airport were canceled. \n“It’s really a pity the flight was canceled earlier in the day, as I’ve traveled here using paid holidays,” one woman told the NHK. “I never thought I’d see snow in Tokyo,” said another woman. \nAbout 50 cars got stuck and unable to move on the “Rainbow Bridge” on Tokyo’s waterfront. About 200 passengers were evacuated from the “Yurikamome” train carriages that were unable to go up a slope due to the snow, NHK said. \nA looming low pressure system and cold front just off the coast of Japan’s main island of Honshu was expected to bring low temperatures and more snow throughout the day and night, the Japanese Meteorological Agency said. \nThe Japanese capital, which is on roughly the same latitude as the U.S. city of Raleigh, North Carolina, often sees snow at least once a year, but this time it is expected to accumulate, rather than quickly melt as it usually does.

It showed people how to walk like penguins. \nTrains to the suburbs were packed full by the unusually early hour of 4:00 p.m. and long lines formed at supermarkets.
