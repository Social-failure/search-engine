During the fourth quarter of 2017, Key's results included a number of notable items resulting in a net impact of $.19 per common share, including merger-related charges and the estimated impact of tax reform and related actions. Notable items had a net impact of $.03 per common share in the third quarter of 2017 and $.11 per common share in the fourth quarter of 2016. Excluding notable items, earnings per common share were $.36 for the fourth quarter of 2017, compared to $.35 for the third quarter of 2017 and $.31 for the fourth quarter of 2016.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017, net income from continuing operations attributable to Key common shareholders was $1.2 billion, or $1.12 per common share, compared to $753 million, or $.80 per common share, for the same period one year ago.\n\"Key's fourth quarter results were a solid finish to the year, with continued momentum in our core businesses. Revenue trends benefited from growth in our fee-based businesses, with investment banking and debt placement fees reaching new record levels for the fourth quarter and full year. Expenses this quarter reflect the strength of our capital markets business, along with a number of notable items, including merger-related charges and the impact from recent tax reform. We expect the new tax law will benefit both Key and our clients, by strengthening the competitive position of U.S businesses and promoting stronger economic growth.\nOur full-year results reflected growth in both our Community Bank and Corporate Bank, as well as the successful integration of our First Niagara acquisition. Key's return on average tangible common equity, excluding notable items, was 13.1%, and we generated positive operating leverage for the fifth consecutive year. We have also benefited from recent investments, including the acquisition of the investment banking firm Cain Brothers, which closed early in the fourth quarter.\nOur capital position remains strong, which allowed us to complete the second increase in our common share dividend this year, along with the repurchase of $199 million in common shares during the quarter. We believe that we are well-positioned to return higher levels of capital to our shareholders.\"\n- Beth Mooney, Chairman and CEO\nEstimated Impact of Tax Reform and Related Actions\nAs a result of the recent passage of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act on December 22, 2017, Key took a number of actions, including the revaluation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, as well as certain tax-advantaged assets. This revaluation resulted in an estimated tax expense of $147 million recognized in the fourth quarter of 2017. Noninterest expense increased by $29 million in the quarter related to the impairment of certain tax-advantaged assets and an additional contribution to employee retirement accounts. The total impact of tax reform and related actions was $.16 per common share in the fourth quarter of 2017. The changes resulting from recent tax legislation are reasonable estimates as of December 31, 2017, and may be refined in future periods.\nBeginning January 1, 2018, the new tax law will lower Key's marginal federal corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21%. Key's effective tax rate will also continue to benefit from the company's investments in certain tax-advantaged assets. Key will be sharing the expected tax benefits with its employees by increasing its minimum wage and making the additional retirement plan contribution referenced above. These actions will benefit over 80% of our workforce and allow us to reward and invest in the financial wellness of our employees.\nSelected Financial Highlights\ndollars in millions, except per share data\nChange 4Q17 vs.\n4Q17\n3Q17\n4Q16\n3Q17\n4Q16\nIncome (loss) from continuing operations attributable to Key common shareholders\n$\n181\n$\n349\n$\n213\n(48.1)%\n(15.0)%\nIncome (loss) from continuing operations attributable to Key common shareholders per\ncommon share â€” assuming dilution\n.17\n.32\n.20\n(46.9)\n(15.0)\nReturn on average total assets from continuing operations\n.57%\n1.07%\n.69%\nN/A\nN/A\nCommon Equity Tier 1 ratio (a)\n10.08\n10.26\n9.54\nN/A\nN/A\nBook value at period end\n$\n13.09\n$\n13.18\n$\n12.58\n(.7)%\n4.1%\nNet interest margin (TE) from continuing operations\n3.09%\n3.15%\n3.12%\nN/A\nN/A\n(a) 12/31/2017 ratio is estimated.\nTE = Taxable Equivalent, N/A = Not Applicable\nINCOME STATEMENT HIGHLIGHTS\nRevenue\ndollars in millions\nChange 4Q17 vs.\n4Q17\n3Q17\n4Q16\n3Q17\n4Q16\nNet interest income (TE)\n$\n952\n$\n962\n$\n948\n(1.0)%\n.4%\nNoninterest income\n656\n592\n618\n10.8\n6.1\nTotal revenue\n$\n1,608\n$\n1,554\n$\n1,566\n3.5%\n2.7%\nTE = Taxable Equivalent\nTaxable-equivalent net interest income was $952 million for the fourth quarter of 2017, and the net interest margin was 3.09%, compared to taxable-equivalent net interest income of $948 million and a net interest margin of 3.12% for the fourth quarter of 2016, reflecting the benefit from higher interest rates and low deposit betas, partly offset by a shift in funding mix into certificates of deposit. Fourth quarter 2017 net interest income included $38 million of purchase accounting accretion related to the acquisition of First Niagara, a decline of $54 million from the fourth quarter of 2016, which included $34 million related to the refinement of third quarter 2016 purchase accounting estimates.\nCompared to the third quarter of 2017, taxable-equivalent net interest income declined by $10 million, and the net interest margin decreased by six basis points. The decrease in net interest income and the net interest margin reflects a decline in purchase accounting accretion of $10 million. Additionally, higher interest rates and relatively low deposit betas partially offset a decline in average loan balances, resulting from paydowns and clients continuing to take advantage of attractive capital markets alternatives in the fourth quarter of 2017.\nExcluding purchase accounting accretion, taxable-equivalent net interest income increased $58 million from the fourth quarter of 2016 and was stable compared to the third quarter of 2017.\nNoninterest Income\ndollars in millions\nChange 4Q17 vs.\n4Q17\n3Q17\n4Q16\n3Q17\n4Q16\nTrust and investment services income\n$\n131\n$\n135\n$\n123\n(3.0)%\n6.5%\nInvestment banking and debt placement fees\n200\n141\n157\n41.8\n27.4\nService charges on deposit accounts\n89\n91\n84\n(2.2)\n6.0\nOperating lease income and other ", "external_links": ["https://www.key.com/ir", "https://www.key.com/", "http://www.sec.gov/", "http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/keycorp-reports-fourth-quarter-2017-net-income-of-181-million-or-17-per-common-share-300584500.html", "https://www.key.com/newsroom", "http://www.key.com/ir"], "published": "2018-01-18T14:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-18T17:08:03.019+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
