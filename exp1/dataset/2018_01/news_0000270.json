That’s why there is only one appropriate response: Warning strikes.”\nThe Suedwestmetall employers’ lobby in Baden-Wuerttemberg, where Porsche, Daimler ( DAIGn.DE ) and components supplier Robert Bosch [ROBG.UL] are based, denounced the union’s strike plans.\n“The fact that employees are laying down their work already before the planned warning strikes on Jan. 8 is irresponsible and is placing an unnecessary burden on further talks,” Peer-Michael Dick, managing director of Suedwestmetall said by email.\nSeveral hundred workers at companies in Volkswagen’s home-state of Lower Saxony, including Bosch, laid down their tools on Tuesday in support of IG Metall’s calls for higher wages.\nReporting by Ilona Wissenbach and Andreas Cremer; Editing by Adrian Croft\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-01-03T23:49:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-03T19:25:22.090+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
