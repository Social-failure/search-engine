See footnote (1) to the Summary Financial Data table on page 16 for more information.\n(b) Tangible common equity is a non-GAAP financial measure and represents total equity less preferred equity, noncontrolling interests, and goodwill and certain identifiable intangible assets (including goodwill and intangible assets associated with certain of our nonmarketable equity investments but excluding mortgage servicing rights), net of applicable deferred taxes. The methodology of determining tangible common equity may differ among companies. Management believes that return on average tangible common equity, which utilizes tangible common equity, is a useful financial measure because it enables investors and others to assess the Company's use of equity. For additional information, including a corresponding reconciliation to GAAP financial measures, see the \"Tangible Common Equity\" tables on page 35.\n(c) The efficiency ratio is noninterest expense divided by total revenue (net interest income and noninterest income).(1) Financial information for prior quarters in 2017 has been revised to reflect the impact of the adoption in fourth quarter 2017 of Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2017-12 – Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815): Targeted Improvements to Accounting for Hedging Activities.

Over the past year we have invested billions of dollars into our business and capabilities including risk management, accelerated the pace of innovation, increased our commitment to communities, enhanced team member benefits, and continued to execute on our business strategies to provide long-term value to our shareholders. The progress we made over the past year was evident in the fourth quarter in higher deposits, loan growth particularly in commercial loans, increased debit and credit card transactions, and record client assets under management in Wealth and Investment Management. While we faced challenges in 2017, we are a much better company today than we were a year ago, and I am confident that this year Wells Fargo will be even better.”\nChief Financial Officer John Shrewsberry said, “Wells Fargo reported $6.2 billion of net income in the fourth quarter, which included a net benefit from the Tax Cuts & Jobs Act and a gain on the sale of Wells Fargo Insurance Services, partially offset by litigation accruals. Compared with the third quarter we grew both loans and deposits, and our credit performance, liquidity and capital remained exceptionally strong. We returned a record $14.5 billion to shareholders through common stock dividends and net share repurchases in 2017, up 16 percent, and returning more capital to shareholders remains a priority. We've made progress on our efficiency initiatives and remain committed to our target of $2 billion of expense reductions by the end of 2018, which are being used to support our investments in the business, and an additional $2 billion by the end of 2019. In addition, by the beginning of 2019 we expect the amortization of core deposit intangible expense ($769 million in 2018) and the FDIC special assessment to be complete.”\nNet Interest Income\nNet interest income in fourth quarter 2017 was $1", "external_links": ["http://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=https%3A%2F%2Fengage.vevent.com%2Frt%2Fwells_fargo_ao%7E6099528&esheet=51742285&newsitemid=20180112005127&lan=en-US&anchor=https%3A%2F%2Fengage.vevent.com%2Frt%2Fwells_fargo_ao%7E6099528&index=2&md5=871c8cb361af9608ffcc89a53baf9bc5", "https://engage.vevent.com/rt/wells_fargo_ao~6099528", "http://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.wellsfargo.com%2Fabout%2Finvestor-relations%2Fquarterly-earnings%2F&esheet=51742285&newsitemid=20180112005127&lan=en-US&anchor=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.wellsfargo.com%2Fabout%2Finvestor-relations%2Fquarterly-earnings%2F&index=3&md5=2be6ecdbebdac5b463a6d8d4f6899d63", "http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180112005127/en/", "http://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.wellsfargo.com%2Fabout%2Finvestor-relations%2Fquarterly-earnings%2F&esheet=51742285&newsitemid=20180112005127&lan=en-US&anchor=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.wellsfargo.com%2Fabout%2Finvestor-relations%2Fquarterly-earnings%2F&index=1&md5=abf459929a5f36fca1b7c9987045d1a0", "http://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=https%3A%2F%2Fengage.vevent.com%2Frt%2Fwells_fargo_ao%7E6099528&esheet=51742285&newsitemid=20180112005127&lan=en-US&anchor=https%3A%2F%2Fengage.vevent.com%2Frt%2Fwells_fargo_ao%7E6099528&index=4&md5=bd57e6edfd05d56b69b928217f89ff39", "https://www.wellsfargo.com/about/investor-relations/quarterly-earnings/", "http://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.sec.gov&esheet=51742285&newsitemid=20180112005127&lan=en-US&anchor=www.sec.gov&index=5&md5=86c794eca20cff3324f47eb39ddb183f"], "published": "2018-01-12T16:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-12T17:55:11.007+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
