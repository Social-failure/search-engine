But under Modi, the two sides have embraced a closer relationship based on security and economics.\nThe right-wing Netanyahu told a security conference that India and Israel were two democracies with a natural affinity, but their open and liberal societies faced risks.\n“Our way of life is being challenged, most notably, the quest for modernity, the quest for innovation (are) being challenged by radical Islam and its terrorist offshoots from a variety of corners,” he said.\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu speaks as his Indian counterpart Narendra Modi looks on during a signing of agreements ceremony at Hyderabad House in New Delhi, India January 15, 2018. REUTERS/Adnan Abidi Both Israel and India have long sought to counter militant Islamists - in Israel’s case, mainly from Gaza and Egypt’s Sinai region and, in India’s case, mainly from Pakistan. Away from the public eye, India and Israel have been cooperating against the threat through, in part, intelligence sharing, officials say.\n“We’ve discussed in this visit how we can strengthen our two nations in the civilian areas, in security areas, in every area,” Netanyahu told the conference.\nHis trip to India comes just six months after Modi made the first trip by an Indian prime minister to Israel, during which he did not go to Ramallah, seat of the self-ruling Palestinian Authority and a customary stop for leaders visiting the region.\nNetanyahu toured the Taj Mahal on Tuesday and will also visit Modi’s home state of Gujarat and India’s financial capital Mumbai.\nHe will join an 11-year-old Israeli boy, Moshe Holtzberg, whose parents were murdered by Pakistan-based militants in Mumbai in 2008, for a memorial event at the Indian financial hub’s Jewish center where the attack took place.\nThe boy, who lives with his grandparents in Israel, arrived on Tuesday as a guest of Modi.\nAdditional reporting by Neha Dasgupta; editing by Mark Heinrich\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-16T17:39:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-16T17:51:41.022+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
