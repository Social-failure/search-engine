LOUIS, Jan. 08, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Stereotaxis, Inc. (OTCQX:STXS), the global leader in innovative robotic technologies for the treatment of cardiac arrhythmias, today announced preliminary revenue results for the fourth quarter of 2017.\nPreliminary and unaudited revenue for the fourth quarter of 2017 is expected to be approximately $7.6 million, up 4% from the prior year fourth quarter. Recurring revenue generated from procedures and service contracts is expected to be $7.0 million, up 7% from the prior year fourth quarter. Recurring revenue benefited from an estimated 5% year-over-year growth in global procedures, with all major geographies contributing to the quarter’s acceleration in procedure growth. Procedures for the full year 2017 are expected to grow approximately 2% over the full year 2016, the first year of annual procedure growth since 2012.\n“We continue to see the positive early impact of our initiatives focused on ensuring electrophysiologists build successful and growing robotic ablation practices,” said David Fischel, Chairman and CEO. “I am proud of our global team’s efforts, and we expect to establish additional commercial capabilities and processes in 2018. This commercial focus is complemented by a robust effort to deliver meaningful innovation. Successful implementation of these strategies should place Stereotaxis in a position to fulfill its potential as a highly differentiated robotic technology with significant clinical benefits to patients, physicians and hospitals in the large cardiac ablation market.”\nThis week, Stereotaxis representatives will meet with the investment community in San Francisco during the J.P. Morgan Healthcare Conference and will engage with the electrophysiology community at AF Symposium in Orlando. The financial results presented in this release are preliminary and unaudited, and actual results may differ. The Company expects to report audited full year 2017 financial results in March 2018.\nAbout Stereotaxis\nStereotaxis is the global leader in innovative robotic technologies designed to enhance the treatment of arrhythmias and perform endovascular procedures.
