He was freed alongside 114 other inmates. \nThe government in Addis Ababa has long been accused by rights groups of using security concerns as an excuse to stifle dissent and media freedoms. It denies the charges. \nLast week the United Nations urged the Horn of Africa country to review the status of a “large number of people” still behind bars. \nU.N. human rights spokesman Liz Throssell said the Addis Ababa government should review anti-terror legislation and laws “to ensure that they are neither interpreted nor implemented too broadly, thereby resulting in people being arbitrarily or wrongfully detained”. \nLaws placing “undue restrictions” on non-governmental organizations and restricting the media should also be revised, Throssell told a news conference in Geneva earlier this week.
