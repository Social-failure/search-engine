Figures will be published on March 28.\n“The year 2018 has started well, charter rates are increasing and the size of the idle fleet is low,” he said.\n“We also have many new ships which have made us absolutely competitive, there is a great difference to four or five years ago,” he added.\nHabben Jansen estimated transport demand growth at 4 percent in 2017, at 4.5 percent in 2018 and more than 4 percent in 2019.\nShipping has struggled with overcapacity, price wars and freight rates far below break-even levels, but industry analysts say the worst may be over.\nThe firm’s 2017 nine-month operating profit rose more than tenfold, but it retained a net debt position of $7.3 billion, which Habben Jansen said would be tackling.\nThe company aimed to use its free cash flow in the next two years for debt reduction, he said.\nAfter merging with UASC, Hapag-Lloyd is now the world’s fifth biggest world shipping firm. Habben Jansen said he saw further consolidation in the industry.\n“Some nine of formerly 20 companies will have disappeared by the end of 2018,” he said.\nBut he said rising oil prices, now around three-year highs, were pushing up the cost of bunker fuels, presenting a challenge for shipping firms.\nReporting by Vera Eckert; Editing by Edmund Blair\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-01-18T17:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-19T12:33:19.014+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
