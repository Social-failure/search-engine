Chris Christie and his wife, Mary Pat, listen to the newly sworn-in governor, Phil Murphy, speaking after taking the oath of office Tuesday in Trenton, N.J. \nBy Kate King \nNew Jersey Democrats are gearing up to take over Trenton but face a tight budget as they look to enact far-reaching policy changes. \nPhil Murphy took the oath of office to become governor on Tuesday, ending eight years of Republican control of the top office in the Garden State. But Murphy, a former Goldman Sachs executive, faces the tricky task of implementing his progressive agenda in a state that has little money to spare. \nMurphy, 60 years old, ran on a progressive platform that included promises to fully fund the state’s public-pension payments and public schools as well as overhaul NJ Transit. He has proposed paying for these and other priorities by reinvigorating the state’s languishing economy, passing a tax on New Jersey’s millionaires and legalizing and taxing marijuana. \nBen Dworkin, director of the Rowan Institute for Public Policy and Citizenship at Rowan University in Glassboro, N.J., said it would be difficult for Murphy to implement his agenda given the state’s budget constraints. \n“A new administration wants to do something new, they need a new signature project to show how they’re different,” Dworkin said. “But even before they find the new money to do the new thing, they’ve got to fill the hole that’s been left for them.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-16T20:42:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-16T20:46:59.021+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
