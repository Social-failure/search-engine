But the former al Qaeda branch that controls the province has pledged to keep fighting Syrian government forces and their allies. \nTurkey last week launched an air and ground offensive elsewhere in northwest Syria, targeting the Kurdish YPG militia in the Afrin region. That has opened a new front in the seven-year-old, multi-sided civil war and strained ties with NATO ally Washington. \nTurkey considers the YPG a terrorist organisation and an extension of the outlawed Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK), which has waged a deadly, three-decade insurgency in Turkey’s largely Kurdish southeast. \nThe United States has armed a YPG-spearheaded militia in the fight against Islamic State in Syria.
