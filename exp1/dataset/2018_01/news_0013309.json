[...] The clause of the plan that concerns governance during the transition phase is in line with Article 50 of the Brazilian Reorganization and Bankruptcy Law, and does not violate the Brazilian Corporations Law, insofar as it seeks to confer institutional stability on the corporate bodies and administrators of entities under reorganization for purposes of compliance with the judicial reorganization plan approved with the creditors' sovereign statement. Therefore, the convening of an Extraordinary General Shareholders Meeting is absolutely unnecessary to give effect to the sovereign decision of the creditors. On the contrary, in this case, the convening of a shareholders' meeting would reinstall the instability strongly rejected by the Judiciary throughout this judicial recovery process.\"\nThe decision in its entirety is attached to this Material Fact and is also available for download on the Company's website ( www.oi.com.br/ri ), on the Empresas.NET System of the CVM ( www.cvm.gov.br ), as well as the website of B3 S.A. - Brasil, Bolsa, Balcão ( www.bmfbovespa.com.br ). The Company will furnish an English translation of the decision as soon as possible to the US Securities and Exchange Commission under cover of Form 6-K.\nFinally, Oi clarifies that, according to the approved Plan ratified by the Court, the Company will inform the shareholders, creditors and the market regarding the deadlines to be initiated upon the publication of the judicial decision that ratified the Plan.\nThe Company will keep its shareholders and the market informed of the development of the subject matter of this Material Fact.\nRio de Janeiro, January 8, 2018.\nOi S.A. – In Judicial Reorganization\nCarlos Augusto Machado Pereira de Almeida Brandão\nChief Financial Officer, Investor Relations Officer and Officer\nView original content: http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/oi-sa-ratification-of-the-judicial-reorganization-plan-300579536.html\nSOURCE Oi S.A.", "external_links": ["http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/oi-sa-ratification-of-the-judicial-reorganization-plan-300579536.html", "http://www.oi.com.br/ri", "http://www.cvm.gov.br/", "http://www.bmfbovespa.com.br/"], "published": "2018-01-09T03:48:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-09T09:41:26.740+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
