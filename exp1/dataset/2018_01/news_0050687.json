In the fourth quarter of 2017, a $752 thousand, or $0.16 per diluted share, charge to income tax expense was recorded related to the re-measurement of net deferred tax assets resulting from the new 21% federal corporate income tax rate established by the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act enacted in December 2017.\n2017 Key Accomplishments:\nRecord year of revenues totaling $33.6 million Pre-tax income increased 23% Return on equity of 11.57% Loan growth of $36.1 million, or 8% Asset quality continued to be stable Efficiency ratio improved for second consecutive year to 66.42% Expanded into Richmond with branch and experienced bankers\n“Last year was an incredible year for our company,” said Scott Harvard, president and chief executive officer of First National. Harvard added, “In spite of a surprise tax adjustment at year end, we were able to grow earnings per share by eight percent while also absorbing the expense of opening a new branch in Richmond. The efficiency ratio improved for the second straight year. We continue to believe that efficiency is a strong driver of shareholder value and are pleased with the direction of our efficiency ratio and our stock price over the last two years. I am extremely proud of our team's hard work during the year and their continued focus on customer service, community involvement, and expense management.”\nBALANCE SHEET\nTotal assets of First National increased $23.1 million to $739.1 million at December 31, 2017, compared to one year ago. Loans, net of the allowance for loan losses, increased $36.1 million, or 8%. The composition of the balance sheet changed when comparing the periods. Average loans, the highest yielding asset class, increased as the percentage of total average earning assets to 74% from 71%.\nTotal deposits increased $19.4 million, or 3%, to $665.0 million, compared to $645.6 million at December 31, 2016. When comparing the composition of the deposit portfolio at December 31, 2017 to one year ago, noninterest-bearing deposits increased $12.8 million, from 26% to 27% of total deposits, savings and interest-bearing demand deposits increased $12.4 million, remaining at 54% of total deposits, while time deposits decreased $5.8 million, from 20% to 19% of total average deposits.\nShareholders’ equity increased $6.0 million to $58.2 million at December 31, 2017, compared to $52.2 million one year ago, primarily from an increase in retained earnings. Tangible common equity totaled $57.2 million at the end of the year, compared to $50.6 million at December 31, 2016. The Company’s wholly-owned banking subsidiary, First Bank, was considered well-capitalized based on regulatory requirements at the end of the year.\nANALYSIS OF THE THREE MONTH PERIOD\nNet interest income increased $692 thousand, or 12%, to $6.6 million for the quarter ended December 31, 2017, compared to $5.9 million for the fourth quarter of 2016. The increase resulted from a higher net interest margin and higher average earning asset balances. Average earning asset balances increased 4%, and the net interest margin increased 26 basis points to 3.86% for the quarter ended December 31, 2017, compared to 3.60% for the same period in 2016. The increase in the net interest margin resulted from a 33 basis point increase in the yield on total earning assets, which was partially offset by a 7 basis point increase in interest expense as a percent of average earning assets.\nThe higher yield on earning assets was attributable to an increase in yields on loans, securities and interest-bearing deposits in banks, as well as a change in the composition of earning assets. Yields increased on loans, securities, and interest-bearing deposits in banks by 21 basis points, 17 basis points and 69 basis points, respectively. A change in the asset composition also favorably impacted the earning asset yield as average loan balances increased to 75% of average earning assets for the quarter ended December 31, 2017, compared to 72% of average earning assets for the same period in 2016.\nThe increase in interest expense was attributable to higher interest rates paid on deposits, as the cost of total interest-bearing deposits increased by 10 basis points to 0.40%. The increase in deposit costs compared favorably to increases of 75 basis points in the target federal funds rate during 2017. Interest expense also increased from an $8.4 million increase in average total interest-bearing deposits, when comparing the periods.\nNoninterest income increased to $2.4 million, compared to $2.1 million for the same period of 2016. This was primarily a result of a $305 thousand increase in other operating income and a $33 thousand increase in wealth management revenue. The increase in other operating income was attributable to a $305 thousand life insurance benefit recorded during the fourth quarter of 2017. These increases were partially offset by net losses on sales of securities totaling $114 thousand and a $99 thousand decrease in service charges on deposits.\nNoninterest expense increased $386 thousand, or 7%, to $6.0 million for the fourth quarter, compared to the same period one year ago. This was attributable to a $441 thousand, or 15%, increase in salaries and employee benefits, a $26 thousand increase in equipment expense, and a $24 thousand increase in occupancy expense. These expenses increased primarily from the expansion of the Company's banking subsidiary, First Bank, into the Richmond, Virginia market during the fourth quarter. The Bank also incurred a $252 thousand loss from the decision to sell a former bank branch located in Woodstock, Virginia during the quarter. The increases in expenses were partially offset by a $192 thousand increase in other real estate owned income, a $50 thousand decrease in supplies expense, a $42 thousand decrease in postage expense, and a $39 thousand decrease in amortization expense. The increase in other real estate owned income resulted from the sale of a former bank branch in Winchester, Virginia during the quarter.\nIncome tax expense increased $799 thousand to $1.5 million for the fourth quarter, compared to $724 thousand for the same period of 2016. The increase was primarily attributable to a $752 thousand charge to income tax expense that was recorded for the re-measurement of net deferred tax assets, which resulted from the new 21% federal corporate income tax rate established by the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act enacted in December 2017.\nANALYSIS OF THE TWELVE MONTH PERIOD\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017, net interest income increased $2.0 million, or 9%, to $25.3 million, compared to $23.3 million for the same period in 2016. The increase resulted from a higher net interest margin and higher average earning asset balances. Average earning asset balances increased 4%, and the net interest margin increased 16 basis points to 3.77% for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to 3.61% for the same period in 2016. The increase in the net interest margin resulted from a 21 basis point increase in the yield on total earning assets, which was partially offset by a 5 basis point increase in interest expense as a percent of average earning assets.\nThe higher yield on earning assets was attributable to an increase in yields on loans, securities and interest-bearing deposits in banks, as well as a change in the composition of earning assets. Yields increased on loans, securities, and interest-bearing deposits in banks by 8 basis points, 15 basis points and 43 basis points, respectively. A change in the asset composition also favorably impacted the earning asset yield, as average loan balances increased to 74% of average earning assets for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to 71% of average earning assets for the same period in 2016.\nThe increase in interest expense was attributable to higher interest rates paid on deposits, as the cost of total interest-bearing deposits increased by 7 basis points to 0.36%. The increase in deposit costs compared favorably to increases of 75 basis points in the target federal funds rate during the year. Interest expense also increased from a $7.6 million increase in average total interest-bearing deposits, when comparing the periods.\nNoninterest income totaled $8.3 million, compared to $8.5 million for the same period of 2016. This was primarily a result of a $484 thousand decrease in service charges on deposits and net losses on sales of securities totaling $90 thousand during 2017. Service charges on deposits decreased from lower overdraft revenue. These decreases were partially offset by a $194 thousand increase in other operating revenue, which resulted from a life insurance benefit recorded during the fourth quarter, and an $85 thousand increase in wealth management revenue.\nNoninterest expense decreased $204 thousand, or 1%, to $23.3 million. Amortization expense decreased $151 thousand, FDIC assessment decreased $110 thousand, supplies decreased $85 thousand, other real estate income increased $66 thousand, ATM and check card fees decreased $61 thousand, and occupancy decreased $51 thousand. These favorable variances were partially offset by a net loss on disposal of premises and equipment that totaled $252 thousand and a $64 thousand increase in bank franchise tax. The net loss on disposal of premises and equipment resulted from the decision to sell a former bank branch located in Woodstock, Virginia during the fourth quarter.\nIncome tax expense increased $1.4 million to $3.7 million for the year, compared to $2.4 million for the same period of 2016. The increase included a $752 thousand charge to income tax expense during the fourth quarter of 2017 that was recorded related to the re-measurement of net deferred tax assets, which resulted from the new 21% federal corporate income tax rate established by the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act enacted in December 2017.\nASSET QUALITY/LOAN LOSS PROVISION\nThe provision for loan losses totaled $100 thousand for the fourth quarter and year ended December 31, 2017. There was no provision for loan losses recorded during 2016. Net charge-offs totaled $75 thousand for the quarter and $95 thousand for the year ended December 31, 2017. Nonperforming assets totaled $1.3 million, or 0.17% of total assets at year-end, compared to $1.8 million, or 0.25% of total assets, one year ago. The allowance for loan losses totaled $5.3 million at December 31, 2017 and 2016, representing 1.02% and 1.09% of total loans, respectively.\nFORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS\nCertain information contained in this discussion may include “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.

income $ 372 $ 391 Total tax-equivalent net interest income $ 25,638 $ 23,646 (1) The efficiency ratio is computed by dividing noninterest expense excluding other real estate owned income/expense, amortization of intangibles, and gains and losses on disposal of premises and equipment by the sum of net interest income on a tax-equivalent basis and noninterest income, excluding gains and losses on sales of securities. Tax-equivalent net interest income is calculated by adding the tax benefit realized from interest income that is nontaxable to total interest income then subtracting total interest expense. The tax rate utilized in calculating the tax benefit is 34%. See the tables above for tax-equivalent net interest income and reconciliations of net interest income to tax-equivalent net interest income. The efficiency ratio is a non-GAAP financial measure that management believes provides investors with important information regarding operational efficiency. Such information is not prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) and should not be construed as such. Management believes, however, such financial information is meaningful to the reader in understanding operational performance, but cautions that such information not be viewed as a substitute for GAAP.\n(2) All capital ratios reported are for First Bank.\nSource:First National Corporation", "external_links": ["https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=EGqCvrhpfoIlfhkTWzn4ff_S2WEiVQi4yIPYiMpCFNerwhL9SmQZmZiXl1RjizCLgqZileenF1n7m-9FH9n-cKzqeq91pPgT98aq-wCzDWU=", "https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=qmgEhRDqavBw8CyMDkq6bvT60kN840cb9dw1wECk4e3k6q2Me4fUVFvf0IQnvxcF5uWi7FGuAGhRLH0XLSfVUWbjlbaTKfu__QuBGb4g4RQ=", "https://www.globenewswire.com/NewsRoom/AttachmentNg/2bbb2867-2ccc-46f0-b18a-a8e7d8a42941"], "published": "2018-01-30T15:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-30T15:20:06.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
