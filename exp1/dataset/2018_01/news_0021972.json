Shooting guard Tyler Johnson, who had been bothered by a neck injury, also started and contributed 14 points and six rebounds.\nIn addition, forward Justise Winslow returned after missing 14 games due to an injury to his left knee. He had three points, four rebounds and four assists in 13 minutes off the bench.\nMiami’s other double-figure scorer was small forward Josh Richardson, who had 16 points.\nThe Bucks, who are just 3-5 in their past eight games, were led by 6-foot-11 forward Giannis Antetokounmpo, who entered Sunday ranked second in the NBA with a 28.5 scoring average. Against Miami, he was held to 22 points and six rebounds.\nMilwaukee also got 16 points from forward Khris Middleton and 15 points from guard Malcolm Brogdon.\nThe Bucks got off to a 6-0 start and led by as many as eight points in the first quarter. But, after a Heat rally, the Bucks ended the quarter with a slim 23-21 lead.\nThere was a similar pattern in the second quarter, as Miami closed with an 8-2 run, cutting Milwaukee’s lead to 43-41 at halftime.\nMiami used a 14-0 run to break the game, taking a 71-59 lead after three quarters, and the Heat coasted through much of the final period.\n--Field Level Media\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-01-15T04:53:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-15T16:51:51.007+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
