The oil giant told bankers not to come up with a valuation, saying it had not provided enough financial information to do so, two of the sources said.\nPreparations for the IPO might be gathering speed just as the price of oil has approached $70 per barrel, the highest since mid-2015, giving Aramco a better chance to achieve its desired valuation and become the world’s most expensive company.\nCROWN PRINCE The listing IPO-ARMO.SE is a mammoth undertaking, and any banks chosen to be global coordinators will join JPMorgan ( JPM.N ), Morgan Stanley ( MS.N ) and HSBC ( HSBA.L ), who were appointed last year.\nWith so many banks expected to share the fee pool, the advisory mandates are not viewed in the industry as particularly lucrative. But bankers see such roles as a gateway to a host of other deals they expect to flow from the kingdom’s plan to revamp its economy.\nIn another sign that plans for the IPO are moving ahead, Saudi Arabia has changed the status of Aramco to a joint-stock company as of Jan. 1, according to a cabinet decree published in the kingdom’s official bulletin last week. The change of status is a requirement for Saudi companies before they can list, a senior Aramco source told Reuters.\nHowever the final decision about if and when the listing takes place rests with Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, according to several banking sources.\nThe prince led an anti-corruption purge which saw several Saudi royals, ministers and businessmen detained late last year. It was the latest in a series of steps he had taken to assert Saudi influence internationally and amass more power for himself at home.\nAs well as the economic reforms, the daunting list of challenges undertaken by the 32-year-old since his father, King Salman, ascended the throne in 2015 include going to war in Yemen and cranking up Riyadh’s confrontation with arch-foe Iran.\nAdditional reporting by Dmitry Zhdannikov; Editing by Pravin Char\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-08T16:24:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-08T16:32:56.076+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
