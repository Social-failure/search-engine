When they joined, we motivated and encouraged them. I used to be discouraged too and I didn’t see much hope for my life, but things have changed. I might be crippled, but I can still do whatever I dream of,” said 28-year-old basketball player Salah Al Haj, who has been paralyzed since childhood.\nLike him, many of the players have pursued careers in teaching, administration and even politics.\nROADSIDE REFUGEE South Sudan’s wheelchair basketball found its origins in Kakuma refugee camp in Kenya a decade ago, when Kenny Nyambura, who worked in the camp, became increasingly fed up.\n“Whenever I went outside, I saw people with disabilities sit by the roadside. They were visibly discouraged and didn’t do anything. I needed to tell them that they were important and had a lot to contribute. I knew about wheelchair basketball and thought it might be a solution. That’s how the idea was born,” Nyambura told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.\nHe has been coaching the team ever since.\n“We now have 30 members in South Sudan’s wheelchair basketball association and they meet for practice every week,” said Christine Lund, physical rehabilitation program manager for the International Committee of the Red Cross(ICRC).\n”The team was supplied with special sports chairs with angled wheels and a secured footrest,” said Lund.\nWhile the players enjoy their game – loud laughter can be heard outside the stadium – it’s mainly a supportive community and a vital get-together every week that gives a sense of purpose.\n“I didn’t know many people who could relate to my situation, even though I had an amputated leg for the past 16 years,” said Beny Kim, 31. “The group accepts me. I can share my struggles when I need to, and I can also have fun and laugh with my friends.”\nDisability has glued together a multi-ethnic team in a country that has been home to an ethnically driven war.\nDEAF DANCERS On the other side of the capital of Juba, six young women meet regularly to practice choreographed dances, getting ready for the many performances they have scheduled around town.\nNone of them can hear.\nRun by the South Sudan Women with Disabilities Network, the dancers were asked to join the team in their own backyards.\n“A few women went from house to house to find people with disabilities. That’s how they found me,” Josephine Kidene explained in sign language.\nAged 21, she is the team leader.\n“We practice and perform traditional cultural dances. None of us can hear the music, but we feel the vibration and can dance to the beat,” said Kidene, surrounded by her fellow dancers, all of them smiling and giggling.\nThey seem confident and full of energy.\nBut Caroline Atim, the network’s director – who is also deaf – knows first hand the challenges they all face in life.\n“There was a lot of discrimination, stigma and violence against disabled women,” she told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.\n“Over the years, I’ve seen the women become more confident. They understand their challenges, but also embrace their difference. It makes me very proud,” she explained through an interpreter\nDifficulties abound in the war-torn country, where disability is not in the spotlight and most initiatives are only rolled out in the capital.\n“Decades of civil war have increased the number of people with disabilities,” said Human Rights Watch’s disability rights director Shantha Rau Barriga.\n“People with disabilities and older people are often left behind during attacks and find themselves at much greater risk of starvation or abuse,” Barriga added.\nAnd with sustained fighting, leg amputations due to gunshot wounds and landmines are still occurring.\n“Change is happening on an individual basis,” coach Nyambura explained. “South Sudan is a tough place, but seeing my team’s excitement and joy makes my job worth it.”\nEditing by Lyndsay Griffiths.
