The source said that the motorcyclist however dropped one satchel of loot after hitting a pedestrian in a melee fleeing the scene. \nThe getaway car was found about 20 kms (12 miles) north of Paris in an area where the three arrested came from, the source said. \nOfficials were still determining the value of the haul since some jewels and watches had been recovered on those arrested. \nA figure of 4.5 million euros (£4 million), announced earlier, related to the total value of the jewellery in the display cases.

Over the last few years police have kept a permanent presence in the area, but that has not deterred potential robbers. \nIn December, a man was able to substitute two diamonds and two rings worth 5.5 million euros in a jewellery store replacing them with fakes. \nIn October 2016, reality television celebrity Kim Kardashian was the victim of a robbery just 10 minutes walk from the Ritz, in which millions of dollars’ worth of jewellery was stolen from her.
