The four others have returned to Hong Kong.\nChinese authorities said Gui was freed in October after serving a two-year sentence for a traffic offense in 2003.\nSweden’s Foreign Ministry has twice summoned China’s ambassador to Stockholm to explain the situation after he was taken.\nHis daughter, Angela Gui, says he was taken off a train by plainclothes police while en route to the capital to get medical attention for a neurological ailment.\nChina’s Ministry of Public Security has not responded to a request for comment on the incident and it has not been possible to reach the Ministry of State Security, which has no website and does not have a publicly available telephone number.\n“If a Swedish citizen can be abducted and held incommunicado without consequences, then it could happen to any EU citizen,” said a European diplomat.\nAdditional reporting by Ben Blanchard and Michael Martina; Editing by Paul Tait\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-24T06:28:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-24T07:10:04.022+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
