That still outnumbered homicides in the two largest U.S. cities, New York and Los Angeles, combined.\nReporting by Umberto Bacchi @UmbertoBacchi, Editing by Katy Migiro.; Please credit the Thomson Reuters Foundation, the charitable arm of Thomson Reuters, that covers humanitarian news, women's rights, trafficking, property rights, climate change and resilience.
