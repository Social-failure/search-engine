However, regulators have been tightening controls on the fast-growing 3.5 billion pound spreadbetting industry. \nPlus500 said its “broad offering” allows customers to participate in the volatility of multiple crypto currencies, without owning the underlying asset. \n“Plus500 remains focused on risk management which includes setting appropriate risk and leverage for all the instruments traded on its platform,” it said. \nShares in leading British spreadbetting firms sank last month after the European Union’s securities watchdog said it may curb core parts of their market under sweeping new powers from January. \nAdditionally, Britain's markets watchdog said it had noticed steady growth in the volume of CFDs linked to digital currencies. The Financial Conduct Authority said it supported the ESMA in its consideration of potential EU-wide product intervention.
