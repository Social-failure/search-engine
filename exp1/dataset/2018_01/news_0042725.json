Net income for the year ended December 31, 2016 was $232.7 million or $3.53 per diluted share.\nNet income for fourth quarter of 2017 totaled $72.5 million or $1.11 per diluted share compared to $85.6 million or $1.31 per diluted share for the third quarter of 2017 and $50.0 million or $0.76 per diluted share for the fourth quarter of 2016.\nThe Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (\"the Act\") signed into law on December 22, 2017 resulted in an $11.7 million or $0.18 per share reduction in net income for the fourth quarter. A decrease in the federal corporate tax rate from 35% to 21% required us to revalue deferred tax assets and liabilities. Provisions of the Act also limit the deductibility of certain other expenses.\nSteven G. Bradshaw, president and chief executive officer, stated, “The fourth quarter wrapped up a very strong year for BOK Financial, in which we delivered our strongest earnings performance in the past five years. While we benefited from a healthy interest rate environment, the key to earnings leverage was maintaining expense discipline throughout the year. In addition, the benign credit environment combined with our strong underwriting minimized credit costs during the year. Finally, our wealth management business delivered record financial results in 2017 and surpassed $80 billion of assets under management and administration for the first time in company history, leading our diverse set of fee based businesses.”\nBradshaw continued, “Now that we have clarity on tax reform and healthcare, we believe the stage is set for stronger loan growth in 2018. In the fourth quarter our healthcare business grew at its strongest pace in over a year, and we are already seeing an increase in client loan demand in our commercial and industrial business. In addition, energy banking continues to benefit from the company’s long-term commitment to our energy borrowers, and our private banking division remains among our fastest-growing lending segments.”\n“The write-down of our deferred tax asset was necessitated by expected lower future tax rates and negatively impacted fourth quarter earnings. However, we believe the passage of tax reform will be beneficial to economic growth across our footprint, drive increased loan demand in many of our businesses, and provide a material benefit to future profitability,” Bradshaw concluded.\nFourth Quarter 2017 Highlights\nNet interest revenue totaled $216.9 million for the fourth quarter of 2017, compared to $218.5 million for the third quarter of 2017. Net interest margin was 2.97 percent, compared to 3.01 percent in the third quarter of 2017. Recoveries of foregone interest on nonaccruing loans added $4.7 million and 6 basis points to net interest margin in the third quarter. Average earning assets increased $122 million over the prior quarter.\nFees and commissions revenue totaled $168.2 million for the fourth quarter of 2017, compared to $173.5 million for the third quarter of 2017. Transaction card revenue decreased $3.3 million and other revenue decreased $1.9 million. Fiduciary and asset management revenue grew $1.1 million.\nOperating expense was $264.0 million for the fourth quarter, a $1.9 million decrease compared to the prior quarter. Personnel costs decreased $2.6 million, partially offset by a $634 thousand increase in non-personnel expense.\nThe Company recorded a $7.0 million negative provision for credit losses in the fourth quarter, due to continued improvement in credit metric trends. No provision for credit losses was recorded in the third quarter of 2017. The company had net charge-offs of $11.7 million or 27 basis points of average loans on an annualized basis in the fourth quarter of 2017, compared to net charge-offs of $3.4 million or 8 basis points of average loans on annualized basis in the third quarter. For the full year, net charge-offs were $16.0 million or 9 basis points of average loans in 2017 and $34.8 million or 21 basis points of average loans in 2016.\nThe combined allowance for credit losses totaled $234 million or 1.37 percent of outstanding loans at December 31, 2017, compared to $253 million or 1.47 percent of outstanding loans at September 30, 2017.\nNonperforming assets that are not guaranteed by U.S. government agencies totaled $207 million or 1.22 percent of outstanding loans and repossessed assets at December 31, 2017 compared to $249 million or 1.46 percent of outstanding loans and repossessed assets at September 30, 2017. The decrease in nonperforming assets was primarily due to nonaccruing energy, other commercial and industrial and healthcare sector loans.\nAverage loan balances were largely unchanged compared to the previous quarter. Growth in residential mortgage and personal loans was offset by decreased commercial and commercial real estate loan balances. Period-end outstanding loan balances were $17.2 billion at December 31, 2017, a $53 million decrease compared to September 30, 2017.\nAverage deposits were largely unchanged compared to the previous quarter. Growth in interest-bearing transaction and demand deposit account balances was partially offset by a decrease in time deposits. Period end deposits increased $213 million over September 30, 2017 to $22.1 billion at December 31, 2017.\nThe common equity Tier 1 capital ratio was 11.95 percent at December 31, 2017. In addition, the Company's Tier 1 capital ratio was 11.95 percent, total capital ratio was 13.43 percent and leverage ratio was 9.31 percent. At September 30, 2017, the common equity Tier 1 capital ratio was 11.90 percent, the Tier 1 capital ratio was 11.90 percent, total capital ratio was 13.47 percent and leverage ratio was 9.30 percent.\nThe company repurchased 80,000 common shares at an average price of $92.54 per share during the fourth quarter of 2017. No shares were repurchased during the third quarter of 2017.\nTax Cuts and Jobs Act\nFourth quarter and full year 2017 earnings included an $11.7 million or $0.18 per diluted share charge as a result of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act which was signed into law on December 22, 2017. The write-down of net deferred tax assets from a federal and state statutory tax rate of 38.9 percent to 25.5 percent totaled $9.5 million, including $6.4 million of deferred tax assets related to unrealized losses on available for sale securities. In addition, the charge included $2.2 million to write-off deferred tax assets related to the compensation of certain executive officers that will no longer be deductible.\nWe currently expect that the federal and state effective tax rate for 2018 will be between 22 percent and 23 percent, compared to 33.8 percent for 2017, excluding the tax effects of equity compensation arrangements and similar discrete items.\nNet Interest Revenue\nNet interest revenue was $216.9 million for the fourth quarter of 2017, a decrease of $1.6 million compared to the third quarter of 2017.\nNet interest margin was 2.97 percent for the fourth quarter of 2017, compared to 3.01 percent for the third quarter of 2017. Recoveries of foregone interest primarily related to nonaccruing energy loans added $4.7 million to net interest revenue and 6 basis points to net interest margin for the third quarter. Excluding the impact of interest recoveries in the third quarter, the yield on average earning assets was 3.49 percent, a 5 basis point increase over the prior quarter and the yield on the loan portfolio increased 9 basis points to 4.29 percent. The yield on the available for sale securities portfolio increased 4 basis points to 2.21 percent. Funding costs were 0.79 percent, up 4 basis points. The cost of interest-bearing deposits increased 3 basis points to 0.48 percent as market pricing pressure remained relatively subdued. The cost of other borrowed funds was up 5 basis points to 1.28 percent.\nAverage earning assets increased $122 million during the fourth quarter of 2017. Fair value option securities held as an economic hedge of our mortgage servicing rights increased $108 million. Average trading securities balances increased $69 million. This growth was partially offset by a $76 million decrease in average loan balances primarily due to lower commercial and commercial real estate balances, partially offset by growth in residential mortgage and personal loans. Average interest-bearing deposits increased $14 million over the third quarter of 2017. The average balance of borrowed funds increased $124 million.\nFees and Commissions Revenue\nFees and commissions revenue totaled $168.2 million for the fourth quarter of 2017, a $5.3 million decrease compared to the third quarter of 2017.\nFiduciary and asset management revenue grew $1.1 million or 3 percent over the third quarter of 2017. Total assets under management or in custody totaled $81.8 billion, up 5 percent since September 30 due to a combination of net cash inflows and higher asset valuation.\nMortgage banking revenue totaled $24.4 million, unchanged from the previous quarter. Production volume was down 9 percent from the previous quarter due primarily to the effect of higher interest rates. The impact of decreased production volume on revenue was offset by improved pricing margin.\nTransaction card revenue decreased $3.3 million compared to the third quarter of 2017 primarily due to a customer early termination fee received in the third quarter. Additionally, other revenue decreased $1.9 million primarily as a result of the sale of a consolidated merchant banking investment. Other expense also decreased as a result of the sale.\nOperating Expenses\nTotal operating expenses were $264.0 million for the fourth quarter of 2017, a decrease of $1.9 million compared to the third quarter of 2017.\nPersonnel costs decreased $2.6 million compared to the previous quarter. Employee benefits expense decreased $1.8 million primarily due to lower pension costs. Regular salary expense decreased $798 thousand while incentive compensation expense remained relatively flat.\nNon-personnel expense increased $634 thousand over the third quarter of 2017. Professional fees increased $3.1 million primarily due to project costs related to the new online account opening product. The fourth quarter also included a $2.0 million contribution to the BOKF Foundation. Net losses and operating expenses of repossessed assets decreased $5.7 million. A $4.7 million write-down of a set of oil and gas properties was recognized in the third quarter.\nLoans, Deposits and Capital\nLoans\nOutstanding loans were $17.2 billion at December 31, 2017, a $53 million decrease compared to September 30. Decreased commercial and commercial real estate loan balances were partially offset by growth in residential mortgage and personal loans.\nOutstanding commercial loan balances decreased $62 million compared to September 30, 2017. Wholesale/retail sector loan balances decreased $187 million and manufacturing sector loan balances decreased $23 million. Healthcare sector loans grew by $75 million over the prior quarter and energy sector loans were up $62 million over September 30, 2017.\nUnfunded energy loan commitments grew by $182 million in the fourth quarter to $2.9 billion. All other unfunded commercial loan commitments totaled $4.8 billion at December 31, 2017, largely unchanged compared to September 30, 2017.\nCommercial real estate loans decreased by $38 million compared to September 30, 2017 due primarily to continued pay-down activity as borrowers took advantage of favorable long-term rates and refinanced into the permanent market. Retail sector loans decreased by $34 million, multifamily residential loans decreased by $19 million and loans secured by industrial facilities decreased by $18 million. Loans secured by office buildings increased $35 million. Unfunded commercial real estate loan commitments totaled $1.2 billion at December 31, 2017, a $112 million increase over September 30, 2017.\nResidential mortgage loans grew by $28 million and personal loans were up $19 million over the prior quarter.\nDeposits\nPeriod-end deposits totaled $22.1 billion at December 31, 2017, a $213 million increase over September 30, 2017.

Among the lines of business, Commercial Banking deposits increased $220 million and Wealth Management deposits increased $163 million, partially offset by a $147 million decrease in Consumer Banking deposits.\nCapital\nThe company's common equity Tier 1 capital ratio was 11.95 percent at December 31, 2017. In addition, the Company's Tier 1 capital ratio was 11.95 percent, total capital ratio was 13.43 percent and leverage ratio was 9.31 percent at December 31, 2017.

The tangible common equity ratio is primarily based on total shareholders' equity, which includes unrealized gains and losses on available for sale securities. The Company has elected to exclude unrealized gains and losses from available for sale securities from its calculation of Tier 1 capital for regulatory capital purposes.\nCredit Quality\nNonperforming assets totaled $290 million or 1.69 percent of outstanding loans and repossessed assets at December 31, 2017, down from $328 million or 1.90 percent of outstanding loans and repossessed assets at September 30, 2017. Nonperforming assets that are not guaranteed by U.S. government agencies totaled $207 million or 1.22 percent of outstanding loans and repossessed assets (excluding those guaranteed by U.S. government agencies) at December 31, 2017 and $249 million or 1.46 percent at September 30, 2017.\nNonaccruing loans totaled $188 million or 1.10 percent of outstanding loans at December 31, 2017, compared to $226 million or 1.31 percent of outstanding loans at September 30, 2017. New nonaccruing loans identified in the fourth quarter totaled $33 million, offset by $53 million in payments received, $14.7 million in charge-offs and $1.9 million in foreclosures and repossessions. At December 31, 2017, nonaccruing commercial loans totaled $137 million or 1.28 percent of outstanding commercial loans. Nonaccruing commercial real estate loans were only $2.9 million or 0.08 percent of outstanding commercial real estate loans. Nonaccruing residential mortgage loans not guaranteed by U.S. government agencies totaled $38 million or 2.15 percent of outstanding residential mortgage loans.\nAt December 31, 2017, approximately $51 million of nonaccruing loans required a specific allowance of $8.8 million. No specific allowance was necessary for the remaining $137 million of nonaccruing loans based on estimated cash flows or collateral value. At September 30, 2017, $90 million of nonaccruing loans required a specific allowance of $13 million and no specific allowance was necessary on the remaining $136 million of nonaccruing loans.\nPotential problem loans, which are defined as performing loans that, based on known information, cause management concern as to the borrowers' ability to continue to perform, decreased to $241 million at December 31, 2017 from $285 million at September 30, 2017. This decrease largely resulted from energy loans, partially offset by an increase in services and healthcare sector loans.\nThe company had net charge-offs of $11.7 million or 27 basis points of average loans on an annualized basis for the fourth quarter of 2017, compared to net charge-offs of $3.4 million or 8 basis points of average loans on annualized basis for the third quarter of 2017. Gross charge-offs totaled $14.7 million for the fourth quarter, compared to $5.8 million for the previous quarter. Recoveries totaled $3.1 million for the fourth quarter of 2017 and $2.4 million for the third quarter of 2017.\nAfter evaluating all credit factors, including continued improvement in nonaccruing and potential problem loans, the company determined that a $7.0 million negative provision for credit losses was appropriate during the fourth quarter of 2017. No provision for credit losses was recorded in the third quarter of 2017.\nThe combined allowance for credit losses totaled $234 million or 1.37 percent of outstanding loans and 131 percent of nonaccruing loans, excluding loans guaranteed by U.S. government agencies, at December 31, 2017. The allowance for loan losses was $231 million and the accrual for off-balance sheet credit losses was $3.7 million. At September 30, 2017, the combined allowance for credit losses was $253 million or 1.47 percent of outstanding loans and 117 percent of nonaccruing loans, excluding loans guaranteed by U.S. government agencies. The allowance for loan losses was $248 million and the accrual for off-balance sheet credit losses was $5.4 million.\nSecurities and Derivatives\nThe fair value of the available for sale securities portfolio totaled $8.3 billion at December 31, 2017 and $8.4 billion at September 30, 2017.

The increase in net unrealized loss was primarily due to an increase in interest rates during the fourth quarter.\nThe Company also maintains a portfolio of financial instruments consisting primarily of residential mortgage-backed securities issued by U.S. government agencies and interest rate derivative contracts held as an economic hedge of the changes in the fair value of our mortgage servicing rights.\nThe net economic benefit of the changes in fair value of mortgage servicing rights and related economic hedges was $1.3 million during the fourth quarter of 2017, including a $5.9 million increase in the fair value of mortgage servicing rights, a $7.3 million decrease in the fair value of securities and derivative contracts held as an economic hedge and $2.7 million of related net interest revenue.\nThe fair value of mortgage servicing rights, net of economic hedge, increased by $1.0 million in the third quarter.

Related net interest revenue was $2.5 million during the third quarter of 2017.\nConference Call and Webcast\nThe Company will hold a conference call at 9 a.m. Central time on Wednesday, January 24, 2018 to discuss the financial results with investors.
