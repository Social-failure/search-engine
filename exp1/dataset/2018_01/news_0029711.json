The exchange operator said the move was in response to frustration voiced by industry participants over rising closing auction prices. \nClosing auctions attract trillions of dollars’ worth of trades as fund managers generally price their assets to the closing prices of listing exchanges and execute most of their orders at that time. \nThe average daily volume in closing auctions has risen more than 70 percent, to almost 350 million shares, in the past five years, while fees have increased from 16 percent to 60 percent at the NYSE and Nasdaq respectively, Cboe has said. \nCboe lists its parent company’s stock, but otherwise does not have a corporate listings program. \nNYSE and Nasdaq have said diverting trades away from closing auctions would fragment the process, creating volatility and resulting in less accurate pricing for securities. \nCboe said the price discovery process would be unaffected because the exchange would only offer “market on close” (MOC) orders, which are instructions to execute trades at the final closing auction price, and not “limit on close” orders, which specify price limits. \nOn Jan. 8 NYSE lowered its fees for MOC orders. The move will “encourage higher volumes of MOC orders at the close, which should result in a higher level of orders matched and greater liquidity for all exchange auction participants,” NYSE said in a SEC filing. \nThe Cboe Market Close could be in place within a year, Cboe President Chris Concannon told reporters in New York earlier on Wednesday.
