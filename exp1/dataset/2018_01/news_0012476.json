REUTERS/Toby Melville \nIn October 2015, Britain introduced a charge of 5 pence on all single-use plastic bags provided by large shops, which led to an 83 percent reduction in UK plastic bags used in the first year. \nOn Friday the environment ministry said the government was working closely with the sector and had made progress in increasing recycling rates.

Pret A Manger’s customers have benefitted from a 50 pence discount from this week. \nU.S chain Starbucks will trial a 5 pence levy at up to 25 London branches in February for three months. \n“We will investigate the impact of a 5p charge on a paper cup, coupled with prominent marketing of reusable cups, on customer behaviour,” it said in a statement posted on its website.
