Both were delayed by a day due to the U.S. Martin Luther King Jr. Day holiday.\nTighter markets have lifted both crude benchmarks about 13 percent above levels in early December, helped by production curbs by OPEC and Russia, as well as by healthy demand growth. Several analysts this week raised their expectation for 2018 prices on the back of the rally.\nIn a note on Tuesday, Morgan Stanley said it now sees Brent hitting $75 a barrel by the third quarter of 2018, while U.S. crude could hit $70 a barrel. The firm expected flows from hedge funds to keep prices elevated - even though it saw prices retreating later in the year.\nMoney managers have raised bullish positions in WTI and Brent crude futures and options to a record, according to the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission and the Intercontinental Exchange.\nNorbert Ruecker, head of commodity research at Swiss bank Julius Baer, also said that \"hedge fund expectations for further rising prices have reached excessive levels,\" threatening prices.\nThe Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and Russia have been curbing production since January 2017; the cuts are set to last through 2018.\nThe curbs have coincided with strong demand and solid economic growth, tightening the market.\nElsewhere, threats by Nigerian militants on Wednesday to attack offshore oil facilities within days were supportive of prices.\nMarkets may come under pressure from rising U.S. production, analysts say.\nOn Tuesday, the EIA said it expected U.S. oil output to increase in February, with production from shale rising by 111,000 barrels per day (bpd) to 6.55 million bpd.\nU.S. crude output <C-OUT-T-EIA> is expected to soon break 10 million bpd, challenging top producers Russia and Saudi Arabia.\n(Additional reporting by Libby George in London and Henning Gloystein in Singapore; Editing by Marguerita Choy, Tom Brown and Cynthia Osterman)", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-17T22:39:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-19T09:12:55.091+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
