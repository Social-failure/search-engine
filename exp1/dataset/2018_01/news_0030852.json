All SPD party members will vote by mail on a final coalition deal, if there is one.\nMerkel’s top Bavarian ally, Horst Seehofer, on Thursday said an SPD vote against coalition talks would be “a political disaster for our country”, leading to a new election that would likely be followed by even more arduous coalition negotiations.\n“I can only appeal to everybody to get their act together and enable the formation of a government. Anything else would be disastrous for Germany.”\nSocial Democratic Party (SPD) parliamentary group leader Andrea Nahles arrives for talks to form a new government in Berlin, Germany, December 20, 2017. REUTERS/Hannibal Hanschke RENTAL CAP The SPD’s parliamentary leader, Andrea Nahles, said about a third of delegates were still undecided, but she was optimistic a majority would vote to endorse the talks.\nNahles told the Funke Mediengruppe newspaper chain the blueprint agreed with conservatives contained good measures, including plans to boost pensions, phase out a solidarity tax imposed to help poorer eastern states, and avert an upper limit on migration.\nWhile she conceded the SPD had not won all its demands in the negotiations, including a call for a universal health insurance, she said other important projects were within reach.\n“We stand before a difficult fork in the road: Do we want to turn this (agreement) into new policies for the people of our country, or do we want new elections?” she asked.\nThe SPD’s youth and left wings oppose coalition talks and say the blueprint does not contain enough SPD hallmarks.\nA Forsa poll published on Thursday showed the SPD slipping to 18 percent, below the 20.5 percent it achieved in September’s election. Support for Merkel’s CDU/CSU bloc rose to 34 percent, slightly above its election result of 32.9 percent.\nManuela Schwesig, deputy head of the SPD, urged delegates to vote for coalition talks and avoid splitting the party.\nSPD leader Martin Schulz and Michael Groschek, the party leader in the western state of North Rhine-Westphalia (NRW), which accounts for about a quarter of the delegates to Sunday’s vote, on Wednesday both forecast a positive outcome.\nSchulz, seeking to assuage critics’ concerns, told reporters that some areas such as healthcare and rental caps could be added during formal coalition talks, and highlighted the fact that negotiators had agreed to review the deal after two years.\nRefusal by SPD delegates to hold further talks could lead to new elections or a minority government for the first time in Germany’s post-war era.\nAdditional reporting by Andrea Shalal and Tom Koerkemeier; Editing by Alison Williams\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-18T12:24:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-18T12:52:08.008+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
