It's been a long time to carry that secret,\" she said. \nAt 37, Ardern is New Zealand's youngest prime minister since 1856. She is now set to be only the second elected world leader to give birth while in office. \nIn 1990, Benazir Bhutto gave birth to a daughter while serving as Pakistan's prime minister. \nArdern is to take a six-week maternity leave, during which Peters will act as New Zealand's leader. She said her husband is to be a \"stay at home\" dad. \nIn July last year, Ardern had been leader of the opposition for just one day when she was asked by a talk show host if she had to make a choice between children and a career. \nArdern gained an instant boost to her campaign when she answered that such a question was \"totally unacceptable in 2017.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-19T12:11:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-19T13:15:51.003+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
