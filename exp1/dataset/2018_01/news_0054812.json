(TSX: ENB) (NYSE: ENB) (Enbridge or the Company) announced today that it does not intend to exercise its right to redeem its currently outstanding Cumulative Redeemable Preference Shares, Series D (Series D Shares) (TSX: ENB.PR.D) on March 1, 2018. As a result, subject to certain conditions, the holders of the Series D Shares have the right to convert all or part of their Series D Shares on a one-for-one basis into Cumulative Redeemable Preference Shares, Series E of Enbridge (Series E Shares) on March 1, 2018.

There are currently 18,000,000 Series D Shares outstanding.\nWith respect to any Series D Shares that remain outstanding after March 1, 2018, holders thereof will be entitled to receive quarterly fixed cumulative preferential cash dividends, as and when declared by the Board of Directors of Enbridge. The new annual dividend rate applicable to the Series D Shares for the five-year period commencing on March 1, 2018 to, but excluding, March 1, 2023 will be 4.46 percent, being equal to the five-year Government of Canada bond yield of 2.09 percent determined as of today plus 2.37 percent in accordance with the terms of the Series D Shares.\nWith respect to any Series E Shares that may be issued on March 1, 2018, holders thereof will be entitled to receive quarterly floating rate cumulative preferential cash dividends, as and when declared by the Board of Directors of Enbridge. The dividend rate applicable to the Series E Shares for the three-month floating rate period commencing on March 1, 2018 to, but excluding, June 1, 2018 will be 0.89984 percent, based on the annual rate on three month Government of Canada treasury bills for the most recent treasury bills auction of 1.20 percent plus 2.37 percent in accordance with the terms of the Series E Shares (the Floating Quarterly Dividend Rate).
