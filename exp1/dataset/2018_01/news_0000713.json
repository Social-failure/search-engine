The volatility has alarmed some economists, who worry of a bubble . \nThiel and the Founders Fund, however, don’t appear to share those concerns, and are instead pitching Bitcoin to their investors as “a high-risk, high-reward wager similar to its other venture bets,” the report said. \nGet Data Sheet , Fortune’s technology newsletter. \nShares of Bitcoin jumped over 13% on Tuesday from $13,412 to $15,216 after the report, according to Coindesk . \nIn October, Thiel reportedly said during an investment conference in Saudi Arabia that people are “underestimating” Bitcoin and he compared the cryptocurrency to gold. \n“If bitcoin ends up being the cyber equivalent of gold it has a great potential left,” he said at the time. About other cryptocurrencies, however, Thiel said he was “skeptical of most of them.” \nOther cryptocurrencies include Ripple , Ethereum, and Litecoin. \nA Founders Fund spokesperson declined to comment on the report.
