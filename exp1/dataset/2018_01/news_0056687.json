Nations are then classified under four types of governments: full democracy, flawed democracy , hybrid regime and authoritarian regime.\nWithin the region, only Australia and New Zealand classified as full democracies last year, the report found.\nMeanwhile, \"Asia's two largest emerging democracies, India and Indonesia , suffered significant declines in their scores,\" the EIU said, citing a rise in \"conservative religious ideologies.\"\nIndia dropped from the 32nd position in 2016 to the 42nd, while Indonesia slid from 48th to 68th place.\nshow chapters When will Indonesia hike rates? 2:16 AM ET Mon, 4 Dec 2017 | 01:28 Last year's gubernatorial election in Indonesia's capital city, which resulted in the arrest of incumbent governor Basuki Tjahaja Purnama over alleged blasphemy, was a big hit to civil liberties in Southeast Asia's largest economy, the report said. \"Indonesia's stringent blasphemy law has often been used to limit freedom of expression.\"\nIndia, meanwhile, has experienced a series of mob attacks on marginalized groups, particularly Muslims and lower-caste individuals known as Dalits, throughout 2017.\n\"The strengthening of right-wing Hindu forces in an otherwise secular country led to a rise of vigilantism and violence against minority communities as well as other dissenting voices,\" the EIU said.\nThe firm also noted that Myanmar, Cambodia and Vietnam \"sank deeper into authoritarianism\" in 2017 compared to the prior year.\nThe state of media freedom was also a focus in the report. The EIU noted that China, North Korea and Laos \"are black holes for independent news and information.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-31T05:16:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-31T05:16:19.015+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
