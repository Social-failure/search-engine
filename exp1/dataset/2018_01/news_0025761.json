SEEK IMMEDIATE SHELTER. THIS IS NOT A DRILL.” \nThe message caused immediate alarm among residents. Some have warned the state could be a target of an attack against the U.S. by North Korea, given the Hawaiian islands’ location in the Pacific Ocean. \nAt 8:45, a second message followed, saying, “There is no missile threat or danger to the state of Hawaii. Repeat false alarm.” The second message was not in all-capital letters. \nLawmakers in Hawaii were quick to call for fixes to the system. HAWAII - THIS IS A FALSE ALARM. THERE IS NO INCOMING MISSILE TO HAWAII. I HAVE CONFIRMED WITH OFFICIALS THERE IS NO INCOMING MISSILE. pic.twitter.com/DxfTXIDOQs", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-13T17:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-13T22:02:34.030+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
