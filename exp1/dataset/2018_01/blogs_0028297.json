But bipartisan congressional negotiations with the White House faltered last week, prompting Republican leaders to begin pushing for the passage of a stopgap measure to fund the government through Feb. 16.\nThe White House said on Wednesday it supported passage of a short-term funding measure and that immigration talks could resume next week.\nRepublicans hold a 51-49 majority in the Senate and most legislation, including spending bills or an immigration deal, will require 60 votes to pass.\nBut Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer on Wednesday said there was \"revulsion\" among his colleagues for the stopgap proposal in the House and an \"overwhelming number\" would not support it.\nRepublican Senator Lindsey Graham , who is involved in the immigration negotiations, also said he would not vote for a short-term funding bill. His conservative colleague Mike Rounds told CNN on Thursday he could not back the current measure.\nIt was also unclear whether Republicans had the votes in the House to pass a short-term fix since members of the conservative House Freedom Caucus prefer additional defense funding.\nThe group's leader, Representative Mark Meadows , told MSNBC television on Thursday there was not yet enough support among conservatives for the short-term funding measure.\n\"We still don't have the votes here in the House. We made good progress last night. Hopefully, we'll get there today,\" Meadows said, adding that he spoke with Trump on Wednesday night. \"He does not want a shutdown. He made that very clear.\"\nTo entice lawmaker on both sides, the short-term bill would include a six-year extension of the Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP) to lure Democrats, while further delaying some taxes imposed under Obamacare to appeal to Republicans.\nBut that appeared to draw ire from the president, who said in a tweet on Thursday: \"CHIP should be part of a long term solution, not a 30 Day, or short term, extension!\"\nTrump tweet CHIP\nWhite House officials did not immediately respond to a request for comment on whether Trump would still support the measure and sign it into law if it passes both chambers.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-18T12:22:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-18T12:35:21.004+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
