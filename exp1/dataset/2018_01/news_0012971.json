It’s a great joy, I love this sport, it’s a great passion of mine so I missed it.\n“I wasn’t that nervous, although I had that matchplay attitude ... I wanted to be back on court, unfortunately the elbow wouldn’t let me last week.”\nTennis - Kooyong Classic - Kooyong Lawn Tennis Club, Melbourne, Australia, January 10, 2018.

It’s a great start.”\nAnother former grand slam champion, Marin Cilic, did not have such a good day at the former venue of the Australian Open with the Croatian world number six losing 6-7(3) 6-4 7-5 to Australian Matthew Ebden.\nReporting by Nick Mulvenney in Sydney, editing by Peter Rutherford\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-10T06:23:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-10T06:33:27.050+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
