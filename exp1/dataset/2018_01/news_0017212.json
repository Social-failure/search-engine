Bloomberg News first reported the SEC’s discussions with companies over their funds’ proposed names.\nBut the funds - Amplify Transformational Data Sharing ETF and Reality Shares Nasdaq NexGen Economy ETF - will nonetheless trade with the tickers BLOK and BLCN.\nBitcoin’s 1,500 percent surge last year stoked investor demand for any product with exposure to the asset.\nBitcoin BTC=BTSP last fell 15.5 percent to $11,500 on the Bitstamp exchange following reports suggesting South Korea could ban trading in cryptocurrencies.\nThe Reality Shares fund’s backers have said that buying companies that use blockchain to cut costs or start new business lines is a more conservative approach to investing than buying bitcoin directly because those companies are dependent on more factors than just that technology succeeding.\nEastman Kodak Co ( KODK.N ) shares more than doubled last week after the one-time photography leader said it would launch a cryptocurrency called KODAKCoin.\nSoft drinks maker Long Island Iced Tea’s shares have doubled since that company shifted its focus to blockchain and changed its name to Long Blockchain Corp ( LBCC.O ).\nThree other companies have filed proposals for funds that invest primarily in stocks with blockchain exposure.\nReporting by Trevor Hunnicutt; Editing by Jennifer Ablan and Andrew Hay\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-01-17T05:26:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-16T23:48:57.036+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
