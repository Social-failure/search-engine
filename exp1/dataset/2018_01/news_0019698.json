REUTERS/Thomas Peter “I’d like to think that I‘m definitely further along than when I was before Brisbane, and even further along when I was in Sydney,” Konta said.\n”I think even that match in Sydney has helped me along my way in really trying to play at the level that I want to play.\n“I think a lot of it will get better and better with time.”\nMurray’s absence has also reduced the number of Britons in the main singles draw, with Kyle Edmund and Heather Watson the only other players having direct entry.\n“I think it’s sad not to have him here,” Konta said of Murray’s decision to have hip surgery.\n“If anybody is going to be back at the top of their game, it’s going to be him. His drive and passion for this sport is second to none. I like to think he’ll be back, while I‘m shouldering the burden.”\nWriting by Greg Stutchbury in Wellington; Editing by John O'Brien\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-13T09:05:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-13T09:24:23.006+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
