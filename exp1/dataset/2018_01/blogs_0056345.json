Eigendorf said the company is being transformed but the bank has not been matching U.S. rivals when it comes to staff pay.\n\"After we hadn't paid a rival package to most of our senior staff in 2016, we always said that we would pay competitively again in 2017,\" he said.\nLarge bonuses paid to bankers at Deutsche have become a political issue in Germany with the leader of the Social Democratic Party, Martin Schulz, stating the payouts \"hurt the solidarity\" of the community. A government spokesperson on Monday told reporters that the company management should ask what \"impression it leaves in public.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-29T16:04:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-29T16:10:49.015+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
