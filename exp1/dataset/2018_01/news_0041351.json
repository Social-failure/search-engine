Drinks company Diageo ( DGE.L ) said its sales growth was crimped by the strengthening pound. Conversely, the currency move was good news for British clothing retailer Next ( NXT.L ), as RBC upgraded the stock. \nIn the tech sector, Software AG ( SOWGn.DE ) fell 3.7 percent and it reported a decline in third-quarter core profits as its digital, database and consulting divisions all showed lacklustre growth. \nNordic bank Nordea ( NDA.ST ) gave a disappointing update with fourth quarter operating profit below market expectations and fell 2.5 percent. \nClariant ( CLN.S ) sustained the second worst fall, down 4.8 percent as activist investor White Tale sold out of the speciality chemicals group after failing to win an independent strategic review and board seats. \nBritish lender Close Brothers Group ( CBRO.L ) gave a different picture -- seeing a rise in first-half profit, driven by strength in banking and asset management and higher trading income from market maker Winterflood. The shares saw the best performance for the STOXX 600 with a gain close to 6 percent.
