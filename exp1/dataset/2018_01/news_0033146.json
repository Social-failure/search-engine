Several large U.S. companies including Wal-Mart Stores Inc and Apple Inc said they plan to hike wages and/or pay one-time bonuses due to the steep tax cuts. \nLast week, the Labor Department said underlying consumer prices increased 0.3 percent in December for its biggest monthly gain in 11 months. \nAgainst a backdrop that inflation may be heating up, investors have been putting money into TIPS-focused funds whose assets increased to an all-time high of $68.01 billion in the week ended Jan. 10, according to Lipper, a Thomson Reuters unit. \nThe persistent inflows into these funds stoked demand for the TIPS supply, analysts said. \nOn Thursday, the latest 10-year TIPS issue cleared at a yield of 0.548 percent, which was the highest yield in two years but below what traders had expected, Treasury data showed. \nThe ratio of bids to the amount of 10-year TIPS offered was 2.69, which was the highest reading since May 2014. \nOn the open market, the yield premium of regular 10-year Treasury notes over 10-year TIPS rose to 2.09 percent on Thursday, which was the highest level since February, according to Tradeweb.
