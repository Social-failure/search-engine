Genworth shares earlier hit a more than 52-week low of $3.01. \nThe two deals are among many facing CFIUS’s changing standards for deal approval as the United States has become increasingly skeptical of Chinese investment. \nWhile CFIUS has not killed all deals involving Chinese buyers - at least a handful were approved in 2017 - the panel has been increasingly skeptical of Chinese transactions, according to legal experts. \n“We are identifying transactions that, two years ago, we would have expected to be cleared and that, today, we do not expect to be cleared,” said Harry Clark, a CFIUS expert with the law firm Orrick, Herrington and Sutcliffe LLP. \n“Two years ago, it was rare for the government categorically to block deals, formally or informally. It is still not normal but it is also no longer rare,” he said. \nGenworth, which in late November extended its deadline to complete the Oceanwide deal to April 1, said it had been working to allay CFIUS’s concerns with fixes to the deal that would be “more robust than previous CFIUS filings,” Genworth spokeswoman Julie Westermann said in an email statement. \n“Genworth and China Oceanwide have been working with a leading U.S. third party data administrator to implement an additional mitigation approach that further protects our US customers’ personal private data,” Westermann said. \nOceanwide agreed in October 2016 to pay $2.7 billion in cash, or $5.43 per share, to acquire Genworth.
