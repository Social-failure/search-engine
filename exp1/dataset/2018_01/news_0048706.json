REUTERS/Pascal Rossignol \nThe leader of the Force Ouvriere union, which has taken the hardest line, said there would be no let-up in the protests even if wardens were punished and their pay was docked for flouting a ban on strikes in the prison service. \nWardens want a change in their public service grade that would give them higher starting salaries, a demand that would cost around 80 million euros a year, FO’s Emmanuel Baudin said. “That’s nothing,” he said in an interview on CNews TV. \nIt compares to a government offer worth 30 million euros from Belloubet, whose hands look tied by Macron’s promise to keep a lid on public expenditure.

While the FO and CGT unions both rejected her latest offer, she had not yet had word from UFAP-Unsa, the largest wardens’ union. \nThe threat of an extended disruption is weighing on the government, which is broadly seen as having delivered on its promises under Prime Minister Edouard Philippe. \nHazan, the ombudsman, warned that paralysis could lead to mutiny in jails, where three and sometimes four inmates share a cell of less than 10 sq metres (yards). \nShe said that police, who have been sent in to replace off-work wardens in some locations, were there to maintain security, not tend to prisoners’ everyday needs. \n“You can’t leave inmates without the means to keep clean, take showers, eat and see their families,” she said, adding that many prisoners were simply confined to their cells and unable to get out for a prison-yard walk.
