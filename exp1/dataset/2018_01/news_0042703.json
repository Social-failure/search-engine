She will also resign from the board, the company said in a statement. \nPaul Creffield, previously managing director of the company’s commercial development division, has been appointed as group operations director with immediate effect, Countrywide said. \nCreffield’s responsibilities will now also include the sales and lettings division, the company said. \nThe company also said on Wednesday it asked Peter Long, currently a non-executive chairman on the board, to become the executive chairman. \n“Within our core Sales and Lettings area ... we have lost focus and a key priority will be to implement changes that will enable this area to start delivering once again,” Long said. \nThe company said in August that Platt would take on more responsibilities as it executes a new organisational structure.
