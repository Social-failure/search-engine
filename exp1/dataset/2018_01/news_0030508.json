CRUDE RUNS INCREASE BIGGEST IN 4 YEARS \nThe NSB also said China’s oil refinery throughput rose 3.3 percent in December from a year earlier to 49.11 million tonnes, or 11.56 million bpd, off a record of 12.03 million bpd in November. \nRefinery output for the full year gained 5 percent to 567.77 million tonnes, or 11.36 million bpd. That would mean an average increases in runs this year of around 540,000 bpd, according to Reuters calculations based on the data. \nHarry Liu, an analyst with consultancy IHS Markit said the annual growth figure marked the biggest gain in four years, and pointed to an acceleration in throughput in the last four months of the year. \n“Runs expanded much faster since September compared to earlier in the year to an extent that could barely be supported by market fundamentals,” said Liu. \nNSB said crude oil output fell 4.4 percent in December to 15.98 million tonnes, or 3.76 million bpd, and output for the full year was down 4 percent at 191.51 million tonnes, or 3.83 million bpd. \nState energy group CNPC on Tuesday forecast China’s crude oil output would rise 0.2 percent in 2018, on the prospect of higher global oil prices, which have clawed their way back to near $70 a barrel. \n(tonne=7.3 barrels for crude oil) \n($1 = 6.4355 Chinese yuan)", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-18T10:57:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-18T11:19:24.004+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
