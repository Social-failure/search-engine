The Trump administration will rely on guidance from previous executive branches about what exactly happens to federal workers. \nUnder established precedent, fewer than 1 million federal civilian workers will stop working during a shutdown, according to the Associated Press. As it started on a Saturday, the effects would get felt more if the lapse lasted until Monday. \nGovernment services considered essential including air traffic control, Social Security benefits, Medicare will go on. The Postal Service will continue delivering mail. Uniformed military members are exempt. \nSome national monuments, parks or museums could close down. \nSome federal workers who stay on the job do not get paid during the lapse in funding. In the past, they have gotten paid after the fact. \nBoth Republican and Democratic leaders tried to preemptively heap blame on the opposing party. Observers saw high stakes for avoiding a perception of responsibility for a shutdown ahead of Novemberâ€™s critical midterm elections. \nHowever, past shutdowns have not shown clear political repercussions.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-20T07:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-20T07:04:28.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
