There were no reports of casualties or damage.\nThe Iranian-aligned Houthis have launched scores of missiles at the kingdom. While causing little serious damage, they have deepened tensions between Riyadh and Tehran.\nSaudi Arabia accuses Iran of supplying missile parts and expertise to the Houthis, who have taken over the Yemeni capital Sanaa and other parts of the country during its civil war. Iran and the Houthis deny the charge.\nA Saudi-led military coalition intervened in the conflict in March 2015 after the movement drove Yemeni President Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi into exile.\nThe conflict has killed more than 10,000 people, displaced over two million and unleashed a wave of hunger and disease.\nReporting By Noah Browning and Mostafa; Editing by Janet Lawrence\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-20T13:29:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-20T13:42:51.011+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
