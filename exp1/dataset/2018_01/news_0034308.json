He has already been linked with several other labels.\nFashion industry news site WWD reported last September that Jones had held discussions with Italy’s Versace. Britain’s Burberry, meanwhile, is looking for a replacement for outgoing artistic director Christopher Bailey, though the new designer would be at the helm of womenswear too.\nBurberry, which posted a 2 percent drop in retail revenue over the Christmas period on Wednesday, said it was not commenting on speculation as it carries out its search, while Versace declined to comment.\nIn the notoriously fickle world of fashion, design changes have helped boost some brands more than others in recent years at a time when luxury goods makers are trying to win over younger consumers and tap into a revival in Chinese demand.\nUnder a new CEO-designer pairing at Kering-owned Gucci, revenue growth has outstripped that of peers in recent quarters after the Italian fashion house reivented itself with a rococo new look.\nJones will present his last menswear collection for Vuitton on Thursday, during the men’s fall/winter fashion week in Paris, which runs until Jan. 21.\nLVMH does not break out sales for its brands, but Vuitton is the main driver behind its fashion and leather goods division, which reported a 13 percent rise in like-for-like sales in the third quarter from a year earlier. Balenciaga alumnus Nicolas Ghesquiere is Vuitton’s creative director for womenswear.
