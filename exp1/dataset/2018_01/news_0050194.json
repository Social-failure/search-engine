Apple reports its latest quarter on Thursday.\n\"The question is: Are the earnings estimates going to come down enough that it becomes an expensive stock?\" asked Cramer, whose charitable trust owns shares of Apple. \n\"I don't think anybody believes at this point that the next quarter will be as good as we thought,\" Cramer added.\nCramer said the news could represent an opportunity for investors, but he cautioned against selling Apple's stock.\n\"I think if you sell Apple here, maybe you can make a little money,\" Cramer said on \" Squawk on the Street \" shortly after Monday's report. \"I just don't want to trade it.\"\n\"Do you want to sell it knowing they have a little bit of money they could distribute to shareholders?\" Cramer asked.\nThe U.S. tech giant announced earlier this month it will repatriate virtually all of its $250 billion in overseas cash.\n\nMorning Squawk: CNBC's before the bell news roundup Sign up to get Morning Squawk each weekday\nJob Industry Advertising/Marketing Automotive Communications/PR Construction/Manufacturing Education Finance/Banking/Insurance Legal Media/Entertainment Medical/Health Care Mining/Oil/Gas/Utilities Gov't/Non-Profit Real Estate Retail Technology/IT Transportation/Shipping Travel/Hospitality Other Get this delivered to your inbox, and more info about about our products and service.
