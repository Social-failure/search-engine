She said the statement was discussed with the company beforehand.\n“Global trends are changing fast,” Hyundai Motor Vice Chairman Chung Eui-sun said, according to the statement. “We will recruit better, top-level talent in these new businesses and develop them going forward.”\nHyundai Motor said earlier this month it had invested in Southeast Asian ride-hailing firm Grab, as it seeks to expand into the region to reduce its reliance on China following a damaging diplomatic row between Seoul and Beijing.\nFinance Minister Kim also said on Wednesday authorities will leave foreign exchange rates to market participants but take action if needed.\nThe won was trading down 0.3 percent at 1,065.8 per dollar as of 0442 GMT. Currency dealers have suspected foreign exchange authorities of engaging in intervention to slow the won’s rise.\nReporting by Shin-hyung Lee and Joyce Lee; Additional reporting by Ju-min Park; Editing by Simon Cameron-Moore and Muralikumar Anantharaman\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-01-17T14:41:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-17T10:47:09.052+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
