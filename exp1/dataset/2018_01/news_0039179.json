Pastrnak sent the puck to the front of the net from the corner of the rink and it somehow slipped past Price, who appeared to have left his position early in anticipation of it being a pass to the slot.\nKrug scored the eventual game-winner with a beautiful tally. While the Bruins were creating all kinds of chaos in the Montreal zone, Krug jumped down from his point position to take a feed from Pastrnak, after which he ripped a high shot home.\nAfter Pastrnak notched his 20th goal of the season, Riley Nash rounded out the scoring with an empty-net goal. Brad Marchand had two assists and Patrice Bergeron added a helper to remain red hot, having collected nine goals and six assists in the last nine games.\nAfter a scoreless first period, Max Pacioretty opened the scoring for the Canadiens, potting his seventh goal in as many games to the delight of the Bell Centre crowd. Paul Byron stripped Bruins defenseman Charlie McAvoy of the puck in the neutral zone to create an odd-man rush, then fed the Montreal captain with a perfect pass, and Pacioretty promptly rifled the puck past Rask. With his assist, Byron has now collected five points in four games.\nPrice stopped 23 shots for the Canadiens, who have just three wins in their last 12 games (3-7-2).\n--Field Level Media\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-01-21T11:10:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-21T13:22:23.014+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
