Stunted children generally complete fewer years of schooling and earn less as adults and the effects are largely irreversible.\nThe study, by ICRISAT and Malawi’s Lilongwe University of Agriculture and Natural Resources, focused on 179 mothers of children under two years of age in two districts, where the majority of families are smallholder farmers.\nThe researchers developed two porridge recipes using locally available foods such as maize, groundnut, carrots and pigeon peas, and had mothers raising healthy children lead cooking and training sessions for those with undernourished children.\nThey recorded daily the children’s weight, height, and mid-upper arm circumference - measures of under-nutrition - and the incidence of diseases such as diarrhea, which the World Health Organization said is the leading cause of malnutrition in children.\nThe results showed that children whose mothers received training showed progressive improvements in weight.\nCases of diarrhea also disappeared almost entirely, said the study, published the Journal of Public Health Nutrition, Cambridge University Press on Wednesday.\nReporting By Thin Lei Win, Editing by Ros Russell; Please credit the Thomson Reuters Foundation, the charitable arm of Thomson Reuters, that covers humanitarian news, women's rights, corruption and climate change.
