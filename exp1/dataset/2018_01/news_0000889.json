A judicial official said some could face the death penalty.\n“The seditionist rioters should be executed,” marchers chanted on Wednesday, while posters they carried said hostile “hidden hands” guided from the United States, Israel and the United Kingdom should be cut off.\nIn at attempt to control the flow of information and calls for anti-government gatherings, Tehran authorities have restricted access to the Telegram messaging app and Instagram, owned by Facebook Inc.\nHigh prices, alleged corruption and mismanagement are fuelling the anger.\nPresident Hassan Rouhani championed a deal struck with world powers in 2015 to curb Iran’s nuclear programme in return for the lifting of most international sanctions.\nHowever, he has failed to deliver on promises of prosperity in the OPEC oil producer where youth unemployment reached 28.8 percent last year.\nThe nuclear deal is facing its biggest challenge since it was struck, with U.S. President Donald Trump due to decide by mid-January whether to continue waiving U.S. sanctions or reimpose them.\nReporting by Bozorgmehr Sharafedin; editing by John Stonestreet\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-03T10:18:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-03T10:37:07.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
