Sandhu, a senior police official, adding that police had detained 15 protesters. \n“We will not tolerate any violence in the name of protests against a movie,” Sandhu added. “Sporadic rioting did take place but no one will be allowed to protest now.” \nIndian films that touch upon the historical relationships of Hindus, India’s majority religion, and Muslim leaders are often controversial. \nIn the financial capital of Mumbai, police have boosted security at all theaters screening the film, and detained more than 100 members of protest groups, such as the conservative Sri Rajput Karni Sena, as a precaution, a senior police official said.

I think this is a decision that almost every theater owner in these two states has taken,” he added. \nIn the central state of Chhattisgarh, dozens of members of the Rajput community staged protests and burned an effigy of Bhansali on Tuesday, Rakesh Singh Bais of the community group Sarwa Kshatriya Mahasabha told Reuters. \nPolice in northwestern Rajasthan have enforced tight security for protests planned by the Karni Sena and other Rajput groups, its police chief, O. P. Galhotra, said. \n“We have been talking to the leaders of the Karni Sena and they don’t want to end their protest,” Galhotra added. “We have decided to allow them to hold small protests, and have made adequate arrangements to maintain law and order.” \nAnyone trying to depict history as fiction will have to pay a price for their mistake, said Rajvansh Singh, an official of the Karni Sena in the city of Chittorgarh in Rajasthan, who called himself the custodian of respect for Rajput women. \n“We will not allow the movie to be released,” he said. “Queen Padmini is like our goddess, no one will be allowed to insult our goddess and our Hindu pride.” Additional reporting by Shilpa Jamkhandikar and Rajendra Jadhav; Writing by Swati Bhat; Editing by Euan Rocha and Clarence Fernandez", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-24T15:42:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-24T16:53:31.012+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
