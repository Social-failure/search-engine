Some people misspoke”. \n“This statement is important but Turkey cannot remain silent in the face of any formation which will threaten its borders,” Turkish Justice Minister Abdulhamit Gul told broadcaster NTV when asked about Tillerson’s comments. \nAnkara views the YPG as an extension of the Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK) militant group, which has fought an insurgency in southeast Turkey since 1984. Turkey, the United States and the European Union deem the PKK a terrorist group. \nTurkey and the United States, both allies in NATO, have been on the same side for much of Syria’s civil war, both supporting rebels fighting to overthrow Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. But a decision by Washington to back Kurdish forces fighting against Islamic State infuriated Ankara.
