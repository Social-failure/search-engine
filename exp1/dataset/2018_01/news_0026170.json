Prices were dented by substantially higher EU sugar production.\n“It’s supply and demand...It was a lovely summer and the beet just carried on growing,” said Bason.\nAnalysts at Barclays cut their 2017-18 forecast for profit from sugar from 184 million pounds to 151 million pounds. AB Foods made 223 million pounds from sugar in 2016-17.\nIn the 16-weeks to Jan. 6, AB Sugar’s revenue fell 12 percent at constant currency.\nGroup revenue for period rose 4 percent at constant currency rates.\nPRIMARK GROWTH At Primark, the discount fashion chain which accounts for about half of group revenue and profit, sales rose 7 percent on a constant currency basis, driven by new store openings.\nIn Britain, which contributes about half of Primark’s revenue, the retailer reported strong like-for-like sales growth and market share gains.\nBarclays estimated the like-for-like sales rise at close to 4 percent - well ahead of Christmas sales updates from British rivals Marks & Spencer and Next.\nHowever, Primark’s sales growth across mainland Europe was held back by unseasonably warm weather in October. It said trading in the United States had continued to make progress.\nPrimark’s operating margins in the first half were now expected to be close to those in the same period last year.\nBritons, under pressure from slow wage growth, compounded by higher inflation in the wake of the 2016 referendum vote to leave the EU, cut back in the run-up to Christmas, company updates and survey data this month have shown.\nHowever, most analysts regard Primark as well positioned to withstand the pressure on discretionary spending.\n“The data would say that for UK consumers their disposable income has been tightened...But to just simply attribute (Primark’s UK growth) to that would be wrong,” said Bason.\n“We’ve got great stuff in there and we’re really good at engagement with our customers with social media and digital.”\nPrior to Thursday’s update analysts average EPS forecast for 2017-18 was 135.6 pence, according to Reuters data, up from 127.1 pence in 2016-17.
