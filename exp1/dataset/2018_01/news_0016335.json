But a sustainable solution to the challenges of the new information ecosystem requires further measures,” he said.\n“In particular, a viable subscription model on platforms that enables publishers to build a direct relationship with readers and to manage the terms of access to their content.” (Reporting by Aishwarya Venugopal in Bengaluru; editing by Patrick Graham)\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-01-12T21:36:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-13T14:56:08.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
