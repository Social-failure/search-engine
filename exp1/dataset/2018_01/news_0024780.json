Data released last week showed that China's surplus with the U.S. hit a record high in 2017 of $275.81 billion. The previous record surplus took place in 2015, hitting $260.8 billion.\nPresident Trump, who takes an \"America First\" approach when it comes to trade and foreign policy, has criticized China for running a surplus against many international partners. It has also blamed Beijing for keeping its currency undervalue on purpose. However, according to Miranda Carr, China macro strategist at Haitong, the U.S. is running out of arguments.\n\"Every time they (the U.S.) try to attack China on something like, say the currency, they say 'well your currency, you've kept it undervalue,' then they (China) will go, 'well it's rising now,' so that cuts that argument off,\" Carr told CNBC.\nshow chapters Why China's commodity prices are rising, according to one Haitong strategist 13 Hours Ago | 03:16 \"Then with steel, the fact that (Chinese) exports have gone down 30 percent that cuts that argument off; so they (the U.S.) are now struggling. If you look at how the negotiations go, then they are now moving to aluminum, which is still a problem, but of course China is cutting back on aluminum production, cutting back on exports, so therefore it's taking some of those pressures away.\"\n\"If the U.S. keeps attacking China on certain areas then China goes 'well we've sorted it now, you don't need to take those actions.'\"\nPresident Trump is due to receive the results of two inquiries by the U.S. Commerce department on steel and aluminum shipments, which could ultimately prompt the president to issue sanctions against China.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-12T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-16T10:39:48.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
