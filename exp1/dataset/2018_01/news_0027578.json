Without going into the question of guilt, it would be simpler for everyone,” said the Frenchman, who was elected last September.\n“It’s up to (team manager Dave) Brailsford to take his responsibilities. Apart from that I think that it is what the other riders wish.”\nLappartient, who said he was notified of Froome’s test result an hour after being elected in Bergen, Norway, on Sept. 21 last year, believes that “in the eyes of the wider public (the Briton) is already guilty.”\nFrenchman Romain Bardet, who finished on the Tour podium in the last two editions, said earlier this week that Froome should pull out of racing until the case is over.\nThe affair, however, is likely to drag on, according to Lappartient.\n“It’s going to be a long judicial battle. It can last at least a year,” he said.\nReporting by Julien Pretot; Editing by Amlan Chakraborty\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-01-19T18:06:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-19T13:42:31.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
