We generate significant cash flow. We are going to look at opportunities on a case-by-case basis,” he told reporters. \n“We also identified CHC (consumer healthcare) previously as an area where we want to sustain a leadership position and therefore you can expect us to evaluate opportunities.” \nBoth Pfizer and Merck KGaA are currently looking to divest consumer health businesses. \nSanofi, which expects the cost of debt to finance the deal to be around 1 percent, said Ablynx would boost long-term shareholder value, while being neutral for business earnings per share in 2018 and 2019. \nThe Belgian group specializes in the research of novel drugs based on so-called nanobodies found in the immune systems of llamas and alpacas, for which it partners with several of the world’s largest pharmaceutical companies.

REUTERS/Christian Hartmann/File Photo EXPERIMENTAL DRUG \nSanofi is already one of Ablynx’s big pharma partners, after striking a deal in July 2017 to find new treatments for inflammatory diseases. \nBy buying the company outright it will now get access to Ablynx’s most promising asset, the experimental drug caplacizumab for treating the blood disease acquired thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura. \nBrandicourt said caplacizumab would complement Sanofi’s line-up of blood products, following the acquisition of Bioverativ and an earlier deal to obtain global rights for fitusiran from Alnylam. \nSanofi will be able to use its existing infrastructure and the recently acquired platform from Bioverativ to help to commercialize caplacizumab. It will also benefit from some of the other drugs Ablynx is working on, such as an infant anti-viral treatment, that would not have fitted within Novo Nordisk. \nBerenberg analysts said Ablynx was a good fit but they estimated the deal would generate no more than a 4 percent return on invested capital, assuming caplacizumab sales of around 400 million euros by 2023. \nAblynx itself has forecast peak caplacizumab sales of 1.2 billion euros, but Sanofi said it was too early to comment. \nThe rare blood drug was also the main attraction for Novo Nordisk. \nThe Danish group has sat out previous rounds of M&A in the drugs sector to focus on its core diabetes business but it now needs to find new products for its struggling smaller biopharmaceutical unit, where Ablynx would have been a good fit. \nThat remains a challenge for CEO Lars Fruergaard Jorgensen, who took over a year ago, and has previously stated that Novo Nordisk needs external innovation to broaden its product line-up. Related Coverage Novo Nordisk remains on hunt for biopharma deals \nChief Financial Officer Jesper Brandgaard told Reuters Novo Nordisk would continue to hunt for promising assets to boost its blood products business. \nShares in Sanofi were little changed, with pricing considerations offset by relief that Sanofi was finally taking action to improve its drugs portfolio, following its past failure to land big deals. \nSanofi lost out on buying California-based cancer specialist Medivation to Pfizer in 2016, and also missed acquiring Swiss biotech company Actelion, which was bought by Johnson & Johnson last year. \nMorgan Stanley and Lazard advised Sanofi on the deal while JP Morgan advised Ablynx. \n($1 = 0.8055 euros) Additional reporting by Sudip Kar-Gupta in Paris, Teis Jensen and Stine Jacobsen in Copenhagen, and Robert-Jan Bartunek in Brussels; Editing by Louise Heavens, Alexander Smith and Jane Merrmiman", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-29T17:57:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-29T19:47:55.042+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
