Since going public in 2011, we have had six consecutive years of earnings per share growth. An increase in core earnings combined with internal operational efficiencies continues to have a positive effect on return on assets, return on equity and our efficiency ratio,” stated John J. Patrick Jr., First Connecticut Bancorp’s Chairman, President and CEO.\n“Additionally, we increased our dividend $0.06 or 67% during 2017 as we continue to reward shareholders with a combination of share price appreciation and increased dividend yield.”\nFinancial Highlights\nOrganic loan growth remained strong during the fourth quarter of 2017 as loans increased $49.5 million to $2.7 billion at December 31, 2017 primarily due to a $34.8 million increase in commercial real estate loans and a $19.7 million increase in residential real estate loans.

Any statements contained herein that are not statements of historical fact may be deemed to be . Such may or may not include words such as “believe,” “expect,” “anticipate,” “estimate,” and “intend” or future or conditional verbs such as “will,” “would,” “should,” “could” or “may.” Forward-looking statements are subject to numerous assumptions, risks and uncertainties. There are a number of important factors described in documents previously filed by the Company Commission, and other factors that could cause the Company's actual results to differ materially from those contemplated by such . The Company undertakes no obligation to publicly release the results of any revisions to those which may be made to reflect events or circumstances after the date of this release or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nIn addition to evaluating the Company’s financial performance in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”), management routinely supplements their evaluation with an analysis of certain non-GAAP financial measures, such as core net income, the efficiency ratio and tangible book value per share. A reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure; net income in the case of core net income and the efficiency ratio and stockholders’ equity in the case of tangible book value per share, appears in the accompanying Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures table.\nWe believe that providing certain non-GAAP financial measures provides investors with information useful in understanding our financial performance, our performance trends and financial position. Specifically, we provide measures based on what we believe are our operating earnings on a consistent basis and exclude non-core operating items which affect the GAAP reporting of results of operations. The Company believes that core net income is useful for both investors and management to understand the effects of items that are non-recurring and infrequent in nature. The Company believes that the efficiency ratio, which measures the costs expended to generate a dollar of revenue, is useful in the assessment of financial performance, including non-interest expense control. The Company believes that tangible book value per share is useful to evaluate the relative strength of the Company’s capital position. The Company does not have goodwill and intangible assets for any of the periods presented. As such, tangible book value per common share is equal to book value per common share.\nWe utilize these measures for internal planning and forecasting purposes. These non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered a substitute for GAAP basis measures and results, and we strongly encourage investors to review our consolidated financial statements in their entirety and not to rely on any single financial measure.\nFirst Connecticut Bancorp, Inc.
