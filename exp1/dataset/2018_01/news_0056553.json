On Wednesday Clarke said Treasury would install its own distributors to tighten control over its sales in up to 15 U.S. states.\n“Once we get to bedding down this business in America, I think this business will take off, much like it took off in China,” Clarke said on an analyst call.\nTreasury shares rose as much as 2 percent, touching a record intraday peak of A$17.36, triple the value of two takeover offers the company rejected in 2014.\nThe Melbourne-based company said booming Asia sales helped it grow net profit 37 percent to A$187.2 million and beat analyst estimates in the six months to Dec. 31, while sales volumes in the Americas declined 10 percent due to a plan to sell less cheap product there.\nSales volumes in North Asia meanwhile leapt 60 percent as a new generation of wealthy consumers has taken to drinking wine with daily meals or for fun.\n“China’s a very special market in terms of the demand for wine but in the U.S., due to its size and the scale they have over there, they should be able to take advantage of any potential acquisitions and organic growth as well,” said OptionsXPress analyst Ben Le Brun.\nClarke acknowledged that overhauling the company’s U.S. distribution network would be complex and potentially unpopular with retailers, but added it was necessary to improve efficiency and control.\nTreasury announced its results two weeks earlier than expected because of a leak in the United States concerning the changes to its distribution network, Clarke added.\nThe company expected to post pre-tax profit of A$524 million in the full 2018 fiscal year, which would be an increase of 15 percent on the prior year, he added.\nTreasury declared an interim dividend of 15 cents per share, up from 13 cents a share a year earlier.\n$1 = 1.2401 Australian dollars Reporting by Byron Kaye in Sydney and Chandini Monnappa in Bengaluru; Editing by Stephen Coates\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-31T05:19:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-31T05:42:27.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
