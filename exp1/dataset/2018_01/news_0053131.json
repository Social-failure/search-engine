An SEC spokesman and Justice Department spokeswoman declined to comment. \nThe company admitted in December that iPhone software can slow down some phones with battery problems. \nApple said the problem was that aging lithium batteries delivered power unevenly, which could cause iPhones to shut down unexpectedly to protect the delicate circuits inside. \nApple posted a public apology over its handling of the battery issue and lowered the price of iPhone battery replacements from $79 to $29.
