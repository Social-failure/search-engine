COSCO Shipping has also previously sailed vessels through the Arctic’s northeast passage.\nChina’s increasing prominence in the region has prompted concerns from Arctic states over its long-term strategic objectives, including possible military deployment.\n“Some people may have misgivings over our participation in the development of the Arctic, worried we may have other intentions, or that we may plunder resources or damage the environment,” Vice-Foreign Minister Kong Xuanyou said at a briefing.\n“I believe these kinds of concerns are absolutely unnecessary.”\nThe white paper said China also eyes development of oil, gas, mineral resources and other non-fossil energies, fishing and tourism in the region. It said it would do so “jointly with Arctic States, while respecting traditions and cultures of the Arctic residents including the indigenous peoples and conserving natural environment”.\nChina’s Belt and Road initiative aims to connect China to Europe, the Middle East and beyond via massive infrastructure projects across dozens of countries, reflecting Xi’s desire for China to take on a more prominent global leadership role.\nReporting by Philip Wen; Editing by Nick Macfie\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-26T08:38:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-26T09:11:20.001+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
