We expect that the growth will continue in the future,” the council said in a statement\n** “One example is the potential for China. Given a full normalisation of the market access, salmon exports may reach 156,000 tonnes in 2025, equivalent to 12 per cent of current salmon production in Norway,” said Sigmund Bjoergo, the Norwegian Seafood Council’s Country Director in China ($1 = 8.0571 Norwegian crowns) (Reporting by Terje Solsvik)\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-01-08T14:25:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-09T17:18:45.007+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
