Indeed, as our analysis will show – the harder the Brexit, the worse will be the outcome,” Sturgeon said.\nMay is preparing for the start of talks about Britain’s trade relationship with the EU once it is no longer a member.\nAgreeing a united stance has been made harder by infighting in May’s cabinet and Conservative Party over their vision for the new relationship with the EU, while the biggest opposition party, Labour, is also split on the best way forward.\nSpeaking to the BBC’s Andrew Marr, Sturgeon again urged for Labour to sign up for Britain to remain in the single market, but leader Jeremy Corbyn said membership of the market was dependent on being a member of the EU.\nScotland's First Minister, Nicola Sturgeon, is seen speaking on the BBC's Andrew Marr Show in this photograph received via the BBC, in London, Britain January 14, 2018.
