Bandar Algaloud/Courtesy of Saudi Royal Court/Handout via REUTERS Asked if Prince Mohammed, known as MbS, would be visiting Paris, Jubeir said: “Yes, god willing. He received an invitation from President Emmanuel Macron. We’re thinking about an end February-early March date.”\nHe said the exact date had not been finalised yet but would be decided upon in the coming weeks. Jubeir’s comments were broadcast via a French translation.\nSpearheaded by Prince Mohammed, Saudi Arabia has detained dozens of senior business people and government officials, accusing them of crimes including money laundering although not of terror financing.\nPrince Mohammed is also leading sweeping economic and social reforms intended to remodel the world’s top oil exporter and biggest Arab economy into a modern state no longer dependent on petroleum. These include the planned the sale of five percent of state oil giant Saudi Aramco, which could be the biggest IPO in history.\nReporting by Ingrid Melander, Editing by William Maclean\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-05T20:03:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-05T20:32:11.003+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
