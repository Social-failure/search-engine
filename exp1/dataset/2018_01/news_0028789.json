The panel’s Republican chairman, Chuck Grassley, had not agreed to the release.\nFusion GPS, based in Washington, hired former British spy Christopher Steele to investigate Trump’s business dealings with Russia.\nTrump has repeatedly criticized the dossier, which was based on Steele’s investigation, calling it “bogus” and “discredited and phony.”\nSome Republicans critical of Mueller’s investigation into possible collusion between the Trump campaign and Russian officials have claimed that Steele’s dossier triggered the initial probe by the Federal Bureau of Investigation.\nThey have raised questions about whether the FBI may have relied on the Steele document to improperly obtain surveillance warrants to spy on Trump’s campaign associates.\nThe testimony by Fusion GPS’s Simpson before the Senate Judiciary Committee in August contradicted those claims.\nEver since Feinstein released that testimony on Jan. 9, House Intelligence Committee Democrats have been asking that Simpson’s testimony to their committee be made public.\nRussia has denied interfering in the election and Trump has denied any collusion.\nReporting by Patricia Zengerle; Editing by Jonathan Oatis\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-18T18:02:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-18T18:15:06.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
