It would be the opposite of fair,” Dulger told WirtschaftsWoche. \nThree rounds of regional talks have failed to reach agreement. \nA fourth round begins in the southwestern state of Baden-Wuerttemberg, home to Mercedes-Benz maker Daimler ( DAIGn.DE ) and sports car brand Porsche ( VOWG_p.DE ), on Jan. 24. \nAny deal in Baden-Wuerttemberg would typically be applied in other states as well. \nIf the two sides remain at loggerheads, IG Metall’s leadership may decide at a meeting on Jan. 26 to call for 24-hour walkouts or ballot the union’s members on strike action. \nMore than half a million workers at hundreds of metals and engineering companies have taken part in industrial action this month to support IG Metall’s demands.
