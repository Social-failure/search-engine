It had added 0.4 percent on Monday. \nThe Australian financial index closed down 0.6 percent, with its biggest drag, Macquarie Group Ltd, losing 1.6 percent. \nMaterials slipped and were the biggest weight on the benchmark, underpinned by a fall in Chinese iron ore futures. Global miner BHP Billiton dipped 1.3 percent to a near four-week low, while rival Rio Tinto Ltd slid 0.7 percent. \nHurt by a continued fall in oil prices, the energy index closed at its lowest in a week, with oil and gas company Woodside Petroleum Ltd dipping 2.2 percent. \nIn New Zealand, the benchmark S&P/NZX 50 index declined 0.4 percent, or 29.01 points, to 8,298.58. \nConsumer staples led the decliners, with dairy firm a2 Milk Company Ltd falling 2.6 percent.
