She said her team had so far recovered $20 million and confiscated $5 million dollars worth of assets.\nShe added that various international arrest warrants had been issued for suspects who had fled the country. Panamanian authorities have also sought judicial assistance from the United States, China, the British Virgin Islands and Hong Kong to recover some of the paper assets.\nThe alleged acts took place during the administration of Ricardo Martinelli, the country’s president from 2009 to 2014, who was arrested in Miami in June 2017 on an extradition warrant from Panama.\nHe was alleged to have tapped the phones of opposition politicians and is facing multiple investigations for corruption. Martin has denied the charges, calling them politically motivated.\nReporting by Elida Moreno; Editing by Diane Craft\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-16T04:26:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-16T04:37:21.006+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
