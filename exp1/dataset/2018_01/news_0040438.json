He is not that kind of guy,” the Swede, who has helped transform Edmund’s fortunes since being hired in October, told reporters.\nEdmund is no flash Harry, on or off the court -- a trait he shares with three-times grand slam champion Andy Murray, who has carried the flag for British tennis for more than a decade.\nA cricket lover, Edmund admitted after his quarter-finals victory over world number three Grigor Dimitrov that one of his idols, former Australia captain Ricky Ponting, did not recognize him when they were in the same restaurant this week.\nWhile bashful off court, however, there is nothing timid about his no-frills playing style. Essentially, it involves cranking up a forehand forged in a blast furnace and burning the felt off the ball.\nThree-times Australian Open champion Mats Wilander describes it as the best forehand in the business.\nThat said, he is no one-trick pony. His serve is vastly improved under Rosengren, as is his defense, even if Edmund prefers to be wheeling away in the center court.\nMENTAL GAME With so much raw material to work with, Rosengren’s main work with Edmund is between the ears -- curing the all-too-regular lapses that were holding him back.\n”Tennis is a mental game,“ the former coach of Magnus Norman said. ”I‘m not there to teach him how to hit forehands and backhands, he’s so good at that. It’s more to get everything together so he can use his strength at the right moment.\n“Was about making him play depending on the scoreboard, knowing when the pressure was himself or on the other guy. Trying to teach Kyle to understand the game.”\nEdmund is guaranteed to climb to 25th in the world rankings and could overtake Murray if he gets to the final here.\nHe will have to find another level if he is to continue his run but can take inspiration from Thomas Johansson, who he has been hitting with this week.\nThe Swede came from nowhere to win the title in 2002 as 16th seed, the lowest seed other than Federer to claim the title in the professional era, with the Swiss triumphing last year as the 17th seed after a long injury layoff.\n“His forehand is huge, it’s massive. I think he’s also improved his serve a lot,” Johansson told reporters. “I think he has a big potential to get into the top 10.”\nEdmund will certainly have plenty of support against Cilic on Thursday. “Yorkshire... Yorkshire” his fans chanted against Dimitrov on his Rod Laver Arena debut as he won in four sets.\n“It was unbelievable how he handled yesterday,” Rodengren said. “He was so relaxed. I told him go on there, take the stage, be the man, no excuses.”\nThat will also be the mantra against sixth seed Cilic.\nReporting by Martyn Herman; Editing by John O'Brien\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-24T11:13:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-24T11:58:52.002+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
