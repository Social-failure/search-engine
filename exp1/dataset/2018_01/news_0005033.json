The SPD leadership is due to recommend on Friday whether or not to start those talks, and it will then be up to an SPD party congress on Jan. 21 to make a decision. NOT SO GRAND?

REUTERS/Hannibal Hanschke \nA coalition between Merkel’s CDU/CSU alliance - which lost ground to the AfD in September’s ballot - and the SPD has run Europe’s largest economy for eight of the last 12 years. \nBut it has tended to be viewed as a last resort by both politicians and voters as it leaves the opposition weak. \nA poll for broadcaster ARD showed more than half of the electorate - 52 percent - are sceptical about reviving it, while 45 percent are in favour.

The SPD in the eastern state of Thuringia is also sceptical about such a tie-up. \nSenior SPD member Thomas Oppermann told Welt am Sonntag newspaper that Merkel should step down during the current parliament and called for a chancellor’s tenure to be limited to eight or 10 years. \nVolker Bouffier, a senior member of Merkel’s Christian Democrats (CDU), told Rheinische Post newspaper his party intended to form a grand coalition but that it could not come at any price, while Bavarian CSU leader Horst Seehofer said participants needed to come to an agreement. \nThe potential partners have agreed on a news blackout during the exploratory talks, which are due to finish on Thursday. \nIf the parties then progress to more detailed coalition talks, the consensus among politicians and observers is that those discussions would last until at least March. \nBut if the exploratory discussions fail, Germany could either face fresh elections or, for the first time in the post-war era, a minority government. additional reporting by Holger Hansen; Writing by Michelle Martin; editing by John Stonestreet", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-07T11:19:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-07T11:38:02.821+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
