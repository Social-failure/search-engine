Tennis - Australian Open - Melbourne, Australia, January 16, 2018. Milos Raonic of Canada looks at a moth during his match against Lukas Lacko of Slovakia. REUTERS/Edgar Su \nTwo more aces, taking his match tally to 36, briefly gave 22nd seed Raonic a 4-3 lead but he was unable to match Lacko’s accuracy and mobility and the Slovak progressed to meet Argentine Nicolas Kicker in round two. \nRaonic has struggled since reaching last year’s Wimbledon quarter-finals and missed the U.S. Open with a wrist injury. Slideshow (5 Images) \nHe then hurt his calf in Tokyo in October and suffered a knee injury in November, cutting short his off-season training. \n”I‘m not where I need to be at,“ Raonic, now ranked 23, said. ”I struggled physically, but thankfully not through injury. Just in terms of fitness and being prepared. \n“I was just not sharp, not quick, not hitting hard or aggressive and couldn’t dictate.” Reporting by Nick Mulvenney in Sydney, editing by Peter Rutherford", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-01-16T12:06:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-16T06:14:57.004+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
