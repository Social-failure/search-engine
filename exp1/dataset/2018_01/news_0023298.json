The country already lagged regional peers such as Colombia and Brazil, both of which have made strides in setting up independent prosecutors.\nMexico is making little headway in seizing illicit cash, according to the government’s own estimates. It seized just $32.5 million in 2016, representing less than 0.1 percent of the $58.5 billion of illicit revenues the government estimates is generated by organized crime annually.\nAdditional reporting by Michael O'Boyle; Editing by Michael Perry\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-11T07:04:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-11T07:15:50.032+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
