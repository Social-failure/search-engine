The South African parliament has also said it would no longer use the company.\nKPMG is one of several high-profile international companies facing questions about its work for the Indian-born Gupta brothers, who have been accused by an anti-graft watchdog of unduly influencing the awarding of government contracts.\nThe Guptas and Zuma deny wrongdoing and say they are victims of a politically motivated witch-hunt. The Guptas and their companies have not been charged with any crime.\nReporting by Nqobile Dludla; editing by Jason Neely\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-01-12T22:07:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-12T18:21:07.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
