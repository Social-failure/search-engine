Saab and Embraer are partners in the development of the Gripen NG fighter.\n“We are concerned and contractually committed to maintaining control and confidentiality in the transfer of technology developed both by Saab and jointly” with Embraer, Jungmann said according to the ministry.\nU.S. planemaker Boeing proposed a tie-up with Embraer in December, but the plans have faced resistance from Brazil’s government, which has a so-called golden share, giving it a right to veto any change of control.\nJungmann has asked the Air Force as well as the Defense and Finance Ministries to keep Saab executives informed of any progress in talks between the companies, adding that any deal would mean building safeguards for Saab with its input.\nReporting by Marta Nogueira; Editing by Cynthia Osterman\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-26T02:21:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-26T02:31:30.058+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
