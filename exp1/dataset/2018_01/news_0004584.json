Revenues for the quarter were $415.8 million, up 7.7% from $386.1 million in the same year ago period. Net income in the quarter was $34.2 million ($1.67 per diluted share), compared to net income of $28.2 million ($1.38 per diluted share) in the first quarter of fiscal 2017.\nDuring our first quarter of fiscal 2018 we adopted Accounting Standards Update 2016-09 (ASU 2016-09), Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting . Under ASU 2016-09, excess tax benefits and deficiencies associated with employee share-based payments are no longer recognized as additional paid-in capital on the balance sheet but instead recognized directly to income tax expense or benefit in the income statement in the reporting period in which they occur. The net benefit in our first quarter to fully diluted earnings per share from the adoption of ASU 2016-09 was $0.07. The full year 2018 outlook provided by the Company in its October 2017 earnings release did not include any expected benefit from this change in accounting.\nSteven S. Sintros, UniFirst President and Chief Executive Officer said, “We are pleased with the overall results of our first quarter. With our Core Laundry Operations leading the way, all of our operating segments contributed to the positive top and bottom line results.”\nOur Core Laundry Operations produced first quarter revenues of $373.8 million, up 6.2% from those in the first quarter of the prior year. Adjusting for the estimated effect of acquisitions, primarily from the September 2016 purchase of Arrow Uniform, as well as a stronger Canadian dollar, Core Laundry revenues grew 4.5%. Core Laundry operating income was $46.4 million during the quarter, a 6.1% increase from the first quarter of the prior year. The Core Laundry operating margin in the first quarter of 2018 was 12.4%, consistent with the same period a year ago. The operating margin comparison was positively impacted by lower merchandise costs as a percentage of revenues as well as lower stock compensation expense compared to the first quarter a year ago. These positive comparisons were offset by higher costs related to healthcare claims, service and administrative payroll and legal and environmental contingencies.\nRevenues in the first quarter of fiscal 2018 for our Specialty Garments segment, which consists of nuclear decontamination and cleanroom operations, were $28.4 million, up 27.2% in the quarter compared to the same period a year ago. Operating income was $4.5 million compared to $1.2 million in the prior year first quarter. The year to year improvement was primarily due to increased outages and project-based activity in the US and Canada as well as gains from this segment's European operations. This segment’s results can vary significantly due to seasonality and the timing of reactor outages and projects.\nOur first quarter profit comparison to the prior period also benefited from Other Income which was $0.8 million higher than the same quarter a year ago, primarily the result of higher interest income.\nUniFirst continues to maintain a strong balance sheet with no long-term debt and significant cash balances. Cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments increased $24.3 million to $374.0 million at the end of the first quarter of fiscal 2018.\nOutlook\nMr. Sintros continued, “At this time, we expect that our fiscal 2018 revenues will be between $1.630 billion and $1.650 billion and full year diluted earnings per share will be between $5.10 and $5.30. This outlook includes the $0.07 per share impact of the adoption of ASU 2016-9 in our first quarter. Our outlook does not include any further tax benefits related to the adoption of this ASU for the remainder of the fiscal year. In addition, while we expect our future results to substantially benefit from the recent U.S. tax reform, our earnings per share guidance also does not reflect this impact as our analysis is preliminary.”\nConference Call Information\nUniFirst will hold a conference call today at 10:00 a.m. (ET) to discuss its quarterly financial results, business highlights and outlook.
