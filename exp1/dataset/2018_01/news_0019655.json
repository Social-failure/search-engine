There will be no creating of new taxes.”\nFrance’s central bank is predicting that GDP, which grew by around 1.8 percent last year, the strongest since 2011, will continue to expand at a roughly similar rate over the coming three years.\nReporting By Brian Love and Myriam Rivet; Editing by Luke Baker and Alison Williams\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-01-12T17:58:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-13T14:45:40.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
