Results for the first quarter of fiscal 2018 included after-tax charges of $14.1 million associated with restructuring actions in the access equipment and commercial segments as well as one-time discrete tax benefits of $6.5 million related to implementation of tax reform in the United States. Excluding these items, fiscal 2018 first quarter adjusted 1 net income was $64.0 million or $0.84 per diluted share. Comparisons in this news release are to the corresponding period of the prior year, unless otherwise noted.\nConsolidated net sales in the first quarter of fiscal 2018 were $1.59 billion, an increase of 30.9 percent compared to the first quarter of fiscal 2017. The Company reported double-digit percentage sales growth in the defense, access equipment and commercial segments.\nConsolidated operating income increased 103.9 percent to $73.8 million, or 4.7 percent of sales, in the first quarter of fiscal 2018 compared to $36.2 million, or 3.0 percent of sales, in the first quarter of fiscal 2017. The increase in operating income in the first quarter of fiscal 2018 was primarily a result of the impact of higher sales volume, offset in part by costs related to restructuring actions, increased material costs and adverse product mix. Excluding $18.6 million of pre-tax charges and operating inefficiencies related to restructuring actions in the access equipment and commercial segments, adjusted 1 operating income in the first quarter of fiscal 2018 was $92.4 million or 5.8 percent of sales.\n“I am pleased to report a positive start to fiscal 2018, with results that exceeded our expectations,” said Wilson R. Jones, president and chief executive officer of Oshkosh Corporation. “Strong orders in the quarter and strong backlogs exiting the quarter reflect the broader positive macroeconomic environment driving favorable conditions in many of our markets.\n“I am proud of the hard work and dedication of our Oshkosh team members that delivered these solid results. Sales grew in three of our four segments, and all four segments reported higher adjusted 1 operating income. We continue to identify opportunities to improve our execution and remain focused on delivering strong performance and shareholder value.\n“As a result of our positive start to the year, solid outlook and lower tax rate as a result of tax reform in the U.S., we are increasing our full year expectations for earnings per share and adjusted 1 earnings per share. We now expect full year earnings per share to be in a range of $4.75 to $5.20 and adjusted 1 earnings per share to be in a range of $5.00 to $5.45,” said Jones.\nFactors affecting first quarter results for the Company’s business segments included:\nAccess Equipment – Access equipment segment net sales increased 28.4 percent to $628.2 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2018. The increase in sales was due to improved demand for both aerial work platforms and telehandlers.\nAccess equipment segment operating income decreased 43.4 percent to $13.8 million, or 2.2 percent of sales, in the first quarter of fiscal 2018 compared to $24.4 million, or 5.0 percent of sales, in the first quarter of fiscal 2017. Excluding charges and operating inefficiencies associated with previously announced restructuring actions of $16.1 million, adjusted 1 operating income was $29.9 million, or 4.8 percent of sales, in the first quarter of fiscal 2018. The increase in adjusted 1 operating income in the first quarter of fiscal 2018 compared to operating income in the first quarter of fiscal 2017 was primarily due to the impact of higher sales volume, offset in part by higher material costs and, to a lesser extent, higher legal and inventory reserve adjustments, unfavorable customer mix and an adverse foreign exchange impact.\nDefense – Defense segment net sales for the first quarter of fiscal 2018 increased 67.6 percent to $493.5 million. The increase in sales was due to the ramp up of sales to the U.S. government under the Joint Light Tactical Vehicle (JLTV) program and international Mine Resistant Ambush Protected-All Terrain Vehicle (M-ATV) sales.\nDefense segment operating income increased 173.9 percent to $65.2 million, or 13.2 percent of sales, in the first quarter of fiscal 2018 compared to $23.8 million, or 8.1 percent of sales, in the first quarter of fiscal 2017. The increase in operating income was due to the impact of higher sales volume and improved manufacturing performance, offset in part by an adverse product mix.\nFire & Emergency – Fire & emergency segment net sales for the first quarter of fiscal 2018 decreased 1.5 percent to $229.1 million. The decrease in sales was due to lower airport products international volume, largely offset by higher fire apparatus sales.\nFire & emergency segment operating income increased 47.6 percent to $25.1 million, or 11.0 percent of sales, in the first quarter of fiscal 2018 compared to $17.0 million, or 7.3 percent of sales, in the first quarter of fiscal 2017. The increase in operating income was a result of improved pricing and improved manufacturing performance, offset in part by higher selling, general and administrative expenses.\nCommercial – Commercial segment net sales increased 21.2 percent to $241.4 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2018. The increase in sales was primarily due to higher concrete placement and refuse collection vehicle unit volume. Fiscal 2017 first quarter sales were negatively impacted by an atypical order pattern.\nCommercial segment operating income increased 80.4 percent to $8.3 million, or 3.4 percent of sales, in the first quarter of fiscal 2018 compared to $4.6 million, or 2.3 percent of sales, in the first quarter of fiscal 2017. Excluding restructuring-related charges of $2.5 million, adjusted 1 operating income was $10.8 million, or 4.5 percent of sales, in the first quarter of fiscal 2018. The increase in operating income was largely a result of the impact of higher sales volume.\nCorporate – Corporate operating costs increased $5.0 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2018 to $38.6 million due primarily to higher new product development spending, increased share-based compensation expense and the timing of costs.\nInterest Expense Net of Interest Income – Interest expense net of interest income decreased $0.2 million to $13.7 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2018.\nProvision for Income Taxes – The Company recorded income tax expense of $4.7 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2018, or 7.8 percent of pre-tax income, compared to $5.2 million, or 21.8 percent of pre-tax income, in the first quarter of fiscal 2017. Excluding the tax impact of restructuring-related charges of $4.5 million as well as one-time discrete tax benefits of $6.5 million related to implementation of tax reform, adjusted 1 income tax expense in the first quarter of fiscal 2018 was $15.7 million, or 19.8 percent of adjusted 1 pre-tax income. The Company recorded $3.8 million of discrete tax benefits in the first quarter of fiscal 2018 largely related to favorable share-based compensation tax benefits. The Company recorded $2.8 million of discrete tax benefits in the first quarter of fiscal 2017 largely related to state tax matters.\nU.S. tax legislation lowered the federal corporate statutory tax rate for income earned in the U.S. from 35 percent to 21 percent effective January 1, 2018. For the first quarter of fiscal 2018, the Company applied its fiscal 2018 blended federal statutory tax rate of 24.5 percent.\nShare Repurchases –The Company deployed cash of $63.7 million to repurchase 748,000 shares of Common Stock in the first quarter of fiscal 2018. Share repurchases did not have a material impact on earnings per share in the first quarter of fiscal 2018.\nFiscal 2018 Expectations\nAs a result of the positive start to the fiscal year, improved demand outlook for access equipment and the impact of tax reform, the Company is raising its fiscal 2018 full year outlook. The Company now expects consolidated sales to be $7.1 billion to $7.3 billion, an increase of $200 million from the Company’s previous sales estimate range of $6.9 billion to $7.1 billion.\nThe Company now expects its fiscal 2018 consolidated operating income to be $520 million to $570 million. Excluding anticipated charges and operating inefficiencies for announced restructuring actions in the access equipment and commercial segments, the Company expects its fiscal 2018 adjusted 1 operating income to be $550 million to $600 million, compared to its previous estimated adjusted operating income range of $515 million to $565 million.\nThe Company now expects its fiscal 2018 diluted earnings per share to be in the range of $4.75 to $5.20. Excluding anticipated charges and operating inefficiencies for announced restructuring actions in the access equipment and commercial segments as well as the impact of one-time discrete items associated with tax reform in the U.S., the Company expects its fiscal 2018 adjusted 1 diluted earnings per share to be in the range of $5.00 to $5.45, compared to the prior adjusted diluted earnings per share estimated range of $4.25 to $4.65.\nDividend Announcement\nThe Company’s Board of Directors today declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.24 per share of Common Stock. The dividend will be payable on February 26, 2018, to shareholders of record as of February 12, 2018.\nConference Call\nThe Company will comment on its fiscal 2018 first quarter earnings and its full-year fiscal 2018 outlook during a conference call at 9:00 a.m. EST this morning.
