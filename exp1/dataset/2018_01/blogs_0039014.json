I pick the highest tip every time. Somehow my rating is getting better. I'm not sure if it's aggressive tipping. Everybody, tip aggressively.\"\nA good rating has its benefits, since you're more likely to get a driver with a high score, too.\n\"When you get a 4.8 or 4.9 rated driver, know that that driver has passed an array of background checks and has a history,\" Khosrowshahi said. \"That's more information than you have if you hail a cab in New York City.\"\nKhosrowshahi said he wants to introduce a higher level of service for riders with better ratings, too, aside from just offering nicer cars.\nCNBC's Andrew Ross Sorkin contributed to this report.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-23T16:54:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-23T17:15:50.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
