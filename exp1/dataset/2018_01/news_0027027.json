They also called for him to be held in “safe custody”, which can imply indefinite imprisonment.\nThe prosecutor also sought the confiscation and destruction of Madsen’s submarine, one of three the inventor built and one of the largest privately built in the world. It can carry eight people and weighs 40 tonnes fully equipped.\nThe prosecutor has asked for Madsen to be held in custody until his trial begins on March 8.\nOn October 5, police said they found images “which we presume to be real” of women being strangled and decapitated on the hard drive on Madsen’s computer in a laboratory he ran.\nReporting by Julie Astrid Thomsen; Editing by Jacob Gronholt-Pedersen and Richard Balmforth\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-01-16T20:37:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-17T19:55:44.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
