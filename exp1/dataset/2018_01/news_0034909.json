Miller’s power-play goal at 12:20 was followed 39 seconds later by Marchessault finding the net.\nDarling stopped only five of eight shots before Cam Ward, who played a night earlier, was summoned to the ice. Darling’s record dropped to 9-13-6, adding to a disappointing recent stretch for the player who was supposed to claim the No. 1 goaltending role.\nWard allowed two goals on 25 shots in his relief effort.\nVegas has posted more shots than its opponent in seven consecutive games.\nSince mid-December, the Hurricanes also have taken 8-1 and 7-1 losses, but those results were on the road.\nThe Hurricanes have lost four consecutive home games, going 0-3-1 on home ice this month.\nThis was the only home game for the Hurricanes between their five-day break and the upcoming All-Star weekend.\n--Field Level Media\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-01-22T10:12:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-22T20:39:08.001+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
