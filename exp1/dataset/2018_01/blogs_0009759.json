Richard Burr , R-N.C., and Mark Warner , D-Va., NBC News reported Wednesday, citing a senate aide. \nWray and Rosenstein were seen leaving the Hart Senate Office Building. Thorp tweet \nBurr is the chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, and Warner is the ranking member. The subject of the meeting was not immediately clear. \nWray was confirmed as FBI director last year, replacing Andrew McCabe, who took over as acting director following President Donald Trump 's May firing of James Comey . Rosenstein, meanwhile, appointed former FBI director Robert Mueller as special counsel in the Russia probe after Trump fired Comey. Attorney General Jeff Sessions recused himself from the Russia investigation early in 2017. \nNBC News' Alex Moe later reported that Wray and Rosenstein also met with Democratic Rep. Adam Schiff , the ranking member on the House Intelligence Committee, earlier this morning, citing a person with direct knowledge of the meeting.
