It’s useful to have these experienced guys around camp and to have them included and to work with them. \nAlun Wyn Jones will captain the side but veterans Luke Charteris, Gethin Jenkins and Jamie Roberts missed out along with injured back-row forwards Sam Warburton and Dan Lydiate. \nWales won two of their four November internationals against Georgia and South Africa, losing to New Zealand and Australia. \nGatland’s side face Scotland in their opening Six Nations campaign in Cardiff on Feb. 3. \nSquad: \nBacks \nAled Davies (Scarlets), Gareth Davies (Scarlets), Rhys Webb (Ospreys), Gareth Anscombe (Cardiff Blues), Dan Biggar (Ospreys), Rhys Patchell (Scarlets), Rhys Priestland (Bath), Hadleigh Parkes (Scarlets), Owen Watkin (Ospreys), Owen Williams (Gloucester), Scott Williams (Scarlets), Josh Adams (Worcester Warriors), Hallam Amos (Dragons), Alex Cuthbert (Cardiff Blues), Steff Evans (Scarlets), Leigh Halfpenny (Scarlets), George North (Northampton Saints), Liam Williams (Saracens) \nForwards \nRob Evans (Scarlets), Wyn Jones (Scarlets), Nicky Smith (Ospreys), Scott Baldwin (Ospreys), Elliot Dee (Dragons), Ken Owens (Scarlets), Tomas Francis (Exeter Chiefs), Samson Lee (Scarlets), Dillon Lewis (Cardiff Blues), Adam Beard (Ospreys), Bradley Davies (Ospreys), Seb Davies (Cardiff Blues, Cory Hill (Dragons), Alun Wyn Jones (captain, Ospreys), James Davies (Scarlets), Taulupe Faletau (Bath), Ellis Jenkins (Cardiff Blues), Ross Moriarty (Gloucester), Josh Navidi (Cardiff Blues), Aaron Shingler (Scarlets), Justin Tipuric (Ospreys) (Reporting by Aditi Prakash in Bengaluru, editing by Ed Osmond)", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-16T14:08:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-16T14:41:11.001+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
