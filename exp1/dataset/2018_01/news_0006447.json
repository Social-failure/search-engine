VW is due to publish official 2017 group sales data on Jan. 17 and will release core financial results in late February. \nIn 2016, the first full year after VW’s emissions test-cheating “Dieselgate” scandal, group sales rose 3.8 percent to a record 10.3 million cars, helped by a double-digit increase in China and gains in Europe. \nToyota said last month it expected to sell 10.35 million cars worldwide in 2017 across its Toyota, Lexus, Daihatsu and Hino brands, up 2 percent from 2016, and 10.5 million this year.
