I have been so honoured to bring my shows to the public for the past 50 years,” Diamond said in the statement, offering apologies to those who purchased tickets to his upcoming shows. \nDiamond, known for hits including “Sweet Caroline” and “Cracklin’ Rosie,” said he plans to remain active in song writing and recording.

You will always have my appreciation for your support and encouragement,” Diamond said. \n“This ride has been ‘so good, so good, so good’ thanks to you,” he said.
