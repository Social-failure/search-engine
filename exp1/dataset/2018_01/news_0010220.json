We got stuck once and managed to get going again,” Loeb told the Dakar.com website before retiring.\n”We got to a crest where another car was stuck. We were following Nasser (al-Attiyah) and saw him go over, so we did the same, but I hadn’t realized there was a hole behind the crest. And, bam, we went right into the hole.\nDakar Rally - 2018 Peru-Bolivia-Argentina Dakar rally - 40th Dakar Edition stage four, San Juan de Marcona to San Juan de Marcona - January 9, 2018.

Argentina’s Kevin Benevides was in second place, a minute behind the leader.\nThursday’s sixth stage, with a 313km timed special section, runs from the city of Arequipa and up to the shores of Lake Titicaca before ending in La Paz.\nReporting by Alan Baldwin in London, editing by Ed Osmond\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-10T19:53:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-10T20:12:59.081+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
