My dad told me... ‘I had three more jobs I didn’t know I had’,” he added. \n”Of course I slightly feel people over react and stuff. You know, like, was it King Edmund VI? I mean, yeah, it is what it is basically. \n“The attention goes with the territory of doing well. The top guys like Roger (Federer)... they have been doing it their whole life. They crack on and embrace it.” \nCar lover Edmund, who moved to Yorkshire from South Africa when he was three, said he will not be going out to splash any of his cash and won’t be buying Ferrari. \n“I have a Jaguar deal, so I can‘t!” he said. \nWhile the media spotlight might take some getting used to, Edmund says he felt like he belonged on the big stage. \n“Played a lot of tough matches. Won some tough matches. Beat good players,” he said. “This type of tournament just gives you the bug to want more. Once you get a taste, it’s like, yeah, I want more of this.” ($1 = 0.6990 pounds) (Reporting by Martyn Herman, editing by Pritha Sarkar)", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-25T17:16:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-25T17:35:07.003+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
