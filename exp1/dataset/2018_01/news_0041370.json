Earnings for the fourth quarter were $12.33 million, or $0.20 per diluted share, versus $19.0 million, or $0.31 per diluted share, in fourth quarter 2016. Earnings in the fourth quarter of 2017 included an expense of $10.11 million related to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 and after-tax acquisition-related expenses of $0.43 million. The impact from tax legislation on fourth quarter 2017 earnings was primarily attributable to revaluation of deferred tax assets at the lower statutory tax rate.\nExcluding merger-related expenses and adjustments related to tax reform, earnings for the quarter ended December 31, 2017 were $22.87 million (non-GAAP) compared to $18.55 million (non-GAAP) in 2016. Fully diluted earnings per share, excluding merger-related expenses and adjustments related to tax reform, were $0.37 (non-GAAP) compared to $0.30 (non-GAAP) for 2016.\nEarnings for the full year period were a record $87.66 million, as compared to the $67.25 million reported in 2016, representing a 30.35% increase. Fully diluted earnings per share were $1.41 per share compared to $1.18 per share for 2016.\nExcluding merger-related expenses, purchase accounting adjustments, and adjustments related to tax reform, earnings for the year ended December 31, 2017 were $97.18 million (non-GAAP) compared to $80.15 million (non-GAAP) in 2016. Fully diluted earnings per share, excluding the above-mentioned items, were $1.56 (non-GAAP) compared to $1.41 (non-GAAP) for 2016.\nThe Bank’s quarterly dividend was increased to $0.14 per share beginning in the second quarter of 2017 resulting in total dividends of $0.55 per share for 2017, an increase of 7.8% over 2016. On an annualized basis, the current annual dividend rate is $0.56 per share.\n“We are pleased to report our 18th consecutive year of record annual earnings,” said G. Robert Aston, Jr., Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. “With 20.09% revenue growth, representing an increase of $75.14 million, and a return on average assets of 1.05%, our financial performance has enabled us to reward our shareholders while building a strong pathway to the future. Our closing on the affiliation with Paragon Bank is scheduled to occur on January 26, 2018 and will provide a substantial entry into the robust Raleigh and Charlotte, North Carolina markets where where Paragon recorded loan growth of over 20% last year.”\nThe following items affected comparability of our fourth quarter 2017 earnings (in thousands):\nThree Months Ended Three Months Ended December 31, 2017 December 31, 2016 (dollars in thousands, except per share amounts) Net Income Diluted\nEarnings\nPer Share Net Income Diluted\nEarnings\nPer Share Net income (GAAP) $ 12,333 $ 0.20 $ 18,996 $ 0.31 After tax acquisition-related expenses 428 0.01 (443 ) (0.01 ) Income tax expense related to tax reform legislation 10,112 0.16 — — Net income, excluding certain items affecting comparability (Non-GAAP) $ 22,873 $ 0.37 $ 18,553 $ 0.30 2017 Performance Highlights\n• Total revenues were $449.24 million, an increase of $75.14 million, or 20.09% from 2016\nTaxable equivalent net interest margin was 3.51%, including accretion of 15 basis points, compared to 3.44%, including accretion of 11 basis points, for 2016 Property management fee revenue increased $6.81 million or 53.73% Residential mortgage banking income increased $17.06 million, or 29.02% Insurance segment total revenue increased 10.44% to $60.20 million\n• Loans held for investment increased $139.74 million, or 2.41%, from December 31, 2016\n• Total deposits were $6.45 billion, an increase of $413.02 million, or 6.84%, from 2016\nNoninterest bearing deposits increased by 10.79%, to $2.16 billion, representing 33.46% of total deposits Total cost of deposits increased to 0.45% at December 31, 2017 from 0.40% at December 31, 2016\n• Issued $250.0 million of fixed to variable rate 10-year subordinated notes at a fixed rate of 4.50% for the first five years\nIssuance resulted in a reduction of 7 basis points to net interest margin Treated as Tier 2 capital for regulatory purposes at December 31, 2017\n• Asset quality showed continued strength\nNonperforming assets declined to $28.09 million, or 0.33% of total assets compared to $37.60 million, or 0.47%, at December 31, 2016 Nonperforming loans were 0.08% of period end loans Foreclosed property decreased to $19.82 million\n• Strategic acquisitions\nOn April 11, 2017, the Company acquired Railey Mountain Lake Vacations, LLC, an independent resort property management company at Deep Creek Lake, Maryland On April 27, 2017, the Company announced the signing of agreement to acquire Paragon Commercial Corporation (“Paragon”) and its wholly owned bank subsidiary, Paragon Commercial Bank, a Raleigh, North Carolina-based bank with three banking offices servicing Raleigh, Cary, and Charlotte, North Carolina.

Excluding merger-related expenses and adjustments related to tax reform, earnings were $22.87 million (non-GAAP) compared to $18.55 million (non-GAAP) in 2016, reflecting growth in net interest income and noninterest income as compared to the prior year period.\nPerformance Highlights\n• Total revenues were $109.14 million, a $7.47 million, or 7.35%, increase from fourth quarter 2016\nTaxable equivalent net interest margin was 3.41%, including accretion of 9 basis points, compared to 3.52%, including accretion of 11 basis points in fourth quarter 2016 Property management fee revenue increased $1.57 million, or 134.82% Insurance segment total revenue increased $2.50 million to $14.18 million\nNet Interest Income\nNet interest income increased to $65.66 million, a $3.51 million, or 5.65%, increase from fourth quarter 2016. The primary driver was the growth in average earning assets, which increased $604.12 million, or 8.48%, while tax-equivalent net interest margin decreased to 3.41% in the current quarter from 3.52% in fourth quarter 2016. The subordinated note issuance in July 2017 resulted in additional interest expense of $2.88 million in fourth quarter 2017 and a temporary reduction of 15 basis points to net interest margin, as the Company continues the process of leveraging the proceeds into earning assets. Accretion income added $1.47 million, or 9 basis points, to margin in the current quarter as compared to $2.34 million, or 15 basis points, in the fourth quarter of 2016.\nNoninterest Income\nNoninterest income, excluding gains or losses on investment securities, was $43.48 million for the fourth quarter of 2017, an increase of $3.96 million, or 10.02%, from the fourth quarter of 2016. In our Realty segment, residential mortgage banking income decreased $0.83 million, or 4.54%, from the fourth quarter of 2016 primarily due to lower production volumes. Mortgage production was $837.32 million in fourth quarter 2017, a decrease from fourth quarter 2016 production of $1.01 billion. Insurance commissions and other title fees increased $2.29 million, or 23.33%, primarily due to an increase in contingent commission revenue combined with the acquisition of an insurance agency in August 2017. Additionally, real estate brokerage and property management income increased $1.90 million, or 64.89%, from fourth quarter 2016 primarily due to our acquisition of a resort property management company in second quarter 2017.\nNoninterest Expense\nNoninterest expense increased by $0.83 million, or 1.13%, from the fourth quarter of 2016. The predominant driver was an increase in noninterest expense of $2.30 million related to the Deep Creek and insurance agency acquisitions, mainly in salaries and benefits expense. The decrease was partially offset by lower salaries and benefits expense primarily due to a decrease in profit sharing expense, which included a reversal of $0.65 million due to a change in estimate of previously accrued employee incentive compensation unearned for the full year.\nFourth Quarter 2017 Earnings Compared to Third Quarter 2017\nNet income for the fourth quarter was $12.33 million, or $0.20 per diluted share, versus $27.15 million, or $0.44 per diluted share, in third quarter 2017. Excluding merger-related expenses and adjustments related to tax reform, earnings were $22.87 million (non-GAAP) compared to $27.50 million (non-GAAP) in third quarter 2017, primarily reflecting the seasonality in our Realty segment.\nPerformance Highlights\n• Total revenues were $109.14 million compared to $115.34 million in the third quarter of 2017\nTaxable equivalent net interest margin was 3.41%, including accretion of 9 basis points, compared to 3.43%, including accretion of 12 basis points, in the third quarter of 2017 Noninterest income decreased $5.94 million due to seasonality in our Insurance and Realty segments Noninterest expense decreased $0.53 million, or 0.71%\n• Total loans held for investment increased $36.49 million, or 2.43% on an annualized basis, from September 30, 2017\nNet Interest Income\nOn a linked quarter basis, net interest income decreased slightly by $0.26 million or 0.39%, in fourth quarter 2017 versus third quarter 2017, while tax-equivalent net interest margin was 3.41% versus 3.43% for the third quarter of 2017. The decrease in net interest income was primarily due to higher time deposit costs and interest expense on the newly issued subordinated notes, combined with seasonally lower loans held for sale average balances. The decrease was partially offset by higher interest income from loans and investment securities. Accretion income added $1.47 million, or 9 basis points, to margin in the current quarter, as compared to $2.36 million, or 12 basis points, in the linked quarter.\nNoninterest Income\nIn comparison to the third quarter of 2017, noninterest income decreased $5.94 million, or 12.02%. Residential mortgage banking income decreased by $1.55 million, or 8.12%, from the third quarter of 2017 primarily due to a seasonal decrease in mortgage production of $110.34 million, from $947.66 million in third quarter 2017 to $837.32 million in fourth quarter 2017. A decrease of $5.22 million in real estate brokerage and property management income from the linked quarter reflected the seasonal nature of those businesses. Insurance commission income was flat as a seasonal decrease in insurance policy renewals was offset by an increase in contingent commission revenue.\nNoninterest Expense\nNoninterest expense decreased by $0.53 million, or 0.71%, from the third quarter of 2017. The primary driver was a decrease in salaries and benefits expenses of $0.99 million, primarily due to a reduction in profit sharing expense, which was partially offset by an increase in expenses related to employee retirement plans.\nNoninterest Income % Change Q4 Q4 Q3 Q4 17 vs. Q4 17 vs. (dollars in thousands) 2017 2016 2017 Q4 16 Q3 17 Residential mortgage banking income, net $ 17,537 $ 18,096 $ 19,087 (3.09 )% (8.12 )% Insurance commissions and other title fees and income, net 12,115 9,823 12,116 23.33 % (0.01 )% Real estate brokerage and property management, net 4,823 2,925 10,042 64.89 % (51.97 )% Service charges on deposit accounts 2,809 2,535 2,670 10.81 % 5.21 % Credit card merchant fees, net 1,204 1,135 1,388 6.08 % (13.26 )% Bank owned life insurance 1,941 2,377 1,425 (18.34 )% 36.21 % Other income 3,048 2,621 2,688 16.29 % 13.39 % Subtotal before gain on investment securities 43,477 39,512 49,416 10.03 % (12.02 )% Net gain on investment securities — 6 — N/M N/M Total noninterest income $ 43,477 $ 39,518 $ 49,416 10.02 % (12.02 )%\nNoninterest Expense % Change Q4 Q4 Q3 Q4 17 vs. Q4 17 vs. (dollars in thousands) 2017 2016 2017 Q4 16 Q3 17 Salaries and benefits $ 42,480 $ 43,071 $ 43,467 (1.37 )% (2.27 )% Occupancy expense 6,878 6,885 6,635 (0.10 )% 3.66 % Furniture and equipment 3,456 3,378 3,710 2.31 % (6.85 )% Acquisition-related expenses 526 (707 ) 466 (174.40 )% 12.88 % Other expenses 20,320 20,207 19,908 0.56 % 2.07 % Total noninterest expense $ 73,660 $ 72,834 $ 74,186 1.13 % (0.71 )%\nSegment Results $ Change (in thousands) Q4 Q4 Q3 Q4 17 vs. Q4 17 vs. Segment Net Income (Loss) 2017 2016 2017 Q4 16 Q3 17 Banking $ 11,530 $ 17,931 $ 22,569 $ (6,401 ) $ (11,039 ) Realty (224 ) 673 3,445 (897 ) (3,669 ) Insurance 1,027 392 1,136 635 (109 ) Total net income $ 12,333 $ 18,996 $ 27,150 $ (6,663 ) $ (14,817 ) Fourth Quarter 2017 Compared to Fourth Quarter 2016\nBanking\nNet income for the three months ended December 31, 2017 for the Banking segment was $11.53 million, decreasing $6.40 million, or 35.70%, from comparative 2016. This reduction in net income was primarily due to a significant increase of $12.96 million in the provision for income tax expense, mostly due to the tax reform legislation. Partially offsetting this increase was a rise in net interest income of $3.55 million due to an increase in earning assets and a slight increase in noninterest income of $0.53 million. A reduction in the provision for loan losses of $0.93 million and a decrease in noninterest expenses of $1.53 million also partially offset the decrease in net income.\nRealty\nFor the three months ended December 31, 2017, the Realty segment results decreased to a loss of $0.22 million from income of $0.67 million for fourth quarter 2016. The reduction was driven by a decrease in residential mortgage banking income of $0.83 million, or 4.54%, an increase in total expenses of $1.13 million, and increase of $0.81 million in the provision for income tax expense. The Deep Creek acquisition resulted in an increase in property management fees of $1.57 million and an increase in noninterest expense of $1.74 million.\nInsurance\nThe Insurance segment had net income of $1.03 million for the three months ended December 31, 2017, an increase of $0.64 million compared to fourth quarter 2016. The increase in net income was driven by higher property and casualty insurance commission income and contingency and bonus revenue.\nFourth Quarter 2017 Compared to Third Quarter 2017\nBanking\nEarnings decreased by $11.04 million, or 48.91% from the third quarter of 2017 as an increase in revenue was overcome by an increase in the provision for income tax expense of $10.51 million, primarily related to the tax reform legislation, and an increase in noninterest expense of $1.44 million.\nRealty\nNet income in the Realty segment decreased by $3.67 million from the linked quarter ended September 30, 2017, due to seasonal decreases in the Bank's mortgage, real estate brokerage, and resort property management businesses. The seasonal decrease in revenue was partially offset by a decline in operating expenses during the current quarter.\nInsurance\nNet income decreased slightly by $0.11 million from the third quarter of 2017 due to an increase in operating expenses during the current quarter. The increase was mostly offset by higher net revenues as an increase in contingent commission revenue was only partially offset by the seasonal decrease in fourth quarter policy renewals.\nBalance Sheet\nAt December 31, 2017, total Bank assets reached $8.52 billion, an increase of $0.55 billion, or 6.88%, over December 31, 2016.\nLoans\n% Change Q4 Q4 Q3 Q4 17 vs. Q4 17 vs. (dollars in thousands) 2017 2016 2017 Q4 16 Q3 17 Construction and land development $ 930,426 $ 826,027 $ 880,655 12.64 % 5.65 % Commercial real estate - investment related properties 1,344,774 1,322,466 1,336,277 1.69 % 0.64 % Commercial real estate - owner occupied 938,767 928,846 966,986 1.07 % (2.92 )% Multifamily real estate 198,720 222,791 185,323 (10.80 )% 7.23 % 1-4 family residential real estate 1,217,349 1,215,823 1,239,886 0.13 % (1.82 )% Commercial and industrial business loans 1,087,157 1,089,539 1,084,555 (0.22 )% 0.24 % Consumer loans and other 229,772 201,729 216,797 13.90 % 5.98 % Total $ 5,946,965 $ 5,807,221 $ 5,910,479 2.41 % 0.62 % The Bank’s loan portfolio ended the period at $5.95 billion representing an increase of 2.41%, or $139.74 million, from December 31, 2016, and an increase of $36.49 million, or 0.62%, from September 30, 2017.\nDeposits\n% Change Q4 Q4 Q3 Q4 17 vs. Q4 17 vs. (dollars in thousands) 2017 2016 2017 Q4 16 Q3 17 Noninterest-bearing demand $ 2,157,338 $ 1,947,312 $ 2,212,047 10.79 % (2.47 )% Interest-bearing: Demand and money market accounts 2,225,211 2,263,894 2,253,746 (1.71 )% (1.27 )% Savings 315,889 319,611 320,028 (1.16 )% (1.29 )% Certificates of deposits 1,749,782 1,504,380 1,762,641 16.31 % (0.73 )% Total $ 6,448,220 $ 6,035,197 $ 6,548,462 6.84 % (1.53 )% The Bank experienced solid deposit growth with total deposits increasing to $6.45 billion, up $0.41 billion, or 6.84%, from December 31, 2016.

The Company's management uses these non-GAAP financial measures in their analysis of the Company's performance. These measures typically adjust GAAP performance measures to exclude the effects of the amortization of intangibles and include the tax benefit associated with revenue items that are tax-exempt, as well as adjust income available to common shareholders for certain significant activities or transactions that are infrequent in nature. Since the presentation of these GAAP performance measures and their impact differ between companies, management believes presentations of these non-GAAP financial measures provide useful supplemental information that is essential to a proper understanding of the operating results of the Company’s core businesses. These non-GAAP disclosures should not be viewed as a substitute for operating results determined in accordance with GAAP, nor are they necessarily comparable to non-GAAP performance measures that may be presented by other companies. Reconciliations of GAAP to non-GAAP disclosures are included as tables at the end of this release.\nForward-Looking Statements:\nCertain statements contained in this release constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of U.S. federal securities laws. These forward-looking statements speak only as of the date of this release, are based on current expectations, and involve a number of assumptions.

You should not place undue reliance on forward-looking statements, which are subject to assumptions that are subject to change. TowneBank’s ability to predict results, or the actual effect of future plans or strategies, is inherently uncertain.
