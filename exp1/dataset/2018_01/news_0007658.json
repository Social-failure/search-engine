Although the Israeli air force chief last August disclosed that his corps had struck in Syria around 100 times, Israel’s policy is generally not to confirm or deny such operations.\nIsrael has pledged to prevent Syrian territory being used for Iran to set up bases or transfer high-quality weaponry to Lebanon’s Hezbollah group, which has been helping Damascus beat back a six-year-old rebellion.\nIn its statement, the Syrian army repeated previous warnings of serious repercussions for the strikes and repeated its past accusation that Israel was using attacks to support militant groups in Syria.\nReporting By Angus McDowall; Additional reporting by Dan Williams in Jerusalem; Editing by Paul Tait and Robin Pomeroy\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-09T08:49:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-09T09:42:53.091+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
