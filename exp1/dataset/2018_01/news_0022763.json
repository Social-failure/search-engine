That takes time,” GMB General Secretary Tim Roache told BBC radio. \nOver 90 percent of Carillion’s private sector service customers have said they will provide funding for now to allow the company’s official receiver to retain employees on those contracts, Britain’s Insolvency Service said on Wednesday.

REUTERS/Simon Dawson \nThe demise of Carillion, the biggest British corporate failure in a decade, has left its 43,000 employees in limbo, banks with losses of over $1.3 billion and hundreds of suppliers likely to receive almost none of the money owed to them. \nJust as May grapples with Brexit, Carillion’s fate has pulled her into a debate about whether the legacy of late former prime minister Margaret Thatcher, of the state paying private companies to provide essential public services, is right.

It’s a broken system,” Jeremy Corbyn said during a weekly question session with the prime minister.
