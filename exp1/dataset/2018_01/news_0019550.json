But, there are some significant storm clouds over the longer term,” Dudley, who is set to step down in mid-2018, told a Wall Street forum.\nThe tax cuts, he said, “will come at a cost. After all, there is no such thing as a free lunch.”\nReporting by Jonathan Spicer Editing by Chizu Nomiyama\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-01-12T04:40:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-12T18:24:53.010+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
