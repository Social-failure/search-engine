The announcement clears the potential purchase of the jets by the Belgian government. If Belgium elects to buy the F-35, it would become the fourth foreign military sales customer for the F-35 following South Korea in 2014.\nThe F-35 is a vital product for Lockheed, accounting for about a quarter of its total revenue. During the third quarter, sales at Lockheed’s aeronautics business increased 14 percent to $4.7 billion, pulled higher by F-35 sales.\nReporting by David Alexander and Chris Sanders; Editing by Eric Walsh and Rosalba O'Brien\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-20T00:44:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-20T01:11:04.012+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
