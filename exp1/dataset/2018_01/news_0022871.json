(NASDAQ: JCTCF) today reported financial results for the first quarter of fiscal 2018 ended November 30, 2017.\nSales for the first quarter of fiscal 2018 totaled $9.4 million compared to sales of $10.4 million for the first quarter of fiscal 2017. Net income was $322,433, or $0.14 per share, compared to $485,920, or $0.21 per share, in the year-ago quarter.\nDuring the current quarter, the Company was advised by a customer for whom we annually source and supply a \"Black Friday\" item that is not related to our core products that they had experienced returns due to breakage. Since it was a child's product, we jointly decided with the customer to immediately stop selling the product and take the added precaution of destroying all remaining inventory. In addition, we advised through direct email as well as public announcement that we were aware of a defect that may or may not be apparent on the products consumers had purchased, but that they could return the item to the retailer for refund. We also advised the Consumer Products Safety Commission of our voluntary actions and are awaiting further guidance. This entire incident applied to only one retail source and one product, but it caused significant impact on our first quarter results as we recognized the financial costs of this incident during the period. Based on our continuing analysis, we anticipate limited additional costs related to the issue.\nAs of November 30, 2017, the Company's cash position was approximately $5.6 million, and there was no borrowing against its $3.0 million line of credit. The Company has historically utilized its cash position by implementing share repurchase programs as an effective method of enhancing shareholder value, and the Board of Directors will consider implementing new share repurchase plans in the future.\nJewett-Cameron Trading Company is a holding company that, through its subsidiaries, operates out of facilities located in North Plains, Oregon. Jewett-Cameron Company's business consists of the manufacturing and distribution of patented and patent pending specialty metal products, wholesale distribution of wood products, seed processing and sales, and sales of industrial tools and clamps. The Company's brands include Lucky Dog, Animal House and AKC licensed products in the expanding pet market; fencing products under the Adjust-A-Gates, Fit-Right, Perimeter Patrol, and INFINITY Euro fence systems brands; Early Start, Spring Gardner, and Weatherguard for greenhouses; and TrueShade for patio umbrellas, furniture covers and canopies.
