It projected 2018 revenue of $32 billion, $1 billion higher than the current Wall Street consensus.\n“We expected an upward 2018 guidance revision, but not of this magnitude,” said Jefferies analyst Jeffrey Holford, calling it “jaw dropping” in a research note.\nAbbVie forecast first-quarter adjusted earnings of $1.70 to $1.79 per share, well above Wall Street estimates of $1.50, according to Thomson Reuters data.\nChief Executive Officer Rick Gonzalez said the benefits of U.S. tax reform, continued growth of Humira, the world’s top-selling prescription medicine, and surprising strength of Mavyret for hepatitis C, and other new products led to the new profit outlook.\nWith a cheaper corporate tax rate and access to cash overseas that can now be spent in the United States, Gonzalez said he planned to talk to the board about accelerating the rate it raises its dividend and boosting share buybacks.\n“I sleep well at night knowing how well we are performing” and how things look for the future, Gonzalez said on a conference call.\nSatisfied with the near-term pipeline, he said AbbVie would be in the market for deals that could help drive growth in the 2023-2025 time frame.\nThe company, whose stock has been on a tear, now has a market value of about $172.6 billion, surpassing industry stalwart Merck & Co Inc ( MRK.N ) at about $167.2 billion.\nAbbVie projected an adjusted effective 2018 tax rate of 9 percent, gradually growing to 13 percent over five years.\nThe company plans to invest about $2.5 billion over the next five years in U.S. capital projects and consider expanding facilities in the United States.\nIt also plans to spend $350 million on charitable contributions, including helping to rebuild hurricane ravaged Puerto Rico, $750 million in accelerated pension funding, and an undisclosed amount for enhanced compensation for employees.\nSales of Humira, which could soon begin facing competition from biosimilars, rose 14 percent to $4.89 billion for the quarter, helped by price increases.\nThe company has forecast Humira sales reaching $21 billion by 2020.\nImbruvica, the leukemia drug AbbVie shares with Johnson & Johnson ( JNJ.N ), had sales of $708 million.\nAbbVie said it expects to file for U.S. approval of its other cancer drug Venclexta for acute myeloid leukemia later this year, noting the approval could come two years ahead of its initial expectations.\nBased on promising data, the company also sees Venclexta in combination with Roche’s ( ROG.S ) Rituxan becoming a new chemotherapy-free standard treatment for relapsed chronic lymphocytic leukemia.\nExcluding items, AbbVie earned $1.48 per share for the quarter, topping the analyst average estimate by 4 cents.\nReporting by Bill Berkrot in New York and Tamara Mathias in Bengaluru; Additional reporting by Lewis Krauskopf in New York; Editing by Arun Koyyur and Jeffrey Benkoe\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-01-26T21:02:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-27T00:17:54.061+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
