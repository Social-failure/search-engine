Nineteen people were killed in what was Brazil's worst environmental disaster. \nVale thinks that Samarco can return to operating sooner speed up remediation works if it had a sole owner, the source said. Last month, Samarco won preliminary permits, but is not yet allowed to restart. \nThe deal depends on BHP's willingness to exit, the source added. Samarco is the only iron-ore operation owned by BHP outside Australia.
