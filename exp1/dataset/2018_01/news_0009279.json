SEC will borrow three EVs from Nissan while TEPCO and Takaoka Toko will provide three fast chargers. SEC did not give a timeframe for the plan.\nSuch a move is part of the company’s strategy to reduce reliance on oil and cut emissions, SEC said in a statement. State oil giant Saudi Aramco is also working on technologies to make vehicles more efficient.\nIts CEO Amin Nasser told Reuters in November improved efficiency would better sustain production in the long term with renewables hopefully growing and contributing to meeting rising demand which will require different sources of energy.\nNasser told CNBC in October in an interview, EVs will take a good market share but it will be decades before they have a significant percentage of the energy mix.\nSaudi Arabia hosted on Sunday a Saudi-Japanese business forum where MoUs have been signed with companies including Saline Water Conversion Corporation (SWCC) and New Energy and Industrial Technology Development (NEDCO).\nReporting by Reem Shamseddine, additional reporting by Marwa Rashad, editing by David Evans\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-01-15T02:14:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-14T20:23:04.020+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
