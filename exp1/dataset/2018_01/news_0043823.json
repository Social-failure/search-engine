The NBH informed commercial banks about the changes at a meeting earlier on Wednesday, the sources said.\nThe first of the NBHâ€™s bi-weekly 5-year and 10-year IRS auctions, held last Thursday, led to a sharp rebound in IRS and government bond yields in the market because the offered amounts and yield spreads disappointed some investors.\nThe central bank was not immediately reachable for comment.
