Last year, I obviously got a little derailed before Augusta,” he said, referring to the U.S. Masters, which he missed after falling down stairs and bruising his back on tournament eve. \nJohnson did not get back into full stride until after the four majors were completed but he won a tour playoff event in late August and seems to have put the injury behind him. \n“The swing’s finally getting back to where it was and I‘m starting to hit the ball with the right shape, and hitting a lot more consistent shots,” he said. \nThis week’s field includes seven of the top eight in the world rankings -- Johnson, Spieth, Thomas, Jon Rahm, Hideki Matsuyama, Rickie Fowler and Brooks Koepka. \nFowler enters as a recent winner after his runaway triumph at the Hero World Challenge in the Bahamas last month, a performance he hopes will be a springboard for more victories, rather than the near-misses he has become renowned for. \nHe also won the Honda Classic last year, while adding three runner-up finishes and a couple of thirds. \n“I would like to and should have won more last year,” he acknowledged, adding that it was time to just get the job done.
