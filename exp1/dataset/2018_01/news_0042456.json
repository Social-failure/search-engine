Changes to how compensation pay-outs are calculated, Insurance Premium Tax, more whiplash-style claims and rising repair bills are all piling on the pressure for cash-strapped drivers,” said Rob Cummings, Assistant Director and Head of Motor and Liability at the ABI. \nMotor insurance providers in Britain include Admiral ( ADML.L ), Direct Line ( DLGD.L ), esure ( ESUR.L ) and Hastings ( HSTG.L ).
