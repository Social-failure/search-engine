(NasdaqCM: LBCC) (the “Company”) today announced that it is not proceeding with its previously announced public offering of common stock at this time. The Company is continuing with its plan to consummate the purchase of 1,000 Antminer S9 mining rigs and 1,000 APW3++ PSUs, which it expects to be shipped in January 2018 for immediate commencement of mining operations.
