Fuel production in 2016 was 1.119 million bpd\nThe firm also expects to finish the start-up of its smallest refinery, Ciudad Madero in northeastern Tamaulipas state, by the end of March, Trevino added on the sidelines of an energy conference.\nMadero was expected to resume normal operations in December after a major maintenance that started in August.\nMexico’s largest refinery, the 330,000-bpd Salina Cruz, started resuming operational units in November after being halted for about two months due to damage caused by a quake.
