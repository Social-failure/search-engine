That compared with the consensus forecast for a 0.2 percent rise in a Reuters poll of economists. \nOn an annual basis, house prices rose 2.7 percent in the three months to December compared with the same period in 2016, slowing from a 3.9 percent rise in November. The Reuters poll of economists had pointed to a 3.3 percent rise.
