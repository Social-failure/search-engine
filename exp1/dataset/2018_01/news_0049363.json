It’s just fighting and grinding. I tried as hard as I possibly could. \n”Some of my go-to shots aren’t there and some of the shots I like to hit under certain circumstances aren’t there either.

Mandatory Credit: Orlando Ramirez-USA TODAY Sports \n“The only thing I have is my short game and my heart, and my heart got me through today.”Woods has improved his score each day, shooting 72, 71 and 70. \nWhile the leaders attracted a modest gallery, thousands tracked every step with Woods, including three men in red baseball caps displaying the words “Make Tiger Great Again” -- a play on words of U.S. President Donald Trump’s campaign slogan. \nThe fans were treated to a typically eventful round that included several brilliant recovery shots that required bold imagination and deft execution.

Four times on his outward half Woods holed putts from outside 10 feet, and though he did not hole any long putts coming home, he did not get himself in to as much trouble either. \n”I didn’t hit it worth a darn all day,“ he said. ”I was really struggling trying to find anything that was resemblance of a golf swing. \n“I was trying to miss the ball on the correct sides because I knew I didn’t have it. Then I had to rely on my touch, my feel, my putting, and that’s been good all week.” \nNoren sank a 40-footer to eagle the par-five sixth and added a tap-in birdie at the par-five 18th to card 69 and edge ahead on a crowded leaderboard. \nThe Swede heads Ryan Palmer (73) by a stroke and is two in front of J.B. Holmes and Michael Kim. \nSpanish defending champion Jon Rahm double-bogeyed the last to fall four behind.
