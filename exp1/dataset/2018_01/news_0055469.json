Hudson’s Bay shares were trading at C$10.50 on Wednesday, down 22 percent from a September peak, compared with the S&P 500 retailing index’s 34 percent gain. \n“The fourth quarter financing the Company announced leaves HBC flush with cash” (to go private), Litt said in the letter. \nA Hudson’s Bay spokesperson didn’t immediately respond to an emailed request for comment. Hudson’s Bay is also seeking buyers for its namesake flagship store in Vancouver and Litt said the sale is expected to bring in C$2.50 per share. A disposal of the company’s European real estate would fetch another C$5.20, he said. \nReuters reported in November that Austrian property and retail group Signa Holding had made a 3-billion euro ($3.74 billion) bid for HBC’s German department store operation Kaufhof. HBC acknowledged the approach and said it would review it.
