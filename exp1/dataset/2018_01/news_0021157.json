However, he did not say whether a conventional system would replace it. \nA full range of measures, which include revamps for the second and third divisions, regional leagues, and the lifting of a ban on visiting supporters at some games, will be announced in March, Tapia said. \n“It seems to me that these are the changes needed in football, along with more professional tournaments, where we can bring more value to the product we have,” he said in a statement posted on the Argentine Football Association’s website.
