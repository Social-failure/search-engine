Adele beat Beyonce in 2017, and in 2016 Lamar lost album of the year to Taylor Swift. \nLamar opened Sunday’s show at New York’s Madison Square Garden with a medley of his hits, accompanied by dancers in military fatigues and later dressed in red hoodies as they mimicked being shot. \nTIME‘S UP AND TRUMP \nOn the red carpet, dozens of musicians wore or held white roses to support women’s equality and freedom from sexual harassment, a theme echoed on stage in an emotional performance by pop singer Kesha of her single “Praying.” [L2N1PO03V] 60th Annual Grammy Awards – Photo Room – New York, U.S., 28/01/2018 – Bruno Mars poses with his Grammys for Record of the Year and Album of the Year for \"24K Magic\" and Song of the Year for \"That's What I Like\". REUTERS/Carlo Allegri \nActress and singer Janelle Monae said the music business had to address issues of equal pay for women, abuse of power and harassment. \n“We come in peace but we mean business. And to those who would dare try to silence us, we offer you two words: Time’s up,” Monae said in a reference to the Time’s Up movement spreading from Hollywood to the music business. \nOn a night when male artists dominated the winners list, R&B newcomer SZA, the most-nominated woman with five nods, left empty-handed. \nPolitics surfaced throughout the show.
