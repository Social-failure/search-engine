Scana’s shares were trading well below the offer price at $47.79, suggesting some investors were skeptical of the deal.\nScana, which owns the South Carolina Electric & Gas Co (SCE&G), has been under pressure ever since it scrapped the V.C. Summer nuclear project in July after spending about $9 billion on it with Santee Cooper.\nScana was funding some of the project’s costs from SCE&G, a move that angered customers and led to the utility rolling back electricity rates for residential users.\nThe nuclear project became a lightning rod for criticism, with local politicians arguing over who should pay for the aborted project.\nDominion Virginia Power's North Anna Power Station in Mineral, Virginia. Courtesy Dominion Power/via REUTERS South Carolina Governor Henry McMaster said while the deal is a step in the right direction, it will not resolve all problems for customers.\n“The only way to resolve this travesty is to sell Santee Cooper,” McMaster said, noting that the state-owned utility had racked up debt of $4 billion as it partnered Scana on the project.\nAs part of the deal, Dominion will also write off more than $1.7 billion in connection with the abandoned nuclear plant.\nGuggenheim Securities analyst Shahriar Pourreza said he expects regulators to approve the deal.\n“Scana does not have any other option and regulators will be aware of that, so the deal is likely to go through but it will be noisy,” Pourreza said.\nVirginia-based Dominion is offering 0.6690 of its shares for each Scana share, or about $55.35, based on Dominion’s average stock price of the last 30 trading days ended Jan. 2.\nThe deal is expected to immediately add to earnings after its closure in the third quarter, Dominion said.\nCredit Suisse was the financial adviser for Dominion. Morgan Stanley and RBC Capital Markets advised Scana.\nReporting by Yashaswini Swamynathan in Bengaluru; Writing by Nivedita Bhattacharjee; Editing by Sriraj Kalluvila and Saumyadeb Chakrabarty\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-03T14:13:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-03T14:28:59.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
