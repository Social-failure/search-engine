(NASDAQ: PPBI) (the “Company”), the holding company of Pacific Premier Bank (the “Bank”), reported net income for the fourth quarter of 2017 of $16.2 million, or $0.36 per diluted share, compared with net income of $20.2 million, or $0.50 per diluted share, for the third quarter of 2017 and net income of $12.0 million, or $0.43 per diluted share, for the fourth quarter of 2016. Net income for the fourth quarter of 2017 includes a $5.6 million reduction in the net deferred tax asset, as a result of H.R.1, formerly known as the \"Tax Cuts and Jobs Act\", which was signed into law on December 22, 2017. Net income for the fourth quarter also includes $5.4 million of merger-related expense associated with the acquisition of Plaza Bancorp (\"Plaza\"), which closed on November 1, 2017.\nFor the three months ended December 31, 2017, the Company’s return on average assets was 0.87% and return on average tangible common equity was 10.48%. For the three months ended September 30, 2017, the return on average assets was 1.26% and the return on average tangible common equity was 15.02%. For the three months ended December 31, 2016, the return on average assets was 1.24% and the return on average tangible common equity was 14.17%.\nSteven R. Gardner, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer of the Company, commented on the results, “We completed a very successful year in 2017, doubling the size of the Company, delivering a record level of earnings, and expanding our footprint across the Central Coast and Southern California. Our performance in 2017 reflects our ability to execute on what we believe are highly accretive acquisitions while also generating significant organic balance sheet growth.\n“We continued to see positive trends throughout the Company, aided by the closing of our acquisition of Plaza Bancorp and the addition of their experienced team of commercial bankers. Excluding the merger-related expense and the deferred tax asset revaluation, our operating results reflect the benefit of improved economies of scale as we realized earnings per share of $0.56 and a return on average assets and return on average tangible common equity of 1.35% and 15.9%, respectively. In addition, during the fourth quarter of 2017, we generated $648 million in loan originations and had well balanced production with seven different lending areas contributing more than $50 million in new loan production.\n“We believe 2018 will be another positive year for the Company, supported by the healthy economic conditions in our markets. As we approach the $10 billion asset threshold, we will continue to invest in the resources and personnel necessary to strengthen our infrastructure. With the operational integration of Plaza Bancorp largely completed, we will continue to look at other acquisition opportunities that can help us surpass the $10 billion threshold in a meaningful way, increase our scale and efficiencies, and further enhance the value of our franchise,” said Mr. Gardner.\nFINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS\nThree Months Ended December 31, September 30, December 31, 2017 2017 2016 Financial Highlights (dollars in thousands, except per share data) Net income $ 16,171 $ 20,232 $ 11,953 Diluted earnings per share $ 0.36 $ 0.50 $ 0.43 Return on average assets 0.87 % 1.26 % 1.24 % Return on average tangible common equity (1) 10.48 % 15.02 % 14.17 % Net interest margin 4.56 % 4.34 % 4.59 % Cost of deposits 0.32 % 0.28 % 0.27 % Efficiency ratio (2) 48.2 % 52.1 % 50.9 % Total assets $ 8,024,501 $ 6,532,334 $ 4,036,311 Tangible book value per share (1) $ 15.26 $ 14.35 $ 12.51 (1) A reconciliation of the non-GAAP measures of average tangible common equity and tangible book value per share to the GAAP measures of common stockholders' equity and book value are set forth at the end of this press release.

INCOME STATEMENT HIGHLIGHTS\nNet Interest Income and Net Interest Margin\nNet interest income totaled $78.2 million in the fourth quarter of 2017, an increase of $13.9 million, or 22%, from the third quarter of 2017. The increase in net interest income reflected higher average interest-earning assets of $927 million, primarily related to the acquisition of Plaza, which at acquisition added $1.1 billion of loans before purchase accounting adjustments, and organic loan growth from new loan originations and commitments of $648 million.\nNet interest margin for the fourth quarter of 2017 was 4.56% compared with 4.34% from the third quarter of 2017. The increase was partially driven by higher loan accretion of $4.7 million, compared to $2.9 million of accretion income in the prior quarter. Excluding the impact of accretion, our core net interest margin, expanded 12 basis points to 4.26%, compared with 4.14% from the prior quarter as portfolio loan yields expanded by 18 basis points overall, primarily as a result of the acquisition of Plaza and, to a lesser extent, higher prepayment fees. Loan prepayments and deferred fees/costs contributed 6 basis points to the current quarter net interest margin compared to 2 basis point in the prior quarter. Partially offsetting these favorable increases was a 4 basis point increase in deposit costs to 32 basis points from 28 basis points, largely due to the addition of Plaza deposits, which had an average cost of 0.61%.\nNet interest income for the fourth quarter of 2017 increased $35.9 million or 85% compared to the fourth quarter of 2016. The increase was primarily related to an increase in interest-earning assets of $3.1 billion, which resulted primarily from our organic loan growth since the end of the fourth quarter of 2016 and our acquisition of Plaza in the fourth quarter of 2017 and the acquisition of Heritage Oaks Bancorp (\"Heritage Oaks\") during the second quarter of 2017.\nCONSOLIDATED AVERAGE BALANCES AND YIELD DATA\nThree Months Ended Three Months Ended Three Months Ended December 31, 2017 September 30, 2017 December 31, 2016 Average\nBalance\nInterest Average\nYield/\nCost Average\nBalance\nInterest Average\nYield/\nCost Average\nBalance\nInterest Average\nYield/\nCost\nAssets (dollars in thousands) Cash and cash equivalents $ 172,644 $ 333 0.77 % $ 167,745 $ 265 0.63 % $ 106,811 $ 103 0.38 % Investment securities 824,634 5,229 2.54 765,537 4,981 2.60 381,081 2,688 2.82 Loans receivable, net (1) 5,800,849 80,122 5.48 4,937,979 64,915 5.22 3,178,779 43,006 5.38 Total interest-earning assets $ 6,798,127 $ 85,684 5.00 % 5,871,261 70,161 4.74 % 3,666,671 45,797 4.97 % Liabilities Interest-bearing deposits $ 3,591,132 $ 4,597 0.51 % $ 3,147,320 $ 3,557 0.45 % $ 1,979,240 $ 2,176 0.44 % Borrowings 492,850 2,917 2.35 399,206 2,313 2.30 190,761 1,317 2.75 Total interest-bearing liabilities $ 4,083,982 $ 7,514 0.73 % $ 3,546,526 $ 5,870 0.66 % $ 2,170,001 $ 3,493 0.64 % Noninterest-bearing deposits $ 2,152,455 $ 1,860,177 $ 1,200,536 Net interest income $ 78,170 $ 64,291 $ 42,304 Net interest margin (2) 4.56 % 4.34 % 4.59 % (1) Average balance includes nonperforming loans and is net of deferred loan origination fees and unamortized discounts and premiums.

Provision for Loan Losses\nA provision for loan losses was recorded for the fourth quarter of 2017 in the amount of $2.2 million, compared with a provision for loan losses of $2.0 million in the prior quarter. Our provision for loan losses was primarily due to organic loan growth, and to a lesser extent, $392,000 of net charge-offs.\nNoninterest income\nNoninterest income for the fourth quarter of 2017 was $9.5 million, an increase of $1.2 million, or 15%, from the third quarter of 2017. The increase from the third quarter of 2017 was primarily due to a $2.4 million increase in other income, principally due to a $1.8 million increase in recoveries from pre-acquisition charged-off loans, partially offset by a $1.1 million decrease in net gain from the sale of investment securities when compared to the prior quarter.\nDuring the quarter, the Bank sold $36 million of Small Business Administration (\"SBA\") loans for a gain of $2.8 million, compared with $31.9 million of SBA loans sold and a gain of $3.1 million in the prior quarter. Additionally, the Bank sold other loans during the quarter totaling $48.4 million for a net gain of $577,000.\nNoninterest income for the fourth quarter of 2017 increased by $5.1 million, or 119%, compared to the fourth quarter of 2016. The increase was primarily related to a $3.7 million increase in other income, principally due to a $2.0 million increase in recoveries from pre-acquisition charged-off loans when compared to prior quarter, a $944,000 increase in gain on the sale of loans and a $858,000 increase in deposit fees. The Bank sold securities for a net loss of $252,000 in the fourth quarter of 2017, partially offsetting the increase.\nThree Months Ended December 31, September 30, December 31,\n2017 2017 2016 NONINTEREST INCOME (dollars in thousands) Loan servicing fees $ 146 $ 276 $ 263 Deposit fees 1,288 1,117 430 Net gain from sales of loans 3,331 3,439 2,387 Net (loss) gain from sales of investment securities (252 ) 896 — Other income 4,938 2,493 1,238 Total noninterest income $ 9,451 $ 8,221 $ 4,318 Noninterest Expense\nNoninterest expense totaled $49.9 million for the fourth quarter of 2017, an increase of $10.3 million, or 26%, compared with the third quarter of 2017. The increase was primarily driven by merger-related expense of $5.4 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 compared with $503,000 in the third quarter of 2017. Excluding merger-related expense, noninterest expense increased $5.4 million to $44.5 million, primarily attributed to the acquisition of Plaza as compensation and benefits, premises and occupancy, data processing and CDI amortization increased $4.2 million, $524,000, $416,000 and $350,000, respectively.\nNoninterest expense grew by $24.5 million, or 97%, in comparison to the fourth quarter of 2016. The increase in expense was primarily related to the additional costs from the operations, personnel and branches retained from the acquisitions of Plaza and Heritage Oaks, combined with our continued investment in personnel to support our organic growth in loans and deposits.\nThree Months Ended December 31, September 30, December 31, 2017 2017 2016 NONINTEREST EXPENSE (dollars in thousands) Compensation and benefits $ 25,920 $ 21,707 $ 13,818 Premises and occupancy 4,540 4,016 2,531 Data processing 2,498 2,082 1,240 Other real estate owned operations, net 13 3 369 FDIC insurance premiums 499 379 320 Legal, audit and professional expense 1,924 1,978 892 Marketing expense 1,364 1,248 865 Office, telecommunications and postage expense 927 835 441 Loan expense 746 1,017 714 Deposit expense 1,478 1,655 1,388 Merger related expense 5,436 503 772 CDI amortization 2,111 1,761 525 Other expense 2,439 2,428 1,502 Total noninterest expense $ 49,895 $ 39,612 $ 25,377 Income Tax\nOn December 22, 2017, “H.R.1”, formerly known as the “Tax Cuts and Jobs Act”, was signed into law. Among other items, H.R.1 reduces the federal corporate tax rate to 21% from the existing maximum rate of 35%, effective January 1, 2018. As a result, the Company concluded that this required the Company’s net deferred tax asset to be revalued at the new lower tax rate. The Company has performed an analysis and determined that the value of the net deferred tax asset will be reduced by $5.6 million, which has been included in the fourth quarter 2017 income tax provision.\nFor the fourth quarter of 2017, our effective tax rate was 38.6%, excluding the net deferred tax asset adjustment, compared with 34.4% and 37.7% for the third quarter of 2017 and fourth quarter of 2016, respectively. The increase in the effective tax rate from the third quarter of 2017 was the result of a $1.1 million favorable tax true-up related to the filing of our 2016 return.\nBALANCE SHEET HIGHLIGHTS\nLoans\nLoans held for investment totaled $6.2 billion at December 31, 2017, an increase of $1.2 billion, or 24%, from September 30, 2017, and an increase of $3.0 billion, or 91%, from December 31, 2016. The increases were impacted by the acquisitions of Plaza and Heritage Oaks, as well as organic loan growth. The acquisition of Plaza added $1.1 billion of loans in the fourth quarter of 2017, and the acquisition of Heritage Oaks added $1.4 billion of loans in the second quarter of 2017, both before fair value adjustments. The total end of period weighted average interest rate on loans, excluding fees and discounts, at December 31, 2017 was 4.94%, compared to 4.81% at September 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016.\nLoan activity during the fourth quarter of 2017 included organic loan originations and commitments of $648 million, an increase of $90.0 million or 16% compared to prior quarter and $263 million or 68% compared to the fourth quarter of 2016. The $648 million of new organic loan originations and commitments during the fourth quarter of 2017 included $139 million of commercial and industrial loans, $106 million of construction loans, $79.4 million of commercial real estate non-owner occupied loans, $65.5 million of franchise loans, $65.0 million of multifamily, $61.3 million of commercial real estate owner occupied loans, $58.3 million of SBA loans, $36.0 million of agribusiness loans and $24.6 million of consumer loans.\nAt December 31, 2017 our loans held for investment to deposit ratio was 101.8%, compared with 99.8% and 103.1% at September 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016, respectively.\nDecember 31, September 30, December 31, 2017 2017 2016 (dollars in thousands) Business Loans: Commercial and industrial $ 1,086,659 $ 763,091 $ 563,169 Franchise 660,414 626,508 459,421 Commercial owner occupied 1,289,213 805,137 454,918 SBA 185,514 107,211 88,994 Agribusiness 116,066 86,466 — Total business loans 3,337,866 2,388,413 1,566,502 Real Estate Loans: Commercial non-owner occupied 1,243,115 1,098,995 586,975 Multi-family 794,384 797,370 690,955 One-to-four family 270,894 246,248 100,451 Construction 282,811 301,334 269,159 Farmland 145,393 140,581 — Land 31,233 30,719 19,829 Total real estate loans 2,767,830 2,615,247 1,667,369 Consumer Loans: Consumer loans 92,931 6,228 4,112 Gross loans held for investment 6,198,627 5,009,888 3,237,983 Plus: Deferred loan origination costs/(fees) and premiums/(discounts), net (2,159 ) (571 ) 3,630 Loans held for investment 6,196,468 5,009,317 3,241,613 Allowance for loan losses (28,936 ) (27,143 ) (21,296 ) Loans held for investment, net $ 6,167,532 $ 4,982,174 $ 3,220,317 Loans held for sale, at lower of cost or fair value $ 23,426 $ 44,343 $ 7,711 Asset Quality and Allowance for Loan Losses\nAt December 31, 2017, the allowance for loan losses was $28.9 million, compared to $27.1 million and $21.3 million at September 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016, respectively, with the increases driven principally by our organic loan growth.

AND SUBSIDIARIES\nGAAP RECONCILIATIONS\n(dollars in thousands, except per share data)\nFor periods presented below, return on average tangible common equity and adjusted return on average tangible common equity are non-GAAP financial measures derived from GAAP-based amounts. We calculate these figures by excluding CDI amortization expense and exclude the average CDI and average goodwill from the average stockholders' equity during the period. Management believes that the exclusion of such items from these financial measures provides useful information to gain an understanding of the operating results of our core business. However, these non-GAAP financial measures are supplemental and are not a substitute for an analysis based on GAAP measures. As other companies may use different calculations for these adjusted measures, this presentation may not be comparable to other similarly titled adjusted measures reported by other companies.\nThree Months Ended December 31, September 30, December 31, 2017 2017 2016 Net income $ 16,171 $ 20,232 $ 11,953 Plus CDI amortization expense 2,111 1,761 525 Less CDI amortization expense tax adjustment 815 606 198 Net income for average tangible common equity $ 17,467 $ 21,387 $ 12,280 Average stockholders' equity $ 1,161,174 $ 976,081 $ 458,603 Less average CDI 40,274 34,699 9,788 Less average goodwill 454,362 371,651 102,068 Average tangible common equity $ 666,538 $ 569,731 $ 346,747 Return on average equity 5.57 % 8.29 % 10.43 % Return on average tangible common equity 10.48 % 15.02 % 14.17 % Tangible common equity to tangible assets (the \"tangible common equity ratio\") and tangible book value per share are non-GAAP financial measures derived from GAAP-based amounts. We calculate the tangible common equity ratio by excluding the balance of intangible assets from common stockholders' equity and dividing by tangible assets. We calculate tangible book value per share by dividing tangible common equity by common shares outstanding, as compared to book value per share, which we calculate by dividing common stockholders' equity by shares outstanding. We believe that this information is consistent with the treatment by bank regulatory agencies, which exclude intangible assets from the calculation of risk-based capital ratios. Accordingly, we believe that these non-GAAP financial measures provide information that is important to investors and that is useful in understanding our capital position and ratios. However, these non-GAAP financial measures are supplemental and are not a substitute for an analysis based on GAAP measures. As other companies may use different calculations for these measures, this presentation may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures reported by other companies.\nDecember 31, September 30, June 30, March 31, December 31, 2017 2017 2017 2017 2016 Total stockholders' equity $ 1,241,996 $ 981,660 $ 959,731 $ 471,025 $ 459,740 Less intangible assets 536,343 405,222 405,869 111,432 111,941 Tangible common equity $ 705,653 $ 576,438 $ 553,862 $ 359,593 $ 347,799 Book value per share $ 26.86 $ 24.44 $ 23.96 $ 16.88 $ 16.54 Less intangible book value per share 11.60 10.09 10.13 4.00 4.03 Tangible book value per share $ 15.26 $ 14.35 $ 13.83 $ 12.88 $ 12.51 Total assets $ 8,024,501 $ 6,532,334 $ 6,440,631 $ 4,174,428 $ 4,036,311 Less intangible assets 536,343 405,222 405,869 111,432 111,941 Tangible assets $ 7,488,158 $ 6,127,112 $ 6,034,762 $ 4,062,996 $ 3,924,370 Tangible common equity ratio 9.42 % 9.41 % 9.18 % 8.85 % 8.86 %\nView source version on businesswire.com : http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180130005566/en/\nPacific Premier Bancorp, Inc.\nSteven R.
