The company announced Wednesday the treatment would cost $850,000. \nUnder the terms of the deal, Sangamo will receive a $12 million upfront payment from Pfizer and an additional $150 million in milestone payments, the companies said. \nALS (amyotrophic lateral sclerosis), whose sufferers include renowned British physicist Stephen Hawking, attracted international attention in 2014 with the « Ice Bucket Challenge », in which people posted videos of pouring ice-cold water on themselves to encourage donations to research. \nShares of Sangamo were up 4.3 percent at $18.30, while those of Pfizer were unchanged.
