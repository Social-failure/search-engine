The garden was planned on one of the higher patches of land near downtown Washington, less than 5 miles from both the Capitol and the White House. \nMs. Murdoch in 1999 married Rupert Murdoch, who is the executive chairman of News Corp NWSA, -1.05% , which publishes The Wall Street Journal and MarketWatch. Mr. Murdoch successfully filed for divorce in 2013. Ms. Murdoch still uses her married name.
