The patients were broken up into two groups, one that participated in yoga, balance and strength training, and another that focused on aerobic exercise. \nAfter two years the aerobic group saw an 18% improvement in their maximum oxygen intake during exercise and a 25% improvement in the “plasticity” in the left ventricular muscle of the heart. Both are signs of a healthier heart, reports BBC News . \nThe big takeaway is that researchers think exercise should be a part of everyone’s routine, the lead researcher in the group calling its importance akin to teeth brushing. And even if you’ve led a sedentary life up to this point, there’s still an opportunity to help correct it.
