Another is the use of Huawei handsets by AT&T&rsquo;s discount subsidiary Cricket, the aides said.\nChinese foreign ministry spokesman Lu Kang said on Tuesday he did not know anything about the details of the commercial cooperation cases, but added China hopes other countries would provide a fair operating environment for Chinese firms.\n“We hope that China and the United States can work hard together to maintain the healthy and stable development of trade and business ties. This accords with the joint interests of both,” Lu told a daily news briefing in Beijing.\nChina Mobile, the world’s biggest mobile phone operator, did not respond to requests for comment.\nFILE PHOTO - A man walks past a logo during the presentation the Huawei's new smartphone, the Ascend P7, launched by China's Huawei Technologies in Paris, May 7, 2014. REUTERS/Philippe Wojazer/File Photo AT&T declined to comment but said that it had made no decisions on 5G suppliers.\nU.S. lawmakers who have in the past expressed concerns about the prospect of the deal between AT&T and Huawei either declined to comment or were not immediately available.\nHuawei declined to comment, but earlier this week told Reuters that it sells its equipment through more than 45 of the world’s top 50 carriers and puts the privacy and security of its customers as its top priority.\nNational security experts fear that any data from a Huawei device, for example about the location of the phone’s user, would be available to Chinese government intelligence services.\nIn 2012, Huawei and ZTE Corp were the subject of a U.S. investigation into whether their equipment provided an opportunity for foreign espionage and threatened critical U.S. infrastructure - a link that Huawei has consistently denied.\n“The next wave of wireless communication has enormous economic and national security implications. China’s participation in setting the standards and selling the equipment raises many national security issues that demand strict and prompt attention,” said Michael Wessel, a member of the U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission, which was set up by Congress.\nU.S. lawmakers do not want China Mobile to be given a license to do business in the United States, the congressional aides said. China Mobile applied for the license in 2011, and the application is pending before the Federal Communications Commission.\nHuawei and Chinese telecom firms have long struggled to gain a toehold in the U.S. market, partly because of U.S. government pressure on potential U.S. partners.\nTwo Republican lawmakers, Representatives Michael Conaway and Liz Cheney, introduced a bill this week that bars the U.S. government from using or contracting with Huawei or ZTE Corp, a Chinese telecommunications and equipment and systems company.\nReporting by Diane Bartz; Additional reporting by Ben Blanchard in BEIJING and Anjali Athavaley; Editing by Chris Sanders, Lisa Shumaker and Himani Sarkar\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-16T08:13:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-16T08:28:16.003+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
