These grew by 1 percentage point to 63% in 2017. \n“We did that to get another cloud revenue stream in the mix,” McDermott said. \nSAP reiterated a forecast for 2020 of non-IFRS operating profit of 8.5 to 9.0 billion euros ($10.5-11.1 billion) on revenue of 28 to 29 billion euros. As Good as It Gets \nThe world economy is “about as good as it gets,” the 56-year-old American said, pushing back against fears that rising trade protectionism could hurt globally diversified businesses like SAP. \nMcDermott has just completed a week of hectic corporate diplomacy in which he met French President Emmanuel Macron in Paris and dined with U.S. leader Donald Trump at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. \nHe described a combination of pro-growth, fair trade and low tax policies as beneficial to business in a world economy that was performing strongly across all regions. \n“President Macron is aligned, to a certain extent, with President Trump on a lower tax rate,” he said of his recent meetings with the leaders. \nAll of SAP‘s regional businesses are growing at double digits, McDermott said, highlighting “hyper growth” in China. \nRead: 3 Big Takeaways from Amazon’s Cloud Bonanza \nSAP said it expected total non-IFRS revenue of 24.6 to 25.1 billion euros ($30 bln-$31 bln) for 2018, in line with the forecasts of analysts polled by Thomson Reuters. \nBut the outlook also highlighted that the company expects margins to increase faster in 2018. Revenue is set to grow by around 5 to 7%, excluding currency translation effects, it said, while operating profit is poised to increase by 8 to 11%. \nIt forecast 2018 non-IFRS operating profit of 7.3 to 7.5 billion euros, adding that the implementation of IFRS 15, a new accounting rule on revenue recognition, would add 200 million euros to profits. \nSAP shares were little changed — falling a fraction of 1% to trade at 91.72 euros in Frankfurt at 10:22 a.m. GMT.
