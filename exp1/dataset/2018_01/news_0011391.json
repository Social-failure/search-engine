It will change its name and now focus exclusively on cyber security M&A, an area it sees underserved by large investment banks. Tedesco worked at Citigroup and Jefferies while McAlpine worked at Blackstone Advisory earlier in their careers.\n“We’ve seen $20 billion of venture capital go into the space over the past few years and there are 3,000 vendors. Many are going to merge, or get some investment or recapitalizations. This means the M&A will happen,” DeWalt said in an interview. DeWalt sits on the board of ForeScout Technologies and Delta Airlines Inc.\nMcAlpine said DeWalt’s connections in Washington and with cyber security companies hatched in Israel will be key to helping the firm succeed.\nWhile Momentum said it is an M&A broker as defined by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, its co-founder McAlpine said it is purposely shying away from the “investment bank” moniker because it provides full advisory services from a company’s founding to its exit.\nLast year, Momentum advised on M&A transactions such as ADT’s acquisition of Datashield, Weblife on its sale to Proofpoint Inc, and Cyphort on its sale to Juniper Networks Inc.\nThe firm estimates there were about 166 global cyber security deals last year where private companies were acquired, totalling $7.8 billion.\nInvestors are not seeing multibillion-dollar windfalls, however. The median for deal sizes in cyber security was only $68 million last year, up from $42 million in 2016, Momentum said.\nHundreds of security startups have sprouted in recent years, promising “next-generation” technologies to fight cyber criminals, government spies and hacker activists, who have plagued some of the world’s biggest corporations.\nMany of the younger companies have struggled to stand out from the crowd and increase revenue on a sustainable basis since sophisticated cyber attacks can make software obsolete very quickly. This makes the market ripe for consolidation, according to DeWalt.\nReporting by Liana B.
