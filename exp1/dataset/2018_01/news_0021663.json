Those reports carry very serious accusations towards me,” said Tsang. \n“They have affected my reputation, and sadly, they have hurt my supporting friends, my beloved family, my children ... I feel that there is a need for me to now step up and to make a public response.” \nTsang, an actor, comedian, director and producer, described the rape allegation as “totally made-up”.

Currently, legal proceedings are under way,” said Tsang, who took no questions from reporters. \nHan had written on her verified Weibo account in January, after the rape reports began circulating, that Tsang had made “sexual assaults on female celebrities more than once”. On another occasion, she said Tsang had tried to spike the drinks of some of her models in a karaoke lounge in Hong Kong. \nHan gave no immediate response to a Reuters request for comment. \nThe campaign aimed at raising awareness of sexual harassment and assault, epitomised by the #MeToo social media hashtag, was last month named Time magazine’s 2017 “Person of the Year”. \nIt has sparked numerous accusations by men and women who said they were victimized by high-powered figures in the entertainment industry and other fields.
