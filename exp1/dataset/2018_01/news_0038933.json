The broader market rose 0.7 percent. \nThe company said the catastrophes would impact its combined operating ratio, or COR - an industry term denoting the percentage of claims payouts against premium income -- to be about 104 percent, up from its previous target range of 100-102 percent. \nThe higher the figure, the greater the payouts versus premium income -- and the bigger the burden on the insurer. \nQBE said its COR target range in fiscal 2018 was between 95.0 percent to 97.5 percent. \nThe company’s intentions to shrink contrasts with the growth plans of global rivals. Zurich Insurance last month acquired Australia and New Zealand Banking Group ’s life insurance arm, and Hong Kong-listed AIA Group bought Commonwealth Bank of Australia’s insurance unit in September. \nQBE will release its full-year results on Feb. 26, when it will also reveal whether the losses will affect a planned buy back and dividend payments, Regan said.
