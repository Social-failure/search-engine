They were originally charged with aggravated sexual assault and manufacturing and dissemination of child pornography. \nPolice said at the time of the attack in March that five or six males had assaulted the girl, whose family contacted authorities when she went missing. People who were watching the attack live did not call police, they said. \nReuters does not name the victims of sexual assault.
