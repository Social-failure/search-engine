Government debt continued to decrease towards the threshold with budget surpluses forecast over the forecast horizon,” the Commission said.\nGerman budget plans envisage a rise in investment from 33.2 billion euros in 2016 to 37.1 billion in 2019.\nDespite the lowest unemployment rate in the euro zone at 3.6 percent of the workforce, Germany has slow wage growth, which also makes it more difficult for the European Central Bank to bring inflation higher, closer to its target of below, but close to two percent in the euro zone.
