Turgal recently retired from the FBI after 21 years of service.\nAt Deloitte, Turgal will primarily focus on advising clients on cyber incident response, cyber war-gaming and cyber resilience. As a former member of the FBI's C-suite, he is the highest ranking and the second former-FBI leader to join Deloitte's Cyber Risk Services practice in a managing director role in the past year.\n\"James' strategic, forward-thinking approach to incident response will be invaluable as we continue to provide world-class, comprehensive cybersecurity services to our clients,\" said Chuck Saia, CEO, Deloitte Risk and Financial Advisory.\nAs executive assistant director for the FBI Information and Technology Branch (CIO), Turgal was responsible for all global applications, corporate systems, infrastructure and operations for the bureau's worldwide information and technology needs.
