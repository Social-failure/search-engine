The company’s shares were down 2.8 percent at $107.50 on Thursday afternoon after falling as much as 6.8 percent.\nIQOS is used by nearly 4 million people in 30 markets outside the United States but needs FDA authorization to be marketed in America.\nThe panel did conclude that the product exposes users to lower levels of harmful chemicals but said the company had not shown that lowering exposure to those chemicals is reasonably likely to translate into a measurable reduction in disease or death. Philip Morris needs to show both in order to claim the product modifies the risk of cigarettes.\nSome panelists were concerned that not all the harmful or potentially harmful chemicals in cigarettes were significantly reduced in the iQOS aerosol. Philip Morris presented data showing an overall exposure reduction of about 95 percent.\nFILE PHOTO: A man poses for a photograph while using a Philip Morris iQOS smoking device, in Bogota, Colombia November 14, 2017. REUTERS/Jaime Saldarriaga/File Photo The FDA is not bound to follow the recommendations of its advisory panels and may not agree with the group’s logic. The agency recently proposed a broad policy shift that would reduce nicotine in cigarettes to “non-addictive” levels while increasing development of lower-risk alternatives for those unable to quit.\nThe FDA is expected to decide whether Philip Morris can sell iQOS within the next few months. It will decide separately whether to authorize the modified-risk claims.\nSlideshow (11 Images) If cleared, iQOS would be sold in the United States by Philip Morris’ partner Altria Group Inc. Altria shares were down 2.1 percent at $70.04 in afternoon trading.\nLast month, a Reuters investigation described irregularities in the clinical trials that supported Philip Morris' iQOS application to the FDA.
