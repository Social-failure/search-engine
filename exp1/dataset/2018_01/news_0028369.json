Slideshow (2 Images) \nAn officer at the Copacabana police station confirmed the baby’s death by telephone and said 15 injured people were being treated in hospital. He did not know if the driver’s epilepsy fit had been confirmed. \nWitnesses said on the Globo News network that the racing car shot over a bicycle path and across the sidewalk, hitting people and crashing through tables and chairs, before coming to a stop on the sand of the beach. The smashed widescreen and dented roof indicated the force with which the vehicle had hit people. \nThe sidewalk of the Copacabana crescent-shaped beach is a favourite summer evening walk for Rio residents and tourists that have begun to arrive in Rio ahead of Carnival celebrations next month.
