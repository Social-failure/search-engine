REUTERS/Shannon Stapleton/File Photo \nPetrocelli said that the government had put 35 potential witnesses on a preliminary list while AT&T had 22. Neither man identified the witnesses or people being questioned in depositions. \nThe next status hearing was set for Jan. 19. \nJudge Richard Leon of the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia will oversee a trial that begins on March 19 and run about 15 days. The companies recently extended the termination date for the deal to June 21. \nThe fate of the deal has been widely followed because U.S. President Donald Trump criticized it on the campaign trail in 2016 and has repeatedly attacked the reporting of Time Warner’s CNN news network. \nTrump recently renewed his opposition to the deal. “I think your pricing’s going to go up. I don’t think it’s a good deal for the country,” he said in November.
