The gains came in multi-unit properties which soared almost 31 percent in November, leaving total approvals up a resounding 17 percent on a year before.\nThe value of all those homes approved also jumped to a record peak of A$7.7 billion ($6.05 billion), a windfall for economic growth.\nThe revival in approvals has come as a major surprise to analysts who had assumed the sector was on its last legs. The current building bonanza has already been under way for almost five years, far longer than past cycles.\nTypically, past booms were snuffed out by rising interest rates, but this time subdued inflation has allowed the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) to keep rates at record lows for the past 17 months.\nThe central bank still seems in no hurry to tighten with inflation below its target band of 2 to 3 percent and wages growth only just above all-time lows.\nPolicy makers have also managed to curb speculation in housing by tightening lending rules rather than jacking up rates, thus extending the lifetime of the building cycle.\nHome construction has major spill over effects in the economy given the many suppliers involved and the need for buyers to furnish new premises.\nOver 100,000 new construction jobs were created in the year to November, positions that tend to pay higher than the average.\nA separate survey from ANZ out on Tuesday showed job advertisements across Australia had fallen back by 2.3 percent in December, but that followed a run of strong months.\n“Our assessment of economic conditions suggests a continued improvement in labour market conditions over 2018,” said ANZ’s head of Australian economics, David Plank.\n“A slow but steady reduction in spare capacity should also eventually feed into wage growth, providing some support for consumers.”\n$1 = 1.2737 Australian dollars Reporting by Wayne Cole; Editing by Sam Holmes\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-09T04:06:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-09T10:15:41.550+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
