As Ronaldo walked towards the dressing room his main preoccupation was with how his face looked. \nHe asked one of Madrid’s medical staff if he could use his phone and was seen using the mobile’s screen to scrutinise his face, which was left as red as the shirt of his former club Manchester United.
