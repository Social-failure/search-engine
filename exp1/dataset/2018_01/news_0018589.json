Judges are not bound by the advocate general’s view, but tend to follow it. \n“Although member states are free to authorise marriage between persons of the same sex or not, they may not impede the freedom of residence of an EU citizen by refusing to grant his or her spouse of the same sex, a national of a non-EU country,” Wathelet said in his opinion. \nThe Romanian man who brought the case married an American man in 2010 in Belgium, where same-sex marriages are allowed, and then sought a residence permit for his spouse from the Romanian authorities. \nThey turned down the request because Romanian law prohibits same-sex marriages and does not recognise such marriages that have taken place abroad. \nThe couple said the decision was discriminatory and challenged it in Romanian courts. Romania’s Constitutional Court asked the European Court of Justice whether the non-EU spouse should be regarded as a spouse eligible to claim a right of residence.
