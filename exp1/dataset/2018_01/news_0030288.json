As president, he has become a frequent attender of Russian Orthodox ceremonies, and has given the church a major voice in society.\nThe Russian leader, who is 65, has a track record of stripping to the waist in public to reveal his torso.\nIn August last year he was photographed with his shirt off catching fish in a mountain lake in Siberia and in August 2009, a bare-chested Putin was pictured riding a horse during a Siberian holiday.\nReporting by Christian Lowe; Editing by Andrew Osborn\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-19T08:35:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-19T08:51:07.001+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
