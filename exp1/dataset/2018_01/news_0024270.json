But a later U.N. mission, known as MINUSCA, was also accused of widespread misconduct, including 12 cases of sexual exploitation and abuse.\nECPAT, an organization that campaigns against the sexual exploitation of children, told Reuters it did not rule out the possibility of appealing the magistratesâ€™ decision.\nReporting by Simon Carraud; Editing by Matthew Mpoke Bigg\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-01-16T00:14:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-15T22:19:29.005+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
