In total, Ripple used XRP sales to bring in over $180 million last year, without having to give up any equity in the company.\nThat gives Ripple a significant cash cushion as it tries to sell its software to financial institutions and provides some protection in case the price of XRP crashes.\nIt's been a wild ride so far to start 2018. After starting the year at $2.30, XRP quickly shot up to a high of $3.84 on Jan. 4, before tumbling below $1.12 days later. The currency currently sits at $1.35, which translates into about $81 billion worth of holdings for Ripple.\nIn order to control the flow of XRP into the market, Ripple put the majority of its stake — 55 billion — into an escrow account and has the flexibility to sell up to 1 billion a month. CEO Brad Garlinghouse told CNBC , in a story published last week, that the company has no intention of maximizing its sales to pad its cash position.\nIn the fourth quarter, Ripple sold $71.5 million of XRP through programmatic sales and $20.1 million directly to investors. If it sold the same percentage of total volume traded through programmatic sales this quarter as last, Ripple would have already generated over $70 million through Jan. 23, using daily volume numbers tracked by CoinMarketCap .\nThe big test for Ripple is getting financial institutions to adopt XRP so that it's more than just a highly volatile trade.\nEarlier this month, the company announced that MoneyGram is using Ripple's xRapid technology and XRP currency for cross-border payments. And in a separate announcement on Wednesday, the company said that IDT Corporation and Mercury FX will use xRapid \"to settle remittances and corporate transactions quickly.\"\nThe idea is to eliminate the time it takes for payments to clear using a digital currency that's built for financial transactions. Here's how Mercury FX founder Alastair Constance described it in the statement.\n\"Digital assets promise fast transaction speeds but XRP is far faster than all of them, including bitcoin. Cutting settlement times from hours and days to just three seconds or less will remove billions of dollars in unnecessary intermediary fees.\"\nWATCH: Ripple CEO explains why his digital currency can transform banking show chapters Ripple CEO explains why his digital currency can transform banking 2:03 PM ET Wed, 27 Dec 2017 | 02:42", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-24T21:06:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-24T21:27:40.005+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
