South Korea, Japan and China all made noises in recent weeks about a regulatory crackdown while France and Germany will make joint proposals to regulate bitcoin at the next summit of the G20 group of major economies in March.\nThe CFTC and Securities and Exchange Commission this month warned investors about risks posed by virtual currency operators and have both been increasing their jurisdiction over the cryptocurrency market, which has no overriding federal regulator.\nOn Thursday they issued a joint statement saying both agencies would ”continue to address violations and to bring actions to stop and prevent fraud in the offer and sale of digital instruments.”\nReporting by Michelle PriceEditing by Chizu Nomiyama\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-19T16:09:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-19T16:21:01.011+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
