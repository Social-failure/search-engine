I have a feeling of chagrin, to be honest. But the responsibility is all mine,” he said in the Dec. 28 statement. \nThe incident has thrown a spotlight on sumo’s struggle to reform harsh conditions that can breed violence in its closed, hierarchical world, although some wrestlers say there have been improvements in the decade since a trainee was beaten to death.
