It is an emerging area of intense interest for banks and other financial companies as well as technology developers, with potential uses in a range of financial transactions including securities settlement and payments. \nEmbracing the relatively new phenomenon of digital currencies and blockchain has become a sure-fire and controversial way for companies to remake their images â€” and boost their share prices. Shares of Long Blockchain Corp. doubled after the beverage company changed its name from Long Island Iced Tea Corp. in December. The biotech equipment maker Bioptix got a similar boost when it changed its name to Riot Blockchain last year. \nKodak, based in Rochester, New York and founded in 1888, is planning to hold an initial coin offering on Jan. 31 for accredited investors in the U.S., U.K., Canada and other countries. The new platform is a partnership with Wenn Digital. \nKodakOne not only allows photographers to license their work and get paid more quickly, it will search the internet for unauthorized use of images, the company said. Kodak CEO Jeff Clarke said in a statement: \"Kodak has always sought to democratize photography and make licensing fair to artists. These technologies give the photography community an innovative and easy way to do just that.\" WATCH: Executive says cryptocurrencies are a 'Kodak moment' for some show chapters ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-09T19:28:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-09T19:47:49.012+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
