Coffee shop workers will receive a grant of at least $500 and store managers will receive $2,000 grants.\nStarting July 1, all employees will accrue paid time off to care for themselves and loved ones when they are ill. Starbucks said the national benefit was designed to match or exceed the benefits some partners were already due under existing city or state-mandated paid sick leave laws.\nStarbucks also expanded its parental leave policy for cafe workers, giving non-birth parents up to six weeks of paid leave when welcoming a new child.\nReporting by Lisa Baertlein in Los Angeles; Editing by Himani Sarkar\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-24T13:08:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-24T13:23:02.011+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
