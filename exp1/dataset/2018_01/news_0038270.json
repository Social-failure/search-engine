His main rival, Norway’s Johannes Boe, finished a distant sixth. \nThe 29-year-old, who already has two Olympic gold medals and 11 world titles, snatched his 15th podium finish in as many World Cup races this season. \n“I raced smartly, and I even spared myself for the last lap but I didn’t even need that energy,” said Fourcade.
