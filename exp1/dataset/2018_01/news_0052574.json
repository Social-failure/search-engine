It was a hard decision because this time I wouldn’t be able to come back.”\nThe BBC article was published shortly after King Maha Vajiralongkorn ascended the throne in December 2016 following the death of his father, King Bhumibol Adulyadej, who died that October aged 88.\nThailand has the world’s toughest lese-majeste law, known as Article 112. The law sets a sentence of up to 15 years in prison for each offense of royal insult committed.\nJatupat Boonpattararaksa, an activist who has staged several anti-junta protests, was arrested in 2016 and was sentenced last year to two and a half years in prison for posting the same BBC article.\nProsecutions under both the Computer Crime Act and the royal defamation law have increased sharply since a military junta took power in a 2014 coup. Since the coup, at least 94 people have been prosecuted for lese majeste. As many as 43 people have been sentenced, the iLaw group that monitors royal insult cases said earlier this month.\nPrime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha, who heads the junta, has repeatedly vowed to stamp out critics of the monarchy and has also called for stronger prosecution of lese-majeste cases since the coup.\nCritics of the junta say the law has been used to silence its opponents while international rights groups and some Bangkok-based Western diplomats have decried Thailand’s harsh sentences for lese-majeste convictions.\nReporting by Patpicha Tanakasempipat; Editing by Amy Sawitta Lefevre\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-28T18:22:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-28T18:37:00.039+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
