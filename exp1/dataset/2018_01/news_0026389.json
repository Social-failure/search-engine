We cannot sacrifice the quality,” he said.\nSamsung’s rivals in Africa include China’s Huawei Technologies [HWT.UL] and Tecno, owned by Hong Kong’s Transsion Holdings.\nReporting by Duncan Miriri; Editing by Edmund Blair\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-01-15T21:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-15T15:08:47.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
