Their shares rose 3.6 percent, 1.9 percent and 1.8 percent respectively.\nAmong the gainers, Just Eat led with a rise of 4.7 percent, underpinned by a Barclays upgrade to “overweight” on expectations of strong revenue momentum in the fourth quarter and the year 2018.\nOil prices, surging to their highest since 2014, also helped BP and Royal Dutch Shell add a few points to the index with rises of 0.5 percent.
