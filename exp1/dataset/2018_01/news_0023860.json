Words such as \"guidance,\" \"expects,\" \"intends,\" \"projects,\" \"plans,\" \"believes,\" \"estimates,\" \"targets,\" \"anticipates,\" and similar expressions are used to identify these forward-looking statements. Our expectations about quarterly and full year results are based on preliminary unaudited information about the fourth quarter of 2017 and are subject to revision. Although the quarter is now completed, we are still in the early stages of our standard financial reporting closing procedures. Accordingly, as we complete our normal quarter-end and year-end closing and review processes, actual results could differ materially from these preliminary estimates.\nExamples of forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, statements regarding financial results for the fiscal fourth quarter and full year 2017, which are subject to adjustment in connection with the year-end audit and preparation of our annual report on form 10-K, expected sales, as well as any other statement that does not directly relate to any historical or current fact. Forward-looking statements are based on management’s current expectations and assumptions regarding Ichor’s business, the economy and other future conditions, which may not prove to be accurate. These statements are not guarantees and are subject to risks, uncertainties and changes in circumstances that are difficult to predict. Accordingly, you are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date they are made. Many factors could cause actual results to differ materially and adversely from these forward-looking statements, including: (1) dependence on expenditures by manufacturers and cyclical downturns in the semiconductor capital equipment industry, (2) reliance on a very small number of original equipment manufacturers for a significant portion of sales, (3) negotiating leverage held by our customers, (4) competitiveness and rapid evolution of the industries in which we participate, (5) risks associated with weakness in the global economy and geopolitical instability, (6) keeping pace with developments in the industries we serve and with technological innovation generally, (7) designing, developing and introducing new products that are accepted by original equipment manufacturers in order to retain our existing customers and obtain new customers, (8) managing our manufacturing and procurement process effectively, (9) defects in our products that could damage our reputation, decrease market acceptance and result in potentially costly litigation, (9) dependence on a limited number of suppliers and (10) the integration of recent acquisitions with Ichor, including the ability to retain customers, suppliers and key employees. Additional information concerning these and other factors can be found in Ichor's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”), including other risks, relevant factors and uncertainties identified in the \"Risk Factors\" section of Ichor's Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC on March 28, 2017 and Ichor’s Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q filed with the SEC on May 12, 2017 and August 11, 2017.\nAll forward-looking statements in this press release are based upon information available to us as of the date hereof, and qualified in their entirety by this cautionary statement.
