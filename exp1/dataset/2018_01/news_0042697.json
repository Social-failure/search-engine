( bit.ly/2DFwHi8 )\nDaher, which also supplies engine-maker Pratt & Whitney Canada, U.S. jet manufacturer Gulfstream Aerospace Corporation and Canada’s Bombardier ( BBDb.TO ), expects to start delivering thermoplastic parts to Boeing in September.\nKayat said the company had ample capacity to take on debt for its development.\nHe did not rule out either selling a stake -- France’s state-run investment bank Bpifrance already owns 12.5 percent -- or an eventual initial public offering (IPO), although he expressed wariness about going public.\n“But this (IPO) isn’t very smart in aeronautics because there’s an incompatibility between publishing quarterly results and 20-year strategy plans,” he said.\nKayat said Daher was also targeting more work in the software sector, mirroring moves by other leading engineering and aerospace groups, such as General Electric ( GE.N ) which last month raised its stake in Swedish 3D printer firm Arcam ( ARCM.ST ).\n($1 = 0.8098 euros)\nReporting by Cyril Altmeyer; Writing by Richard Lough; Editing by Sudip Kar-Gupta and Adrian Croft\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-24T18:28:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-24T18:38:24.018+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
