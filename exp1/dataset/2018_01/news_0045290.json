Nasrallah added that Hezbollah had a very clear religious and moral stance which forbids drugs and drug trading. \nU.S. Republicans have criticised former President Barack Obama after a report that his administration hindered the Drug Enforcement Administration programme targeting Hezbollah, during its negotiation of the 2015 Iran nuclear deal. \nThe United States classifies the Iran-backed Shi‘ite Hezbollah as a terrorist organisation.
