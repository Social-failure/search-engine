The parents, David Allen Turpin, 57, and Louise Anna Turpin, 49, were arrested and each charged with nine counts of torture and 10 counts of child endangerment. They were ordered held on $9 million bail each.\nNeighbors said the Turpins and their children rarely emerged from their unkempt home in the new built development of closely spaced single-family houses.\nWendy Martinez, a 41-year-old housewife, said her only contact with the Turpins came as she passed the house at night in October. Four children were installing sod in the yard while the mother watched from the door, and none responded when Martinez said hello.\n\"They were very, like, afraid,\" she said of the children. \"Like they had never seen people before.\"\nPolice said six of the couple's children were minors, while the other seven were over 18.\nThe siblings told officers that they were starving and police did not give the parents' motive for holding the children captive.\nA Facebook page that appeared to have been created by the parents showed the couple dressed in wedding clothes, surrounded by 10 girls in matching purple plaid dresses and three male children in suits.\nCalifornia state records list David Turpin as the principal of the Sandcastle Day School, with its address at the Turpin house.\nRecords show the Turpins filed for bankruptcy in 2011. Nancy Trahan, who works in the Temecula, California, law office that handled the bankruptcy, said the couple were friendly and spoke highly of their children.\n\"They seemed like very nice people,\" she said by telephone.\nThe Turpins are due in court on Thursday.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-16T09:48:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-16T09:49:07.001+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
