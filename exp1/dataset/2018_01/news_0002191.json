It didn’t require any force,” Monmouth County Prosecutor Christopher Gramiccioni told reporters on Monday morning, the New York Daily News reported. \nThe victims were identified as the suspect’s father, Steven Kologi, 44; mother Linda Kologi, 42; sister Brittany Kologi, 18; and family friend Mary Schultz, 70. \nThe shooter apparently used a Century Arms semi-automatic rifle, the statement said. \nReporting by Daniel Trotta; Editing by James Dalgleish\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-01T15:45:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-01T15:59:43.002+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
