Scrapping the reform has been estimated to cost around 100 billion euros (£88.6 billion) over the next five years. \nThe anti-establishment 5-Star Movement wants to raise the budget deficit above EU limits and introduce a minimum income of 780 euros ($950) per month. \nMonti, who unsuccessfully formed his own party to try to retain power at the last election in 2013, said of the centre-right’s flat tax proposal: “You can do it, as you can do many negative things with the economy.” \nHe warned that such proposals risked “pushing the country to a precipice” which would probably require tax hikes later on. \nHe also had harsh words for his predecessor as prime minister, Silvio Berlusconi, whose Forza Italia (Go Italy!) party is rising in opinion polls. \n“What I find extraordinary is that people are erasing their memory and not considering at all how he governed,” Monti said. \nForza Italia’s lower house speaker, Renato Brunetta, hit back, saying Monti’s government “sold Italy out” to the EU and called his comments “ridiculous and pathetic.” Reporting by Gavin Jones; Editing by Robin Pomeroy", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-17T16:58:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-17T17:24:44.027+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
