The Canary Wharf financial district is seen at dusk in London, Britain, November 17, 2017. REUTERS/Toby Melville \nThe FOS rules on customer complaints that banks and insurers have not been able to resolve. \nIts chief executive Caroline Wayman said faster payments and loans taken out with a few clicks on a mobile phone are services that on the whole are to be welcomed. \nBut the FOS sees “rising tension” between the push to offer more products and the need to protect consumer data. \n“That is an area to watch really,” Wayman told parliament’s Treasury Select Committee. \nNew European Union rules were introduced last week to allow authorized firms to tap the bank account history of consumers - with their permission - to see if they would benefit from cheaper services elsewhere. \nThe FOS spends much of its time handling complaints about misselling payment protection insurance (PPI). It has become Britain’s costliest financial scandal, forcing banks to pay out 28.8 billion pounds in compensation since January 2011. \nRegulators have set an August 2019 deadline for PPI claims, and Wayman said the FOS was getting ready in case there is a “rush to the finish” with many last-minute complaints. \nGrowth in payday loan complaints was, however, probably the fastest in the FOS workload at present, she said.
