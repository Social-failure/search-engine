Non-interest income improved 24 percent due to higher income from bancassurance and the sale of investments.\nStill, growth was moderated by a 27 percent rise in provisions from a year earlier to 537 million dirhams. Operating expenses climbed by 4 percent from the quarter before as marketing and information technology costs rose.\n$1 = 3.6730 UAE dirham Reporting By Tom Arnold; Editing by Subhranshu Sahu\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-01-16T13:45:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-17T20:16:03.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
