If it does not, the executive could call on other member states to prepare sanctions.\n“We are in a, well, constructive dialogue with the Polish government. I received the new Polish prime minister in Brussels and both of us made an effort to unite our opinions,” Juncker told the European Parliament.\n“We are not at war with Poland. We have a dispute with the Polish government. Article 7 of the treaty is not an article of sanction, but an article of confirmation and warning. So people should stop, also in Poland, making out as if we are to sanction Poland come what may.”\nReporting by Philip Blenkinsop; Editing by Hugh Lawson\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-17T12:04:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-17T12:15:10.011+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
