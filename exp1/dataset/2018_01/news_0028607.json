The iceblocks carried GPS trackers to aid retrieval. \n“This is the first time we find cigarettes underneath the ice. However, smugglers continuously attempt to use that stretch of the river,” border guard spokesman Rokas Pukinskas told Reuters. “The imagination of these people knows no limits.” 1,500 packs of cigarettes found being smuggled under a block of ice flowing on river Neris from Belarus are seen near village of Moliai, Lithuania January 19, 2018 in this photo provided by State Border Guard Service.

That was the highest ratio in the European Union after Latvia, Greece and Ireland, the auditing firm said. \nMost come from Belarus, where taxes on tobacco are far lower than in Lithuania, and some are then sold on for even larger profits in countries such as Britain and Ireland, KPMG said. \nThe Lithuanian government has said it lost 50 million euros in unpaid taxes in 2015 alone due to tobacco smuggling.
