The unit posted earnings before interest tax, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) of $169 million.\nSpectrum said the sale will allow it to focus on its remaining businesses - hardware, auto care and pet and gardening products.\nFor Energizer, the deal adds heft to its batteries unit, while also expanding its international business.\nSpectrum said it expects to use proceeds to pay down debt, reinvest in its core businesses both organically and through bolt-on acquisitions, and repurchase shares.\nEnergizer said it intends to fund the deal through existing cash and committed debt facilities, expected to consist of a new term loan and senior notes.\nBarclays was the financial adviser to Energizer, while RBC Capital Markets advised Spectrum Brands. The deal is expected to close before the end of this year, the companies said.
