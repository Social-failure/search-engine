It happened here. But I‘m still young, so I’ve got time.” \nThe level of tennis produced in the first three sets was so high it looked like a future grand slam final.

But this was a top-10 level match from the start till the end of the fourth set, and for him until the end,” Zverev said. \n“When he plays like that, there are very, very few people who will beat him.” \nThere was nothing between the players in the first set until Zverev piled on the pressure in the 12th game with a couple of rasping baseline winners before prevailing in a 26-stroke rally that ended with a Chung error.
