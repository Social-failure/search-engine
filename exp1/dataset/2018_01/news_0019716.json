( bit.ly/2maIfz6 ) \nOklahoma-based SandRidge, which emerged from bankruptcy last year, had said in November it would pay $746 million for rival Bonanza Creek to expand its presence in the Denver-Julesburg Basin of Colorado. \nIcahn, the largest shareholder with a 13.5 percent stake, had called the offer “value-destroying”, forcing SandRidge to give to call off the deal. \n“We believe the current directors were remiss in attempting to ram through a dilutive, overpriced and value-destroying acquisition without at the very least reaching out and discussing this with the company’s shareholders,” the activist investor wrote in the letter. \nHe also criticized Chief Executive James Bennett for the company’s actions under his management. “We question why you refuse to hold James Bennett accountable for his history with SandRidge during a period of massive value destruction,” Icahn said in the letter. \nIcahn also demanded the company either terminate a “poison pill” shareholder rights plan announced in November or raise its threshold to 25 percent from 10 percent. \nSandRidge spokeswoman declined to comment on Icahn’s letter.
