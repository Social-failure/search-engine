A decision is likely in the next few days, the person added.\nSoFi did not respond to CNBC's requests for comment. The Wall Street Journal first reported the news.\nNoto was formerly a banker at Goldman Sachs . He has long chased the dream of becoming a chief executive, according to Recode. A revolving door of executives at Twitter has not included Noto. Evercore ISI highlighted Noto's \"constant presence,\" saying he \"has been a reassuring force for investors even amidst the stock's volatile performance over the past several years.\"\n\" New leadership would compound challenges to the stock, should results deviate from the current narrative of rebounding growth,\" the firm wrote. \nTwitter declined CNBC's request for comment, saying the company's policy is not to comment on rumors and speculation.\nTwitter's stock has risen nearly 43 percent over the last year.\nâ€” CNBC's Sally Shin and Patricia Martell contributed to this report.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-22T15:05:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-22T15:36:35.027+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
