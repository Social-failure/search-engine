Fore, UNICEF’s executive director, made the warning after visiting some of the areas most devastated by the war.\n“70 percent of the children are out of school, that is highest in the world. There is too much violence,” she said.\n“If we don’t help... we are going to lose this generation and that would be tragic for South Sudan because a country cannot build itself without this next generation of young people.”\nFore said she had visited towns in the country’s north and witnessed widespread malnutrition among children and warned: “We are heading into the dry season... we might lose up to a quarter of a million children in South Sudan.”\nTens of thousands are estimated to have died in the conflict which has also displaced a quarter of the country’s population of 12 million.\nChildren play a board game in the United Nations Mission in South Sudan (UNMISS) Protection of Civilian site (CoP), near Bentiu, northern South Sudan, February 9, 2017.
