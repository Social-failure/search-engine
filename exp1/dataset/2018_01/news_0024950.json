The militants also said they would target the Nigerian oil company Brittania-U.\nShell operates the Bonga and EA fields while Chevron is the operator of Agbami. Akpo stakeholders include Total, China’s CNOOC, Brazil’s Petrobras and Nigeria’s Sapetro.\nRepresentatives of Shell and Chevron declined to comment and there was no immediate statement from the other companies.\nAttacks on pipelines and other facilities in the Niger Delta in 2016 cut Nigeria’s crude production from a peak of 2.2 million barrels per day (mbpd) to near 1 mbpd - the lowest level seen in Africa’s top oil producer in at least 30 years.\nFILE PHOTO: People ride in canoes and speedboats at Swali jetty near the banks of the Nun River on the outskirts of the Bayelsa state capital, Yenagoa, in Nigeria's delta region October 8, 2015. REUTERS/Akintunde Akinleye/File Photo That, combined with low oil prices, pushed the OPEC member into its first recession in a quarter of a century - crude sales make up two-thirds of government revenue and most of its foreign exchange.\nThe militants agreed to a ceasefire in August 2016 - a development that helped pull Nigeria back out of recession in the second quarter of last year. But they called off the truce in November.\nAny resumption of attacks would pile pressure on Nigeria’s President Muhammadu Buhari who is also facing separatist groups in the southeast, Islamist militants in the northeast and elections in 2019. He has not said whether he will stand.\nThe government has held talks to address grievances over poverty and oil pollution in the Delta for more than a year but community groups say no progress has been made.\nThe militant group said talks “have not achieved any meaningful results”.\n“While promising a brutal outpour of our wrath, which shall shake the coffers of the failed Nigerian nation, our demand unambiguously is for the government to restructure this country,” said the group, calling for the Niger Delta to have direct control over its resources.\nEmmanuel Ibe Kachikwu, the minister of state for petroleum, declined to comment.\nThe Niger Delta Avengers bombed the Forcados sub-sea pipeline in 2016, a strike which involved the use of divers. No substantial attacks have been carried out by any groups in the Delta region since January 2017.\nAdditional reporting by Libby George in London and Felix Onuah in Abuja; Editing by Gareth Jones and Andrew Heavens\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-17T12:24:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-17T12:40:28.009+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
