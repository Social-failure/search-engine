Slideshow (2 Images) \nHe guided the delicate putt home for another birdie, moving to five under and into a tie for 19th. \nWoods, 42, is playing his first official tournament since undergoing a spinal fusion last April. \nThe 14-times major champion has on the whole bettered expectations this week, a little rusty at times but showing that his body is healthy again and that better things probably lie ahead as he gets back his tournament sharpness. \nAt the top of the leaderboard, Swede Alex Noren and American J.B. Holmes were tied at 11 under after two holes, one stroke ahead of American Ryan Palmer.
