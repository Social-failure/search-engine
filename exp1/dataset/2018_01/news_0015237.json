It issued a $630 million Formosa bond last year, led by Standard Chartered, and a $1.1 billion Formosa bond in 2016. \nOther banks in the region have sold debt in the same market, which is considered attractive from an issuer perspective because the cost of issuance for five-year maturities is lower than for a vanilla bond. \nAbu Dhabi Commercial Bank (ADCB), Abu Dhabi’s second largest bank by assets, recently raised $540 million through the sale of a Formosa bond, sources told Reuters this week, and other banks in the Gulf are discussing potential debt sales, said one of the sources. \nSeparately, Qatar National Bank is also raising a $3 billion loan, which would refinance an existing debt facility due in March. Bank of America Merrill Lynch, Barclays, Deutsche Bank, MUFG, SMBC, Mizuho Bank, United Overseas Bank, Banca Intesa Sanpaolo and Standard Chartered are leading the facility, sources told Reuters in December. \nThe deal is now being syndicated to a larger group of banks, banking sources said.
