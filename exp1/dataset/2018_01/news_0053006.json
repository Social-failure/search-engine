It’s been on the cards for some time,” said Ken Odeluga, market analyst at City Index. \n“With a good ... return so far this month in the bag, it makes a lot of sense to take some money off the table,” Odeluga added. \nOn the day, financials took more than 15 points off the index, while materials and energy together sliced off around 14 points. \nShares in miner Anglo American were the biggest fallers, down 2.4 percent, while peers Antofagasta, Glencore and BHP Billiton were down between 1.3 percent to 1.7 percent. \nAmong banks, RBS and Barclays were both down around 2 percent. \nMore defensive stocks were the biggest risers, with consumer goods group Reckitt Benckiser up 1.3 percent as a weaker pound helped big, international stocks gain ground. \nOutside of the blue chips, earnings and deal-making were in focus. Shares in UBM were the top gainers among mid caps, up 3.6 percent after Informa sealed its takeover of the conference organiser. Informa’s shares edged 0.8 percent higher. \nDomino’s Pizza rose 2.2 percent, touching their highest level since March 2017 after its fourth quarter sales beat estimates. The pizza delivery firm also said that its annual pretax profit would be slightly ahead of market expectations. \n“(Domino‘s) update today shows good progress in Q4,” analysts at Stifel said in a note. \n“This demonstrates that Domino’s has regained its growth momentum following difficult trading conditions at the beginning of the year,” Stifel analysts added.
