Both figures beat Reuters forecasts, and they widened the trade surplus to 22.3 billion euros ($26.61 billion) from 19.9 billion euros in October.\nThe figures and buoyant business sentiments suggest “that the German economy ended 2017 with a bang after the third quarter’s impressive 0.8 percent expansion,” Jennifer McKeown of Capital Economics wrote in a note.\nSoon after the data, the government raised its 2017 growth forecast to 2.2 percent from a previous estimate of 2.0 percent.\n“The economy is stable,” Deputy Economy Minister Matthias Machnig said. “And we assume that it will continue at about the same level.”\nA construction site at the river Spree is pictured in Berlin, Germany, November 27, 2017.

REUTERS/Fabian Bimmer/Files The rise in November’s output confirmed economists’ assumption that a 1.2 percent drop in October was caused by limited factors, namely two public holidays.\nA breakdown of the output data showed the main drivers were capital and consumer goods spending as well as construction.\nThe Statistics Office will publish on Thursday full-year gross domestic product figures for 2017, which are forecast to show 2.4 percent growth. Some analysts expect it to do better.\n“German GDP looks set to have risen by slightly more than our above-consensus forecast of 2.5 percent in 2017 and we expect a similarly strong pace of growth this year,” McKeown said.\n($1 = 0.8379 euros)\nAdditional reporting by Rene Wagner and Gernot Heller, writing by Joseph Nasr,; editing by Larry King\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-09T12:54:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-09T13:19:20.003+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
