A full takeover of the Norwalk, Conn., company isn’t on the table, one of the people said. No deal appears imminent and one may not be reached. \nShould there be a change of control of Xerox, it would mark the end of the independence of a stalwart of American industry that was an early technological trailblazer that has been bedeviled by a drop off in demand for office printing. A deal would give both Fujifilm 4901, -1.79% and Xerox a chance to root out costs and make their legacy businesses more efficient, some of the people said. \nXerox shares XRX, +0.53% , which topped out at more than $150 in the late ’90s, now trade at just over $30 amid a continued slump in sales and profit. Xerox’s market value stands at roughly $7.7 billion; it also has more than $4 billion of net debt.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-11T03:34:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-11T03:40:58.007+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
