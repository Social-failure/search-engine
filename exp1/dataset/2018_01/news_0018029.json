The advance-decline line is making new highs. It's a pretty broad move,\" he noted.\n\"You haven't even inverted the yield curve. Credit is still on fire, the fundamental backdrop is terrific and earnings are going up. That creates an environment for ultimate upside,\" Dwyer added.\nBut with sentiment in the stock market so strong, Dwyer predicts getting there could get \"a little sloppy.\"\n\"I don't think you have to qualify\" a correction as a 10 percent drop, he said, referencing the term's commonly accepted definition. \"But I certainly think that you will correct more than we did last year,\" he said â€” adding that he can't specifically identify what could push stocks lower.\nFor now, the market has been on fire. The S&P 500 just completed its best 10-day start to a year in 15 years. Plus, the Dow now has three 200 point gains this year. There were only six of them in all of 2017. \n\"You don't need to chase the market, but you better be ready when it dips,\" Dwyer said. \nAnd if that happens, Dwyer sees financials , industrials and information technology as the big winners.\nVote Vote to see results Total Votes: Not a Scientific Survey.
