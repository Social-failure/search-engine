Currently we are significantly lower,” he added. Market researchers estimate Adidas’ share of the U.S. market at about 10 percent, implying a goal to at least double it.\nAdidas has been taking market share in North America and China from its main competitor Nike ( NKE.N ), and hopes the launch of new team kits before this year’s soccer World Cup will revive its relatively weak sales in Europe.\nAn Adidas logo is pictured on a shoe before the company annual general meeting in Fuerth near Nuremberg, Germany, May 11, 2017. REUTERS/Michaela Rehle Growth in the U.S. market has, however, “been too fast for our infrastructure”, Ohlmeyer said, adding that Adidas would build out its logistics capacity there this year to clear supply bottlenecks.\nAdidas expects to keep its Reebok brand, which has undergone a restructuring and is expected to return to growth in the United States this year, he said, although it is not yet making money.\n“The brand is far from the level that we are striving for,” said Ohlmeyer, who started the job last May.\nAdidas will also this year open a new warehouse facility in the German state of Lower Saxony to help scale up its e-commerce business, he said. Online sales rose by around half last year to 1.5 billion euros ($1.83 billion).\n($1 = 0.8201 euros)\nReporting by Douglas Busvine; editing by Clelia Oziel\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-13T15:34:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-13T15:42:12.004+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
