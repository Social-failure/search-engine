Niki’s landing and take-off rights - or slots which airlines that have been grounded too long can lose - are its most attractive assets, along with its workers. \nIn his letter to Niki employees - of which there were around 1,000 in December, although some have quit since - Lauda said he could finance his bid without any problems, but did not give figures or details. \nA spokeswoman declined to comment further. IAG has offered jobs for 740 employees, 20 million euros ($24.5 million) and an additional 16.5 million euros in liquidity for Niki. \n“My Laudamotion GmbH has an AOC (certificate to allow commercial flight operations) and an operating permit and can take over (Niki‘s) slots immediately,” Lauda said in his letter. \n“All Niki employees will get a job offer ... Not only will flight operations be taken over but also administration and technology (operations).” \n($1 = 0.8152 euros)", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-17T21:46:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-17T22:02:49.003+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
