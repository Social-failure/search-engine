Britain’s sugar tax, which comes into effect in April, is expected to add further pressure. \nAs UK businesses grapple with the expected implications of Brexit, several companies have announced job cuts, including Britvic ( BVIC.L ) and Unilever ( ULVR.L ) ( UNc.AS ), which are exiting a joint site in Norwich.
