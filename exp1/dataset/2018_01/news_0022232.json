Yet to be decided, however, are other costs like building and maintaining the rolling stock.\n“The formula is, whatever you need to build from your station right up to the international boundary, it’s your cost,” said Abdul Rahman Dahlan, a minister in Najib’s government.\nDiscussions between officials from the two countries had gone smoothly so far, he added.\n“It’s moving, our timeline is on. I don’t see any big issues at the moment,” he said, when asked about the project’s timeline.\nSingapore was part of Malaysia after the end of British colonial rule but they separated acrimoniously in 1965, clouding diplomatic and economic dealings for decades.\nThe countries have wrangled previously over wider political issues as well as smaller matters like water supply and road tolls, but those frosty ties have thawed under Najib and Lee.\nThe rail project is a symbol of these closer relations. With a top speed of over 300 kph (186 mph), it is scheduled to be completed by 2026 and will cut the travel time between Kuala Lumpur and Singapore to about 90 minutes from the current four- to five-hour road journey.\nMalaysia said on Sunday that the two nations will sign an agreement for a rapid transit system linking the busy crossing between Malaysia and Singapore during the leaders’ retreat.\n$1 = 3.9560 ringgit Additional reporting by Joseph Sipalan and A.Ananthalakshmi; Editing by Stephen Coates\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-01-15T16:59:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-16T13:23:09.010+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
