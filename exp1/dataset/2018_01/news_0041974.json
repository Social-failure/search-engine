It was a difficult chance, however, as the ball came flush off the bat and the fielder had fractions of a second to react. \nWith hot conditions expected in the afternoon, the likelihood is that the cracks will widen further, making the Wanderers wicket even more of a lottery for the batsmen. \nSouth Africa have an unassailable 2-0 lead in the three-match series, but are seeking a first ever clean-sweep over India.
