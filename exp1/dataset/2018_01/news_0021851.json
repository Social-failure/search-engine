Last year it launched a consultation on taxing and charging for their use.\nIn 2015 the government introduced a charge for plastic bags which has led to an 80 percent reduction in UK plastic bag use since 2015.\nIceland said the continuing use of plastic packaging does not resonate with British public opinion.\n“Other supermarkets, and the retail industry as a whole, should follow suit and offer similar commitments during 2018,” said Iceland’s managing director Richard Walker.\nReporting by James Davey; editing by Kate Holton\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-16T09:56:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-16T10:12:44.008+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
