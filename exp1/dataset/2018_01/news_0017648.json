Factory output was just above the 4.7 percent annual rise forecast in a Reuters poll, and up from the 3.4 percent growth in October. Manufacturing sector output expanded 6.7 percent from a year earlier in November, up from 4.2 percent in the previous month, according to data from the Statistics Department.
