For the year ended December 31, 2017, income from continuing operations was $183.0 million or $3.67 per diluted share, an increase of 19.1 percent compared to $153.6 million or $3.12 per diluted share for the year ended December 31, 2016. Included in both the fourth quarter and year-to-date 2017 earnings is the impact of an additional $3.0 million of non-recurring tax expense resulting from the recently enacted Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. Results from continuing operations exclude the impact of the divestiture of Scout Investments, Inc., the company’s institutional investment management subsidiary, which was divested on November 17, 2017.\nNet operating income from continuing operations, a non-GAAP financial measure which is reconciled to the nearest comparable GAAP measure later in this release, was $47.5 million or $0.95 per diluted share for the fourth quarter 2017, compared to $48.9 million or $0.98 per diluted share for the linked quarter and $44.0 million or $0.89 per diluted share for the fourth quarter 2016. These results represent a decrease of 2.9 percent on a linked-quarter basis and an increase of 8.0 percent compared to the fourth quarter 2016. For the year ended December 31, 2017, net operating income from continuing operations was $183.7 million or $3.69 per diluted share, compared to $158.3 million or $3.21 per diluted share for the year ended December 31, 2016.\nSummary of quarterly financial results UMB Financial Corporation (unaudited, dollars in thousands, except per share data) Q4 Q3 Q4 2017 2017 2016 Income from continuing operations $ 47,357 $ 48,872 $ 43,400 Income from discontinued operations-general operations (non-GAAP) 205 3,372 1,278 Income (loss) from discontinued operations-non-GAAP adjustments\n64,399 (4,102 ) (1,744 ) Income (loss) from discontinued operations-total\n64,604 (730 ) (466 ) Net income 111,961 48,142 42,934 Earnings per share from continuing operations (diluted) 0.95 0.98 0.87 Earnings per share from discontinued operations-general operations (non-GAAP) (diluted) - 0.07 0.03 Earnings (losses) per share from discontinued operations-non-GAAP adjustments (diluted)\n1.30 (0.08 ) (0.03 ) Earnings (losses) per share from discontinued operations (diluted)\n1.30 (0.01 ) - Earnings per share (diluted) 2.25 0.97 0.87 GAAP - continuing operations\nReturn on average assets 0.91\n%\n0.95\n%\n0.87\n%\nReturn on average equity 8.72 9.17 8.67 Efficiency ratio 68.90 67.25 69.55 Non-GAAP - continuing operations\nOperating return on average assets 0.91\n%\n0.96\n%\n0.88\n%\nOperating return on average equity 8.75 9.18 8.79 Operating efficiency ratio 68.80\n67.22\n69.15\nSummary of year-to-date financial results UMB Financial Corporation (unaudited, dollars in thousands, except per share data) December December YTD YTD 2017 2016 Income from continuing operations $ 182,976 $ 153,634 Income from discontinued operations-general operations (non-GAAP)\n8,369 8,197 Income (loss) from discontinued operations-non-GAAP adjustments\n55,760 (3,030 ) Income from discontinued operations-total 64,129 5,167 Net income 247,105 158,801 Earnings per share from continuing operations (diluted) 3.67 3.12 Earnings per share from discontinued operations-general operations (non-GAAP) (diluted) 0.17 0.17 Earnings (losses) per share from discontinued operations-non-GAAP adjustments (diluted)\n1.12 (0.07 ) Earnings per share from discontinued operations (diluted) 1.29 0.10 Earnings per share (diluted) 4.96 3.22 GAAP - continuing operations\nReturn on average assets 0.90\n%\n0.78\n%\nReturn on average equity 8.79 7.74 Efficiency ratio 68.56 71.50 Non-GAAP - continuing operations\nOperating return on average assets 0.90\n%\n0.81\n%\nOperating return on average equity 8.83 7.98 Operating efficiency ratio 68.45 70.71 “Results for the fourth quarter 2017 were driven by loan growth, fueled by CRE and construction lending, strong credit metrics and continued growth in net interest margin,” said Mariner Kemper, chairman and chief executive officer. “For the full year, we earned a record $183.0 million, or $3.67 per diluted share, an increase of 19.1 percent compared to $153.6 million or $3.12 per diluted share in 2016. These results were driven by a 12.8 percent year-over-year increase in net interest income with continued favorable pricing and increased loan balances. In 2017, average loan balances increased 8.5 percent and stood at $10.8 billion.”\nDiscussion of results from continuing operations\nSummary of revenue UMB Financial Corporation (unaudited, dollars in thousands) Q4 Q3 Q4 CQ vs. CQ vs. 2017 2017 2016 LQ PY Net interest income $ 146,346 $ 140,858 $ 131,456 $ 5,488 $ 14,890 Noninterest income: Trust and securities processing 44,234 45,060 42,331 (826 ) 1,903 Trading and investment banking 5,015 4,453 5,040 562 (25 ) Service charges on deposit accounts 21,364 21,510 20,949 (146 ) 415 Insurance fees and commissions 388 425 833 (37 ) (445 ) Brokerage fees 6,127 5,815 4,674 312 1,453 Bankcard fees 17,617 17,427 16,113 190 1,504 Gains on sales of securities available for sale, net 54 2,390 - (2,336 ) 54 Equity earnings (losses) on alternative investments\n285 (584 ) 504 869 (219 ) Other 10,949 7,810 7,786 3,139 3,163 Total noninterest income $ 106,033 $ 104,306 $ 98,230 $ 1,727 $ 7,803 Total Revenue $ 252,379 $ 245,164 $ 229,686 $ 7,215 $ 22,693 Net interest margin 3.21\n%\n3.16\n%\n3.00\n%\nTotal noninterest income as a % of total revenue 42.0 % 42.5 % 42.8 % Net interest income\nOn a linked quarter basis, the increase in net interest income was driven by both a 2.1 percent increase in average earning assets and a five basis point improvement in net interest margin. Earning asset yields improved four basis points from the linked quarter driven by improved loan yields of seven basis points to 4.40 percent, in part driven by favorable re-pricing and volume changes within the loan portfolio. The cost of interest-bearing liabilities remained flat at 55 basis points while the mix changed from a decrease in federal funds borrowings and an increase in interest-bearing deposits. On a year-over-year basis, the increase in net interest income was driven by a 7.1 percent or $738.7 million increase in average loans as well as higher average loan yields, which increased 44 basis points from one year ago, primarily driven by higher interest rates and mix changes. For the fourth quarter 2017, average earning assets stood at $19.3 billion, which is an increase of 4.2 percent over the fourth quarter 2016.\nNoninterest income\nFourth quarter 2017 noninterest income increased $1.7 million, or 1.7 percent, on a linked quarter basis largely due to: an increase of $3.1 million in other noninterest income primarily due to an increase in company-owned and bank-owned life insurance income; a $0.9 million increase in equity earnings on alternative investments; which were partially offset by a $2.3 million decrease in gains on sales of available-for-sale securities. Noninterest income in the fourth quarter of 2017 improved $7.8 million, or 7.9 percent, compared to the same quarter in 2016 primarily driven by: a $3.2 million increase in other noninterest income primarily due to increases in company-owned and bank-owned life insurance income; a $1.0 million increase in wealth management revenue, a $0.5 million increase in fund servicing revenue, and a $0.5 million increase in corporate trust revenue all recorded in trust and securities processing; a $1.5 million increase in bankcard fees primarily due to increased interchange income; and an increase of $1.5 million in brokerage fee income primarily driven by higher 12b-1 income.\nNoninterest expense\nSummary of noninterest expense UMB Financial Corporation (unaudited, dollars in thousands) Q4 Q3 Q4 CQ vs. CQ vs. 2017 2017 2016 LQ PY Salaries and employee benefits $ 107,656 $ 99,749 $ 96,765 $ 7,907 $ 10,891 Occupancy, net 11,148 11,285 11,259 (137 ) (111 ) Equipment 18,690 17,880 17,530 810 1,160 Supplies and services 4,211 4,076 4,660 135 (449 ) Marketing and business development 6,540 5,056 5,935 1,484 605 Processing fees 11,238 11,151 8,887 87 2,351 Legal and consulting 6,045 5,844 6,694 201 (649 ) Bankcard 4,405 5,130 4,558 (725 ) (153 ) Amortization of other intangible assets 1,641 1,715 2,051 (74 ) (410 ) Regulatory fees 3,825 3,798 3,687 27 138 Other 7,160 6,137 5,821 1,023 1,339 Total noninterest expense $ 182,559 $ 171,821 $ 167,847 $ 10,738 $ 14,712 GAAP noninterest expense for the fourth quarter of 2017 was $182.6 million and increased $10.7 million, or 6.2 percent from the linked quarter. On a non-GAAP basis, operating noninterest expense (as reconciled later in this release) was $182.3 million for the fourth quarter 2017, an increase of $10.5 million, or 6.1 percent, compared to the linked quarter, and an increase of $15.4 million, or 9.2 percent, compared to the fourth quarter 2016. The linked quarter increase in operating noninterest expense was driven by: a $7.8 million increase in salaries and employee benefits expense primarily driven by a $5.4 million increase in bonus and commission expense, and a $2.0 million increase in employee benefits partially due to increased incentive compensation and profit sharing expense from improved company performance; an increase of $1.5 million in marketing and business development related to timing of multiple projects; and a $1.0 million increase in other noninterest expense driven by a $1.0 million contribution made to the UMB Financial Corporation Charitable Foundation. The year-over-year increase in operating noninterest expense of $15.4 million, or 9.2 percent, was primarily driven by: an $11.1 million increase in salaries and benefits expense driven by a $4.2 million increase in bonus and commissions expense, an increase of $2.8 million in salary and wage expense, and an increase of $4.0 million in other employee benefits. These increases were primarily driven by improved company performance during 2017; higher processing expenses related to investments for regulatory requirements, cyber security, and the ongoing modernization of the company’s core systems; and increased charitable contributions and derivative expense, both recorded in other noninterest expense.\nFull Year 2017 Financial Discussion\nThe 12.8 percent year-over-year increase in net interest income was driven by benefits from higher short-term interest rates, favorable pricing and increased loan balances. In 2017, average loan balances increased $850.8 million and average loan yields increased 38 basis points. Average interest-bearing liabilities increased $649.9 million, while cost of funds increased 24 basis points. Full year noninterest income increased $21.1 million, or 5.2 percent, due to: a $5.3 million increase in wealth management revenue, a $3.3 million increase in fund servicing revenue, and a $1.8 million increase in corporate trust revenue all recorded in trust and securities processing; a $6.7 million increase in company-owned and bank-owned life insurance income recorded in other noninterest income; a $5.4 million increase in brokerage fees, primarily driven by higher 12b-1 income; a $5.0 million increase in credit card interchange income recorded in bankcard fees; partially offset by a $4.3 million decrease in gains on sales of available-for-sale securities and a $3.8 million decrease in equity earnings on alternative investments. Full year noninterest expense increased $38.4 million, or 5.8 percent, primarily due to increases in salary and employee benefit expense of $23.8 million due to improved company performance, processing fees of $6.3 million, and equipment expense of $5.7 million. On a non-GAAP basis, operating noninterest expense, which excludes the impact of acquisition expenses and other items as reconciled later in this release, was $704.0 million for full-year 2017, an increase of $44.5 million, or 6.8 percent, compared to the full-year 2016.\nIncome Taxes\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017, the company’s effective tax rate remained flat at 22.6 percent as compared to the same period a year earlier.\nOn December 22, 2017 the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act was signed into law. The new legislation includes numerous changes to existing federal income tax laws and regulations, including a permanent reduction in the federal corporate income tax rate to 21 percent effective January 1, 2018. As a result of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, the company was required to revalue its deferred taxes.\nBased on currently available information, the company recorded additional income tax expense of $3.0 million during the fourth quarter of 2017 resulting from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. The company’s revaluation of its deferred taxes may be subject to further refinement as additional information becomes available and further analysis is completed.\nBalance Sheet\nAverage total assets for the fourth quarter 2017 were $20.7 billion, an increase of $410.5 million from the linked quarter, and up from $19.9 billion for the same period in 2016.\nSummary of average loans and leases - QTD Average UMB Financial Corporation (unaudited, dollars in thousands) Q4 Q3 Q4 CQ vs. CQ vs. 2017 2017 2016 LQ PY Commercial $ 4,438,241 $ 4,539,302 $ 4,369,173 $ (101,061 ) $ 69,068 Asset-based loans 326,845 278,479 231,035 48,366 95,810 Factoring loans 212,123 173,876 110,866 38,247 101,257 Commercial credit card 172,193 174,892 150,630 (2,699 ) 21,563 Real estate - construction 835,715 782,898 674,367 52,817 161,348 Real estate - commercial 3,394,232 3,284,871 3,089,946 109,361 304,286 Real estate - residential 619,985 603,865 553,770 16,120 66,215 Real estate - HELOC 649,268 668,340 713,528 (19,072 ) (64,260 ) Consumer credit card 247,284 239,529 271,909 7,755 (24,625 ) Consumer other 164,667 140,344 146,779 24,323 17,888 Leases 24,163 24,758 34,020 (595 ) (9,857 ) Total loans\n$ 11,084,716 $ 10,911,154 $ 10,346,023 $ 173,562 $ 738,693 Average loans for the fourth quarter 2017 increased 1.6 percent, on a linked-quarter basis, and 7.1 percent, compared to fourth quarter 2016.\nSummary of average securities - QTD Average UMB Financial Corporation (unaudited, dollars in thousands) Q4 Q3 Q4 CQ vs. CQ vs. 2017 2017 2016 LQ PY Securities available for sale: U.S. Treasury $ 38,776 $ 47,216 $ 182,891 $ (8,440 ) $ (144,115 ) U.S. Agencies\n14,753 22,743 248,329 (7,990 ) (233,576 ) Mortgage-backed 3,484,304 3,564,974 3,586,040 (80,670 ) (101,736 ) State and political subdivisions 2,555,462 2,536,281 2,362,178 19,181 193,284 Corporates 15,880 21,848 67,100 (5,968 ) (51,220 ) Total securities available for sale 6,109,175 6,193,062 6,446,538 (83,887 ) (337,363 ) Securities held to maturity: State and political subdivisions 1,269,058 1,283,258 1,073,509 (14,200 ) 195,549 Trading securities 43,388 49,396 50,925 (6,008 ) (7,537 ) Other securities 63,543 64,294 66,567 (751 ) (3,024 ) Total securities $ 7,485,164 $ 7,590,010 $ 7,637,539 $ (104,846 ) $ (152,375 ) The year-over-year growth in the company’s held to maturity securities portfolio is due to increased activity in private placement bonds, primarily used to refinance existing revenue bonds in the healthcare and education sectors.

This information supplements the results that are reported according to generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (GAAP) and should not be viewed in isolation from, or as a substitute for, GAAP results. The differences between the non-GAAP financial measures—net operating income, operating EPS, operating ROE, operating ROA, operating noninterest expense, operating efficiency ratio, net income from discontinued operations-general operations, and earnings per share from discontinued operations-general operations—and the nearest comparable GAAP financial measures are reconciled later in this release. The company believes that these non-GAAP financial measures and the reconciliations may be useful to investors because they adjust for fair value adjustments, acquisition- and severance-related items, one-time marketing agent termination costs, and divestiture costs that management does not believe reflect the company’s fundamental operating performance.\nNet operating income for the relevant period is defined as GAAP net income, adjusted to reflect the impact of excluding the following: (i) fair value adjustments on contingent consideration for the acquisitions of Reams Asset Management Company (Reams), (ii) expenses related to acquisitions and divestitures, (iii) non-acquisition related severance expense, and (v) the cumulative tax impact of the previous adjustments. The company believes that the financial impact of excluding non-acquisition related severance expense will be immaterial in the near future. It is excluded from certain GAAP financial measures as it has an unusually large impact on the company’s financial statements.\nOperating EPS (diluted) is calculated as earnings per share as reported, adjusted to reflect, on a per share basis, the impact of excluding the non-GAAP adjustments described in clauses (i)-(v) above for the relevant period. Operating ROE is calculated as net operating income, divided by the company’s average total shareholders’ equity for the relevant period. Operating ROA is calculated as net operating income, divided by the company’s average assets for the relevant period. Operating noninterest expense for the relevant period is defined as GAAP noninterest expense, adjusted to reflect the pre-tax impact of non-GAAP adjustments described in clauses (i)-(iii) above. Operating efficiency ratio is calculated as the company’s operating noninterest expense, net of amortization of other intangibles, divided by the company’s total revenue (calculated as tax equivalent net interest income, plus noninterest income, less gains on sales of securities available for sale, net).\nNet income from discontinued operations-general operations for the relevant period is defined as GAAP income from discontinued operations, adjusted to reflect the impact of excluding non-GAAP adjustments (iii) and (v) above, and (iv) divestiture expenses related to Scout, (vii) the gain on sale of Scout, and (viii) expenses related to the buy-out and termination of certain marketing and referral agreements in Scout’s business. The company believes that the financial impact of excluding non-acquisition related severance expense will be immaterial in the near future. It is excluded from certain GAAP financial measures as it has an unusually large impact on the company’s financial statements.\nEarnings per share from discontinued operations-general operations (diluted) is calculated as earnings per share from discontinued operations (diluted) as reported, adjusted to reflect, on a per share basis, the impact of excluding non-GAAP adjustment (iii)-(v), and (vii)-(viii) above for the relevant period.\nForward-Looking Statements:\nThis release contains, and our other communications may contain, forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.
