The jury instead convicted him of manslaughter, essentially a crime of passion. \nProsecutors said after the trial they were happy with the verdict and that McKnight’s family was satisfied as well. \nAssistant District Attorney Seth Shute told reporters Gasser faced a possible prison term of up to 40 years when he is sentenced. \nGasser, who did not take the witness stand in his own defence, told investigators that he shot McKnight from the driver’s seat of his car as the former NFL player stood at Gasser’s open passenger-side window on Dec. 1, 2016. \nAccording to Gasser, he feared for his life when McKnight made an aggressive movement, or lunged in such a way as to attempt to get inside his vehicle. Gasser’s lawyer argued that his client was justified in defending himself with lethal force under Louisiana’s so-called “stand-your-ground” law. \nBut prosecutors said physical evidence, including the lack of gunpowder residue on McKnight’s body, disputed Gasser’s account and showed the two men were farther apart than Gasser has asserted. \nMcKnight played in the NFL as a running back for the New York Jets and Kansas City Chiefs from 2010 through 2014. He later played for the Edmonton Eskimos and Saskatchewan Roughriders in the Canadian Football League.
