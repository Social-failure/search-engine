REUTERS/Thomas Peter “It’s a different crowd at Rod Laver Arena,” he told Reuters. “They obviously root for him but they’re not as young and as wild, they’re more neutral.”\nRod Laver Arena is usually expected to host the cream of the ties and day three of the 2018 championship is no different, with Nadal’s clash with Mayer and Grigor Dimitrov’s meeting with American Mackenzie McDonald the highlights.\nA rash of upsets depleted the bottom half of the women’s draw on Monday but second seed Caroline Wozniacki survived and will pursue her quest for a maiden grand slam title against Croatian Jana Fett.\nFourth seed Elina Svitolina opens the day on the main showcourt against Katerina Siniakova with Nadal-Mayer the final match of the afternoon.\nTop seed Nadal has beaten Argentine Mayer in all four of their previous meetings, including a four-set victory at Flushing Meadows last year on his way to his 16th grand slam title.\nAnother intriguing match-up pairs Denis Shapovalov with French 15th seed Jo-Wilfried Tsonga, a losing finalist at Melbourne Park a decade ago when the Canadian was eight.\nReporting by Nick Mulvenney in Sydney; Editing by John O'Brien\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-16T16:13:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-16T16:22:57.074+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
