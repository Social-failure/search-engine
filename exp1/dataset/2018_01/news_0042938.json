With the water level rising one to two centimetres per hour, the river had hit 5.24 metres at 1 p.m. (1200 GMT/0800 EST) on Wednesday. \nCrunch-time is expected on Friday or Saturday, following more heavy rainfall forecast for Thursday. \nFlooding caused destruction in Paris in 1910, when the Seine rose by 8.65 metres, a level that was topped only once on record, in February 1658.
