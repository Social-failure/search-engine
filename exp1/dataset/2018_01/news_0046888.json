This one is going to boost humanitarian work in the country,” he told Reuters, saying the waiver would run for a year.\nSouth Sudan has been criticized in the past for imposing massive charges on aid groups and their workers to register them to operate in the country.\nThe U.S. Ambassador to the U.N., Nikki Haley, pressed President Salva Kiir at a meeting in Juba last year to facilitate the work of humanitarian groups, securing an order from the president to his troops to provide unfettered access to humanitarian convoys.\nHaley welcomed the waiver, saying the fees charged for work permits for foreign aid workers should also be reviewed.\n“Work permit fees – often ranging between $2,000 to $4,000 per international staff member – remain a much greater financial burden,” she said in a statement.\nReporting by Denis Dumo; Writing by Duncan Miriri; Editing by Mark Potter\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-27T13:38:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-27T13:54:01.022+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
