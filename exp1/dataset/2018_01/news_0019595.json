Several Latino men and Taiwan’s Ang Lee have won the award. \nGerwig, 34, was joined by Mexican Guillermo del Toro for “The Shape of Water,” black first-time director Jordan Peele for racial horror satire “Get Out,” and Britain’s Martin McDonagh for dark comedy “Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri.” British director Christopher Nolan won a fourth DGA nomination for his war drama “Dunkirk.” Director Greta Gerwig arrives to attend the National Board of Review awards gala in New York, U.S., January 9, 2018.

Oscar nominations are announced on Jan. 23 and the Academy Awards ceremony takes place in Hollywood on March 4.
