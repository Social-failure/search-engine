The Notes, which priced at par, will bear interest at a rate of 1.50% per year, payable semiannually in arrears on February 15 and August 15 of each year, beginning on August 15, 2018. The Notes will mature on February 15, 2023, unless repurchased, redeemed or converted in accordance with their terms prior to such date. The Company will have the option to redeem all or any portion of the Notes on or after February 15, 2021, if certain conditions (including that the Company's common stock trades above 130% of the conversion price for a specified period) are met, at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding, the redemption date.\nThe Notes will be convertible based on an initial conversion rate of 22.2748 shares of the Company's common stock per $1,000 principal amount of the Notes, which is equivalent to an initial conversion price of approximately $44.89 per share, which represents a conversion premium of approximately 37.5% to the last reported sale price of $32.65 per share of the Company's common stock on the New York Stock Exchange on January 25, 2018. The conversion rate is subject to adjustment in certain circumstances.
