These results include sales of $90.5 million in our Interconnect, Sensing and Control division that are attributable to our acquisition of the AB Electronic sensing and control (“S&C”) business from TT Electronics, PLC in early October 2017. With continuing favorable market conditions, we saw healthy product demand in most of the markets we serve. As a result of the favorable U.S. tax reform law signed in December, as well as an enacted income tax rate reduction in France, we recorded estimated income tax charges of approximately $129.8 million in the quarter, consisting primarily of a charge for estimated taxes on un-repatriated accumulated overseas earnings.”\nAlso during the quarter, as discussed below, we announced an agreement to acquire Ethertronics Inc. (“Ethertronics”), a privately held manufacturer of passive and active antenna systems. The pending addition of Ethertronics provides an opportunity for AVX to expand our extensive electronic product offering into the rapidly expanding Internet of Things (“IoT”) wireless connectivity space. We are optimistic that the addition of the S&C business and Ethertronics will provide new and exciting growth opportunities for AVX going forward.\nFor the three and nine month periods ended December 31, 2017, net sales were $431.8 million and $1,115.8 million, respectively, compared to net sales of $340.8 million and $983.1 million, respectively, for the same period last year, reflecting the increased sales from our acquisition of the S&C business in addition to healthy global market conditions for our components and interconnect devices.\nProfit from operations for the three and nine month periods ended December 31, 2017 were $45.3 million and $132.5 million, respectively, compared to operating profits of $50.9 million and $118.5 million for the three and nine month periods ended December 31, 2016. Profit from operations for the three and nine month periods ended December 31, 2016 include charges of $12.9 million and $28.1 million, respectively, related to previously disclosed intellectual property damages awards resulting from litigation with respect to patent infringement cases. Additionally, profit from operations for the nine month period ended December 31, 2016 reflects a charge of $3.6 million ($2.3 million after-tax) related to estimated environmental remediation costs resulting from legacy environmental issues at an inactive property.\nNet loss for the quarter ended December 31, 2017 was $93.2 million, or $0.55 per share, reflecting estimated one-time income tax charges of approximately $129.8 million as described above. Net income for the quarter ended December 31, 2016 was $35.5 million, or $0.21 per diluted share.\nNet loss for the nine month period ended December 31, 2017 was $26.9 million, or $0.16 per share, compared to net income of $91.9 million, or $0.55 per diluted share, for the nine month period ended December 31, 2016.\nOn December 29, 2017, AVX Corporation signed a definitive agreement to acquire Ethertronics Inc., a privately held manufacturer of passive and active antenna systems, for $142.0 million in cash and the assumption of $8.0 million of net debt, subject to normal working capital adjustments at closing. Ethertronics is a leader in advanced antenna system technology and manufactures antenna products for wireless applications such as mobile phones, Wi-Fi, defense, aerospace, medical, and IoT. The acquisition of Ethertronics is expected to close at the end of January.\nChief Financial Officer, Kurt Cummings, stated, “Part of our long-term strategy is to continue to foster our financial strength in order to allow flexibility for investments in potential acquisitions, materials, equipment and people to support the long-term growth of the Company. As of December 31, 2017, we had cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments in securities of approximately $1.0 billion and no debt. Additionally, the new U.S. tax law will provide greater flexibility to redirect our global cash resources where they are needed. We continued to use our resources to provide value to our stockholders during the quarter by paying $19.4 million in dividends to stockholders and spending $150.3 million for the acquisition of the S&C business.”\nAVX, headquartered in Fountain Inn, South Carolina, is a leading manufacturer and supplier of a broad line of passive electronic components and related products.\nPlease visit our website at www.avx.com .\nAVX CORPORATION\nConsolidated Condensed Statements of Income\n(unaudited)\n(in thousands, except per share data)\nThree Months Ended Nine Months Ended December 31, December 31, 2016 2017 2016 2017 Net sales $ 340,799 $ 431,795 $ 983,083 $ 1,115,842 Cost of sales 248,539 349,692 743,897 882,620 Intellectual property damages award 12,869 - 28,133 - Gross profit 79,391 82,103 211,053 233,222 Selling, general & admin. expense 28,450 36,772 88,974 100,674 Legal and environmental charges - - 3,600 - Profit from operations 50,941 45,331 118,479 132,548 Other income, net 1,405 2,221 9,199 8,388 Income before income taxes 52,346 47,552 127,678 140,936 Provision for taxes 16,827 140,764 35,750 167,846 Net income (loss) $ 35,519 $ (93,212) $ 91,928 $ (26,910) Basic income (loss) per share $ 0.21 $ (0.55) $ 0.55 $ (0.16) Diluted income (loss) per share $ 0.21 $ (0.55) $ 0.55 $ (0.16) Weighted average common shares outstanding: Basic 167,418 168,313 167,399 168,216 Diluted 167,856 168,313 167,664 168,216 AVX CORPORATION\nConsolidated Condensed Balance Sheets\n(unaudited)\n(in thousands)\nMarch 31, December 31, 2017 2017 Assets Cash and cash equivalents $ 578,634 $ 464,173 Short-term investments in securities 528,748 541,215 Accounts receivable, net 186,804 248,870 Inventories 474,128 497,291 Other current assets 68,090 56,894 Total current assets 1,836,404 1,808,443 Property, plant and equipment, net 239,951 374,976 Goodwill and other intangibles 266,701 307,146 Other assets 134,357 104,452 TOTAL ASSETS $ 2,477,413 $ 2,595,017 Liabilities and Stockholders' Equity Accounts payable $ 80,441 $ 103,266 Income taxes payable and accrued expenses 135,626 169,266 Total current liabilities 216,067 272,532 Other liabilities 44,867 132,366 TOTAL LIABILITIES 260,934 404,898 TOTAL STOCKHOLDERS' EQUITY 2,216,479 2,190,119 TOTAL LIABILITIES AND STOCKHOLDERS' EQUITY $ 2,477,413 $ 2,595,017 This Press Release contains \"forward-looking\" information within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.
