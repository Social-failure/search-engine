When one of the friends tells Yair he spotted him 400 Shekels (about $115), Yair says: “No, that was for the hooker.” \nIn other portions of the recording Yair offers “to arrange” an ex-girlfriend for his friend in order to settle his debts, appears to rate strippers’ skills and appearances and is embarrassed by a late-night phone-call from his mother. \nYair issued a statement in which he said the news report was salacious, the recording illegal and that he was inebriated at the time. \n“I said ridiculous things about women and about other people, which should not have been said. These things do not represent me, the values I was raised on and what I believe in. I regret these and apologise to anyone hurt by them,” said the statement, quoted in Israeli media. \nThe recording has made headlines in Israel, where Yair was criticised for using a state-funded car and driver to take him around strip clubs along with his state-funded security guard. \n“This is terrible moral bankruptcy. Debased, disgusting, rude behavior objectifying women while accompanied by a car and security funded by the state,” opposition lawmaker Shelly Yachimovich said on Facebook. \nSpeaking with reporters in Jerusalem on Tuesday, the prime minister said his son was right to apologize. “My wife and I raised our children to respect any person and to respect all women,” Netanyahu said. \nOne of the friends Netanyahu was with is the son of an Israeli businessman, Kobi Maimon, who has a stake in Israel’s offshore natural gas fields. At the time of the recording Netanyahu’s government was finalizing a deal for their development. \n“Bro, my dad just arranged 20 billion dollars for your dad and you can’t spot me 400 Shekels?” Yair told his friend jokingly as laughter was heard. \nIn a written response issued to the report on Monday, Netanyahu said he was unaware of his son’s friendship with Maimon and that it had no bearing on the gas deal, nor did Yair have any knowledge of it. \nHe called the report wicked gossip and said the media was hounding his family as part of a campaign against his right-wing government. \nNetanyahu, who has a sometimes adversarial relationship with Israeli media, is under police investigation for alleged corruption in two criminal cases. He denies wrongdoing. \nThe 26-year-old Yair Netanyahu has found himself the center of controversy in the past. \nIn September he drew anger in Israel and abroad for posting a cartoon using what the Anti-Defamation League, which monitors anti-Semitism worldwide, described as anti-Semitic imagery in a Facebook post mocking some of his father’s critics. \nIn August, he made another headline-grabbing post after a protester was killed during a white nationalist rally in the U.S. state of Virginia, that suggested hard-left organizations pose more of a danger than neo-Nazi groups.
