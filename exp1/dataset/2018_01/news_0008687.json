The technology will enable so-called “intelligent co-pilot” capabilities based on processing sensor data inside and outside the car. \nSo far, 320 companies involved in self-driving cars - whether software developers, automakers and their suppliers, sensor and mapping companies - are using Nvidia Drive, formerly branded as the Drive PX2, the company said. \nHuang said Baidu and German auto supplier ZF Friedrichshafen AG [ZFF.UL] had selected Nvidia Drive for their AV computing platform development in China. \nNvidia added that its first Xavier processors would be delivered to customers this quarter. The system on a chip delivers 30 trillion operations per second using 30 watts of power. \nNvidia will collaborate with Silicon Valley startup Aurora - co-founded by the former head of Google’s autonomous program, Chris Urmson - to build a new self-driving hardware platform using the Xavier processor, Huang said. \nBets that Nvidia will become a leader in chips for driverless cars, data centers and artificial intelligence have more than doubled its stock price in the past 12 months, making the Silicon Valley company the third-strongest perfomer in the S&P 500 during that time.
