The most important thing is that the changes we bring forward command support on all sides,” he said. \n“I remain confident we can reach a place where the Scottish parliament will give legislative consent to this vitally important piece of legislation.” \nThe bill, part of Prime Minister Theresa May’s strategy for delivering an orderly Brexit, is designed to convert all existing EU laws into domestic ones so that there is clarity after the separation occurs in March 2019. \nBut it has grated in Edinburgh and Cardiff, which currently control policy areas such as health, education, transport and agriculture, because it does not make clear what the status of their devolved powers will be once Brexit happens. \nBoth Welsh and Scottish administrations have said that, as it stands, they will not recommend the bill receives consent in their assemblies. \nUnder Britain’s constitution, the British parliament must seek consent from the Scottish and Welsh assemblies when legislating on policy areas that overlap with their devolved powers. \nWhile they do not have veto powers over the Brexit bill, ignoring their wishes would pressure yet further their already tense relations with London, and could feed public appetite for Scottish independence.
