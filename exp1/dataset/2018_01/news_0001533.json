Intel believes these exploits do not have the potential to corrupt, modify or delete data. Recent reports that these exploits are caused by a 'bug' or a 'flaw' and are unique to Intel products are incorrect.\"\nIntel shares rose 27 percent in 2017 versus AMD's stock 9 percent decline.\nDisclaimer", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-03T15:26:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-03T15:45:25.001+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
