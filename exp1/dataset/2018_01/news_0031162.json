Russia is estimated to have earned an extra $117 million a day and Saudi Arabia $100 million daily by limiting their output and nudging up prices.\nBut the higher prices also brought back U.S. producers, particularly in shale oil, which requires higher prices in order to break even.\nU.S. production rose last year to its highest since 1970 and is expected to keep growing, assuming OPEC and Russia don't decide to increase their own production — a decision of which there is no sign, the IEA says.\nEven the hurricanes of last year didn't hinder the U.S. oil production boom.\nFor now, the extra crude from the U.S. is meeting growing demand as the world economy expands at a strong pace.\nGlobal demand for oil is forecast to grow by 1.3 million barrels a day, the same as the year before. It's not growing faster because some consumers are reducing spending on oil because of the higher prices and switching to other types of energy, like natural gas.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-19T12:25:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-20T03:36:13.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
