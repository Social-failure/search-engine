I think certainly by the spring of 2018 we’ll see forward progress and momentum,” he said. \nThe United States wants to boost exports to Japan in areas such as liquefied natural gas (LNG), farm products and medicines, Hagerty told NHK. \nWorking-level officials from the U.S. Trade Representative’s office will visit Tokyo next week, he added. \nJapan has shown little interest in pursuing a free trade agreement (FTA) with the United States, preferring instead to push for a modified version of the Trans Pacific Partnership (TPP) after President Donald Trump pulled the U.S. from the pact.
