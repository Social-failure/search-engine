The four others have returned to Hong Kong.\nHong Kong, a former British colony, returned to Chinese rule in 1997 with a guarantee of wide-ranging freedoms, including freedom of speech, but critics accuse Communist Party rulers in Beijing of creeping interference in the city’s affairs.\nChinese authorities said Gui was freed in October after serving a two-year sentence for a traffic-related crime in 2003.\nGui’s daughter Angela told Radio Sweden he was taken off a train by plainclothes police while en route to the capital to get medical attention for a neurological ailment.\nSweden’s Foreign Ministry has twice summoned China’s ambassador to Stockholm to explain the situation.\nReporting by Idrees Ali; Editing by Daniel Wallis\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-28T05:12:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-28T05:47:38.010+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
