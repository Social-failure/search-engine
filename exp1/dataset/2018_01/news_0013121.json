REUTERS/JUNG Yeon-Je/Pool South Korea’s Kang did not elaborate on what additional steps South Korea was seeking but a senior foreign ministry official told Reuters it wanted a “voluntary, sincere apology rather than money”.\nSouth Korean activists estimate there may have been as many as 200,000 Korean women forced to work in the brothels.\nThere are 31 surviving women registered with the government, a foreign ministry official said.\nIn 2015, when there were 47, 36 accepted the settlement, a the official said. But others rejected it, and some have been protesting regularly in front of the Japanese Embassy in Seoul.\nSlideshow (2 Images) Those opposed to the 2015 deal want Japan to take legal responsibility and provide due compensation.\nSouth Korean President Moon Jae-in won an election last year after promises on the campaign trail to renegotiate the deal.\nBut he has also vowed to “normalize” ties with Japan.\nThe comfort women issue has been a regular cause for contention between Japan and neighbors China and North and South Korea since the war.\nJapan colonized the Korean peninsula between 1910 and 1945 and occupied parts of China before and after the war.\nJapan says the matter of compensation for the women was settled under a 1965 treaty. It says that in 2015, it agreed to provide the funds to help them heal “psychological wounds”.\n(Refiles to remove extraneous word from paragraph 13.)\nReporting by Hyonhee Shin; Additional reporting by Kaori Kaneko, Nobuhiro Kubo and Linda Sieg in TOKYO; Editing by Paul Tait, Robert Birsel\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-09T12:35:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-09T09:42:32.449+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
