A room previously used for bond trading will be converted into spaces for conferences and events. \nThe exchange’s 19th century building on Boersenplatz in downtown Frankfurt is often used by TV crews when reporting on German financial news even though actual trading at the exchange, which has roots dating back to 1585, is now mostly done electronically. \nDeutsche Boerse rents the trading floor areas in the building, which is owned by the Frankfurt am Main Chamber of Commerce and Industry. It also announced on Monday that it had extended its rental contract to 2048. \nThe company hopes that investing in this landmark will help to spark greater interest among the German public in share trading, startups and IPOs. Germany is Europe’s largest economy, but IPO issuance and stock ownership among the public has lagged the United States and Britain. $1 = 0.8051 euros Reporting by Tom Sims, editing by Louise Heavensd", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-29T13:02:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-29T13:37:06.001+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
