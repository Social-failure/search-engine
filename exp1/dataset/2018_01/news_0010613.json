Sainsbury‘s, the No. 2, reports on Wednesday and Tesco updates on Thursday.\nRival market researcher Nielsen also named Tesco the best Christmas performer among the major grocers on Tuesday, although Asda outpaced it in the shorter December period.\nGrocery inflation stood at 3.7 percent for the period, Kantar said.\n($1 = 0.7394 pounds)\nReporting by Paul Sandle; Editing by Kate Holton and Edmund Blair\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-09T10:24:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-09T10:42:54.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
