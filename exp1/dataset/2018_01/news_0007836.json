The merger still needs approval from Argentina’s CNDC antitrust regulator.\nThe government of business-friendly President Mauricio Macri said in late 2016 it expected Telecom reforms to attract $20 billion in investments over four years.\nReporting by Caroline Stauffer; Editing by Richard Chang\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-05T23:58:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-06T00:08:02.005+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
