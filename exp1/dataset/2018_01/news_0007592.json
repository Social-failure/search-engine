If they are roads, they cannot be one-way,” he said.\nUnveiled in 2013, the Belt and Road project is aimed at connecting China by land and sea to Southeast Asia, Pakistan and Central Asia, and beyond to the Middle East, Europe and Africa.\nXi pledged $124 billion for the plan at a summit in May but it has faced suspicion in Western capitals that it is intended more to assert Chinese influence than Beijing’s professed desire to spread prosperity.\nMacron, who pledged to visit China at least once every year during his mandate, said the new infrastructure and cultural projects promoted by China could also be in France’s and Europe’s interest if done in a spirit of cooperation.\n“These roads cannot be those of a new hegemony, which would transform those that they cross into vassals,” Macron said.\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron and his wife Brigitte Macron pose with China's President Xi Jinping and his wife Peng Liyuan during their meeting in Beijing, China, January 8, 2018.
