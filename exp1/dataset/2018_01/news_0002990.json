He won back-to-back world titles, three consecutive European titles and two Grand Prix Final silver medals. \nHe did not qualify for December’s Grand Prix Final but won the Grand Prix event in France in November with a season-best performance in the short program. \nHe was more than 10 points ahead of second-place finisher Shoma Uno of Japan, even though he fell on his quad Salchow and triple Axel in the free skate. \n“Javier is a fighter, a person whose ideas are clear and who follows his goals to the end,” Spanish Ice Sports Federation (FEDH) general secretary Xavier Cherta told Reuters. \n“Only good things can be said about Javier.” FILE PHOTO: Javier Fernandez of Spain performs during the exhibition gala at the Rostelecom Cup ISU Grand Prix of Figure Skating in Moscow, Russia November 22, 2015.

REUTERS/Robert Pratta/File Photo \nCherta has seen Fernandez’s success spark growing public interest in figure skating. \n“When we have a high-level athlete, he has to leave Spain to train because we cannot give him the facilities for his calibre,” Cherta said. \n“But Javier’s appearance has allowed us to work toward building a high-performance center and we have the support of public institutions.” \nIn its history Spain has won only two medals at the Winter Olympics -- a gold in the men’s slalom in 1972 and a bronze in the women’s slalom in 1992 won by siblings Francisco and Blanca Fernandez Ochoa. \nGerman-born cross-country skier Johann Muehlegg won three gold medals for Spain in the 2002 Salt Lake City Games only to be disqualified for doping. \nFernandez, who left Spain at 17 to pursue his figure skating career, also recognizes his role in transforming the landscape of Spanish sport. \n“We got more support, more sponsors, more everything,” Fernandez told the ISU. \n“Now people know about figure skating a little bit more. They know that we have a team that is competing.” Reporting by Gabrielle Tétrault-Farber; Editing by John O'Brien", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-04T15:10:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-04T15:29:18.009+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
