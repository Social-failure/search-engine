It will be a permanent menu item. \nThe introduction of a light espresso is an interesting move for Starbucks, which was founded more than 40 years ago to bring darker, more flavorful coffees to the American market. The company’s vice president of Global Coffee, Andrew Linnemann, recognised this. “We set the standard for a dark, boldly roasted coffee and in this case, we broke a few of our own rules by taking a lighter approach to espresso which created a bright taste with sweet citrus notes and a smooth body,” he said. This is the first time the company has expanded its espresso offer in the U.S. For the first time in 43 years… a second espresso. Subtly sweet, amazingly smooth.
