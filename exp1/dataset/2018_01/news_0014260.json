Paulo paper. \nA press representative for Caixa confirmed the comments attributed to Occhi. \nCaixa is the biggest mortgage lender in Brazil and the main driver of the low-income housing segment, where homebuilders such as MRV Engenharia e Participações SA and Construtora Tenda SA focus their activity. \nAs Caixa is the manager of the FGTS funds, a capitalization of the bank using that money could represent a conflict of interest, prosecutors have argued before the TCU. \nFailure to strengthen its capital structure, on the other hand, could reduce Caixa’s ability to finance infrastructure projects, Occhi told the paper. \nBrazilian workers are legally required to deposit a share of their wages into the FGTS, which pays a fixed monthly rate. Surpluses are typically invested in infrastructure projects. $1 = 3.23 reais Reporting by Ana Mano; Editing by Bernadette Baum", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-11T15:07:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-11T15:25:09.010+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
