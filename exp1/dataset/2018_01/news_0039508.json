A year ago it was jeers after a second-round meltdown. \n”Playing against Nick is always tricky,“ Dimitrov told former champion Jim Courier on court. ”He was serving unbelievable. Playing unbelievable. Competing. \n“He deserves a lot of credit. He fought really hard and it’s one of the matches you have to be locked in.” \nThe prime-time clash crackled with intensity from the get-go with Dimitrov’s elegant style contrasting with the explosive shot-making of maverick 17th seed Kyrgios. \n“Oh Nicky you’re so fine, you’re so fine you blow my mind” was one of the chants sung by the gold and green clad fans there to support a player fast winning over his critics. \nEven the seagulls on the roof of the arena appeared transfixed on the drama unfolding below. \nWhile Kyrgios’s histrionics are well chronicled, all the talk this past week has been the fact that he appears ready to fulfil his vast potential, especially after a superb victory over his idol Jo-Wilfried Tsonga in round three. HIGH-OCTANE TENNIS \nDimitrov, who won the ATP Finals last year, had to play high-octane tennis to take a high-quality opener in a tiebreak. \nKyrgios’s only lapse arrived at 3-3 in the second set when he bunted a backhand long to hand Dimitrov a break point and then casually messed up a volley. \nFor a few minutes it seemed Kyrgios might unravel but his growing maturity was evident as he re-grouped and seized on a tight service game by Dimitrov at 5-4, saving a set point, before breaking back to huge roars from the crowd. \nDimitrov is made of stern stuff these days though and edged another tiebreak. He constructed a beautiful point, finishing a long rally with a stealthy volley, to move 3-1 ahead. \nKyrgios belted away a backhand and then whipped away a forehand to drag it back to 4-4 but Dimitrov replied with a punishing forehand down the line to move 5-4 ahead before a couple of Kyrgios errors gave the Bulgarian a two-set lead. \nDespite the deficit, Kyrgios’s body language bristled with intent and he took the third set after breaking at 2-2. \nThe comeback looked on as Kyrgios cranked up his serving power, belting down four aces to level at 2-2 in the fourth. \nYet the 22-year-old Australian’s hopes looked toast when he buried a smash into the net to hand Dimitrov a 5-3 lead. \nThe drama was not over though as Dimitrov wobbled when serving for victory. He served a double fault at 15-30 and then watched a backhand fly past him as Kyrgios broke back. \nDimitrov recovered his poise with a love hold but Kyrgios replied in kind with a 36th ace to force another tiebreak. \nOnce again it was Dimitov’s calm under pressure that was key as he put together another clinical tiebreaker to take victory.
