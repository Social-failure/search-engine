It would also make it easier for the council to work with other overseas regulators.\n“The bill will enhance the existing regulatory regime for auditors of listed entities ... thereby providing better protection to investors,” James Lau, secretary for financial services and the treasury, said in the statement.\n“This is crucial to strengthening Hong Kong’s status as an international financial centre and capital market.” (Reporting by Sumeet Chatterjee; Editing by Himani Sarkar)\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-01-19T14:10:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-20T17:30:14.012+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
