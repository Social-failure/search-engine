It also cut battery replacement costs and said it would change its software to show users whether their phone batteries were working well. \nThe Shanghai Consumer Council, a non-government organization approved by the Chinese authorities, said it had received 2,615 complaints about Apple products and services in 2017, compared with 964 complaints in 2015.
