Slideshow (2 Images) \nAn escalation to 24-hour strikes is the union’s last warning shot before it ballots for extended industrial action that could be crippling to companies reliant on a well-oiled supply chain of car parts and other components. \nAcross Germany, around 260 companies are expected to be affected by walkouts this week. \nWorkers at automotive supplier ZF Friedrichshafen [ZFF.UL] in the southwestern state of Baden-Wuerttemberg will go on strike from 5 am local time (0400 GMT) on Wednesday, while staff at Mercedes-Benz maker Daimler and sportscar firm Porsche will walk out on Friday, IG Metall said. \n“The employers haven’t sufficiently budged in negotiations, now we are going to push them into action with full-day warning strikes,” said Roman Zitzelsberger, head of IG Metall in Baden-Wuerttemberg, where 16 hours of negotiations failed to yield a deal. \nTo the north, workers at Kion’s ( KGX.DE ) Still brand of forklift trucks in Hamburg and at valve maker Gestra in Bremen will down their tools. \nBoth the union and the employers have left the door open to resuming talks after the planned strikes end on Friday but each said they demanded more willingness to make concessions.
