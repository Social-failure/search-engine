The one-time increase will result from Berkshire lowering its tax liability on appreciated investments. \nDue to the tax cut, Berkshire’s operating earnings power — the money it makes at its dozens of subsidiaries like Geico and BNSF Railway — could rise by 12 percent on an ongoing basis, the Barclays analysts wrote. Last week, Morgan Stanley analysts put the increase at about 14 percent. \nBerkshire has long been seen as a major beneficiary of a lower U.S. corporate tax rate, helping to drive the company’s Class A shares up 22 percent last year. They closed above $300,000 for the first time on Jan. 4. \nThe company is expected to report earnings at the end of next month.
