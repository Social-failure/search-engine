Johnson & Johnson did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Teva declined to comment.\nOpioids were involved in over 42,000 overdose deaths in 2016, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. In October, U.S. President Donald Trump declared the problem a national public health emergency.\nThe outreach to DeWine by Polster followed a hearing on Tuesday where the judge told lawyers for the plaintiffs and the companies that his goal was to “do something meaningful to abate this crisis and to do it in 2018.”\n“I don’t think anyone in the country is interested in a whole lot of finger-pointing at this point, and I‘m not either,” he said.\nDefendants in the many opioid cases include Purdue Pharma LP, Endo International PLC, Allergan PLC, AmerisourceBergen Corp, Cardinal Health Inc and McKesson Corp.\nThe lawsuits accuse drugmakers of pushing addictive painkillers through deceptive marketing and wholesale distributors of failing to monitor and report suspicious drug orders.
