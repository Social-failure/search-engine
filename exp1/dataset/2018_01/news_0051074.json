Memorial Coliseum has been long overdue. It’s needed, it’s needed badly, and we are doing it now,” USC President C.L. Max Nikias said in an interview, ahead of the deal’s public announcement. “And it will be something, after the renovations are completed…that all Angelinos should be very proud of.” \nThe Coliseum will become the only venue in the world to have hosted three Olympics; Los Angeles hosted the Summer Olympics there in 1932 and 1984. \nThe venue is home to the USC Trojans football team and, through next year, the Los Angeles Rams NFL team.
