REUTERS/Daniel Becerril \nMeade told supporters “the fight against corruption cannot wait,” and urged his rivals to support his initiative. \nA former finance minister, Meade faces a delicate balancing act of persuading undecided voters he will cut out graft without alienating the PRI base he needs to win. \nMeade’s nomination for the PRI ticket is not guaranteed, and rumours of discontent over his campaign have swirled in recent weeks, encouraging some speculation he may be ditched before the PRI formally elects its candidate on Feb. 18. \nPresidential front-runner Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, a leftist, has long railed against corruption. An opinion poll this week showed Meade losing ground to Lopez Obrador. \nMeade delivered his remarks in the state of Quintana Roo, which was governed until 2016 by the PRI’s Roberto Borge. Earlier this month, Borge was extradited from Panama to Mexico to face corruption charges. Borge denies the charges.
