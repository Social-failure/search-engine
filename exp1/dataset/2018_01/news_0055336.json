Statements that are not historical fact are forward-looking statements. Certain of these forward-looking statements can be identified by the use of words such as \"believes,\" \"anticipates,\" \"expects,\" \"intends,\" \"plans,\" \"projects,\" \"estimates,\" \"assumes,\" \"may,\" \"should,\" \"could,\" \"would,\" \"shall,\" \"will,\" \"seeks,\" \"targets,\" \"future,\" or other similar expressions. Such forward-looking statements involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other important factors, and our actual results, performance or achievements could differ materially from results, performance or achievements expressed in these forward-looking statements. Such statements include, but are not limited to, statements relating to the effective date and conditions under the Prepackaged Plan.\nThese forward-looking statements are based on the Company's current beliefs, intentions and expectations and are not guarantees or indicative of future performance, nor should any conclusions be drawn or assumptions be made as to any potential outcome of any proposed transactions the Company considers. Risks and uncertainties relating to the restructuring include: the Court's rulings in the\nChapter 11 case and the outcome of the Chapter 11 case in general; the length of time the Company will operate under Chapter 11; risks associated with third-party motions in the Chapter 11 case, which may interfere with the Company's ability to develop and consummate the Prepackaged Plan or other plan of reorganization; the ability to satisfy all conditions precedent to the Prepackaged Plan; the ability of the Company to successfully execute the Prepackaged Plan without substantial disruption to the business of, or a Chapter 11 bankruptcy filing by, one or more of its primary operating or other subsidiaries; the effects of disruption from the restructuring making it more difficult to maintain business, financing and operational relationships, to retain key executives and to maintain various licenses and approvals necessary for the Company to conduct its business; increased legal and advisor costs related to the Chapter 11 cases and other litigation and the inherent risks involved in a bankruptcy process; the ability of the Company to comply with the terms of the restructuring support agreements, including completing various stages of the restructuring within the dates specified by the restructuring support agreements; the ability of the Company to maintain the listing of its common stock on the New York Stock Exchange; and the ability of the Company to continue as a going concern. Important assumptions and other important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, those factors, risks and uncertainties described in more detail under the heading \"Risk Factors\" and elsewhere in the Company's annual and quarterly reports, including amendments thereto, and other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.\nThe above factors, risks and uncertainties are difficult to predict, contain uncertainties that may materially affect actual results and may be beyond the Company's control. New factors, risks and uncertainties emerge from time to time, and it is not possible for management to predict all such factors, risks and uncertainties. Although the Company believes that the assumptions underlying the forward-looking statements contained herein are reasonable, any of the assumptions could be inaccurate, and therefore any of these statements may prove to be inaccurate. In light of the significant uncertainties inherent in the forward-looking statements included herein, the inclusion of such information should not be regarded as a representation by the Company or any other person that the results or conditions described in such statements or the Company's objectives and plans will be achieved. These forward-looking statements speak only as of the date such statements were made or any earlier date indicated, and the Company does not undertake any obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events, changes in underlying assumptions or otherwise. If the Company were in any particular instance to update or correct a forward-looking statement, investors and others should not conclude that the Company would make additional updates or corrections thereafter.\nView original content: http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/walter-investment-management-corp-announces-update-on-anticipated-date-of-emergence-from-chapter-11-proceedings-300591005.html\nSOURCE Walter Investment Management Corp.", "external_links": ["http://www.walterinvestment.com/", "http://cases.primeclerk.com/Walter", "http://www.walterinvestment.com/restructuring.html", "http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/walter-investment-management-corp-announces-update-on-anticipated-date-of-emergence-from-chapter-11-proceedings-300591005.html"], "published": "2018-01-31T14:03:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-31T18:59:36.006+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
