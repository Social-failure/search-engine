At least 10,000 people have been killed.\nWAM said local Yemeni fighters, backed by UAE troops, raided Houthi strongholds between al-Khoukha and the town of Heys, about 25 km (15 miles) to the east to try to secure Red Sea areas captured last month.\n“Emirati armed forces members and Yemeni resistance fighters managed to cut supply lines for the Houthi coup militias between Hodeidah and Taiz south of Heys city,” WAM said, citing an Emirati army source.\nIt said that dozens of Houthi fighters were killed.\nResidents said that Houthi forces, who control most of Taiz province and surround pro-government forces inside the provincial capital, continue to receive supplies through the adjacent Ibb province.\nA spokesman for the Houthi-controlled Yemeni army could not be reached for a comment and the group’s media outlets made no mention of any fighting in the area.\nReporting by Omar Fahmy; Writing by Sami Aboudi; Editing by Robin Pomeroy\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-03T23:28:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-04T00:13:33.011+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
