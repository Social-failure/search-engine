For now, I just need to stay on top of it and have to stay fit,” the Northern Irishman told the newspaper. \nThe response to the story prompted McIlroy to use his Instagram account to clarify that he was not unduly concerned. \n“It’s really not that big a deal and nothing to worry about, apart from getting an annual check up, like you should do anyway,” he wrote. \n“I feel there’s been a big reaction to it in the media which there really shouldn’t be. I‘m fit and healthy and can’t wait to get my 2018 season started in Abu Dhabi next week.” \nHe was referring to the European Tour’s Abu Dhabi Championship, where he will begin a busy schedule in the build up to April’s U.S. Masters, the only major he needs to win to complete the career grand slam.
