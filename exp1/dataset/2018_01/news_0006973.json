Jerry Brown joined governors of Oregon and Washington in vowing to do \"whatever it takes\" to stop that from happening off the West Coast.\nState officials, environmental groups and oil-industry analysts say California has solid regulatory and legal means to try to make good on that threat.\nFor one thing, oil companies know that even if the federal government sells leases in federal waters, California and other coastal states by law control the three miles (five kilometers) nearest to shore, all along the coasts.\nThat means California decides on permits for any oil pipelines that would connect oil platforms to land, along with any transport centers, refineries or holding stations once the crude makes it ashore.\n\"Operators don't tend to operate (off) states that don't want production,\" said Kevin Book, an analyst with ClearView Energy Partners in Washington, D.C.\nThere are ways around California's three-mile (five-kilometer) lock on shore — such as using ships to transport oil from platforms in federal waters instead of pipelines, he said.\nBut considering all the potential financial, regulatory and legal problems oil companies would face in drilling off California, oil prices would have to go far higher to make that enticing, Book said.\n\"At today's crude oil prices, the way companies look at political risk ... when you do the math on paper it doesn't add up,\" Book said.\nBrown joined both U.S. senators and other state officials last year in appealing unsuccessfully to Obama to ban California offshore drilling before he left office, and polls show most Californians opposed to offshore drilling.\nCalifornians vividly remember the 1969 oil spill and a 2015 Southern California spill from a pipeline serving a platform in federal waters that blackened more than 100 miles (160 kilometers) of public beaches and closed two state parks.\n\"You walk on the beach and see oil in the sand and the water and washing up, and there's dead birds and dead fish,\" said Kristen Hislop, with the Environmental Defense Center, a Santa Barbara environmental group formed in response to the 1969 oil spill. \"You very much remember why we fight so hard to protect our coastline.\"\nIn California, \"we do have plenty of opportunity to fight these new oil developments and we will pursue all those avenues,\" said Linda Krop, legal counsel for the same group.\nFor example, a 1972 federal coastal act gives California extensive input on federal actions along the coast, including the granting of federal oil leases.\n\"Nothing galvanizes bipartisan resistance in California like the threat of more offshore drilling,\" said Dayna Bochco, chairwoman of the California Coastal Commission, which would have the authority to oppose offshore leases under that act. \"We've fought similar efforts before, and we will fight them again.\"\nRobert Jablon in Los Angeles contributed to this report.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-05T01:01:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-05T06:34:05.011+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
