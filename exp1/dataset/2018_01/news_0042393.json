Gentiloni said the election was a key moment for the country.\n\"We are exactly on the right track because the economy is back in growth — just one year ago the IMF (International Monetary Fund) had a forecast for 2017 of 0.7 percent growth in Italy but now it has been revised by the IMF to 1.6 percent growth for 2017 — but as we all know the fact that we have positive (growth) numbers doesn't mean automatically that we've solved our social and political problems.\"\n\"So we have to be very careful with this election not to disrupt the reforms that we've realized in the last five years with the effort of Italian workers and enterprises. To disrupt this would be very serious,\" he said.\nAccording to the latest poll by Tecne released on January 22, the anti-establishment, Euroskeptic Five Star Movement (M5S) under Luigi Di Maio is leading voter polls, with 27 percent of the vote.\nSecond is the Democratic Party, fronted by party secretary the former Prime Minister Matteo Renzi, is seen with 22.3 percent of the vote.\nshow chapters Italian prime minister: Center-left will be pillar of any coalition      9 Hours Ago | 03:56 In third place as a sole party is the center-right Forza Italia led by former Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi, with 18.2 percent of the vote, followed by Lega (Nord), a right-wing pro-Northern Italy party with 12.6 percent of the vote. The two parties could form a coalition government with the help of the smaller Fratelli d'Italia party, which is also Euroskeptic.\nGentiloni had little expectations that such an alliance would survive, saying that the center-right coalition was one of \"very different positions.\"\n\"One is a conservative party (Forza Italia) and the other one and two are populist, anti-EU parties (Lega Nord and Fratelli D'Italia). I think that this coalition won't stay in place,\" he said.\nPrime Minister Paolo Gentiloni, who was given the role after Matteo Renzi resigned following a failed referendum on constitutional reform, is not running for re-election although he is popular with the business community.\n\"I am in good health but my commitment was, 13 months ago, to try to bring the country to the end of our legislature, addressing reforms and a couple of very serious crises on migration and the banking system. This was my commitment and the commitment ends with the election, after the election we will see,\" he said.\nGovernment has been 'very effective' Meanwhile, Mario Greco, the chief executive of Zurich Insurance, told CNBC Wednesday that the Gentiloni government had been \"very effective.\"\nshow chapters Italy PM Gentiloni's government has been very effective, says Zurich Insurance CEO      12 Hours Ago | 03:08 \"I think it's (Gentiloni's government) been appreciated by the markets, it's been appreciated by investors and it's been appreciated outside of Italy,\" he said, hoping that the recovery seen in the country would continue.\n\"Italy has to continue. Italy has been improving, it has been recovering, it is clearly one of the troubled issues of the European economy still today but it's getting much better and it's heading in the very right direction and so it has to continue.\"\nFellow Italian Chief Executive, Claudio Descalzi from Italian energy firm Eni, told CNBC that Italy needed strong and stable government.\n\"Without expressing any political view because it's not my role, what we really need after the election is a strong government that gives continuity and continues reforms that were started under the previous government (of Matteo Renzi),\" Eni's Claudio Descalzi told CNBC at the World Economic Forum in Davos , Switzerland. \n\"We have to make Italy attractive from an investment point of view. Italy's doing very well, we've increased the gross domestic product (GDP), the average was 1.6 percent/1.7 percent and we have record exports of more than 500 billion euros last year so ...
