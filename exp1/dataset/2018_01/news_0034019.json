He also reiterated that East Jerusalem should be the capital of a future Palestinian state. \n“We hope that the U.S. will reach out and find the right way to move forward in these challenging circumstances,” the king said. \nAt the end of the visit, Pence in remarks to the press said he “agreed to disagree” with King Abdullah on the impact of Trump’s move. \nPence said in Egypt on Saturday and again in Jordan that the United States would support a two-state solution for Israelis and Palestinians if they both agreed to it. \nTrump’s endorsement in December of Israel’s claim to Jerusalem as its capital drew universal condemnation from Arab leaders and criticism around the world. It also broke with decades of U.S. policy that the city’s status must be decided in negotiations between Israel and the Palestinians. \nJordan lost East Jerusalem and the West Bank to Israel during the Arab-Israeli war in 1967. \nPence told the king that Washington was committed to preserving the status quo of holy sites in Jerusalem. \nKing Abdullah’s Hashemite dynasty is the custodian of the Muslim holy sites in the city, making Amman particularly sensitive to any changes of status there. \n“For us, Jerusalem is key to Muslims and Christians, as it is to Jews. It is key to peace in the region and key to enabling Muslims to effectively fight some of our root causes of radicalization,” he said. \nJordanian officials fear Trump’s move has wrecked chances of a resumption of Arab-Israeli peace talks, which King Abdullah had sought to revive.
