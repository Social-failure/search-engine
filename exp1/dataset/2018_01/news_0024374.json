Flows into its blended debt, alternatives and multi-asset investments were flat. \nPerformance across its fixed income and equities products was positive but flat in its alternatives and liquidity products, it said. \nShares in Ashmore rose 2.7 percent to 439.4 pence each in early deals, among top gainers on the FTSE mid-cap index .FTMC . \nKBW analyst Jonathan Richards said the rise in assets beat his forecast by 3 percent, but given the strong recent performance of Ashmore’s shares he rated them “market perform”. \n“In order to justify this valuation, organic growth would need to remain at these elevated levels for some time,” he wrote in a note to clients. \nEmerging markets assets have risen strongly in the last two years after several years of underperformance relative to developed markets, helping lure back investors. \nCompetitive currencies in many emerging market economies were helping drive exports and boost growth, Chief Executive Mark Coombs said, adding he expected more of the same in 2018. \n“The next phase of the cycle should see institutional flows stimulating domestic demand and so provide for continued attractive returns, particularly from local currency-denominated assets including equities,” he said.
