It was fined $1.92 billion in that case. \nIn October, a federal jury in Brooklyn convicted Mark Johnson, the former head of HSBC’s global foreign exchange cash trading desk, of trading ahead of a $3.5 billion currency transaction by his client Cairn Energy Plc ( CNE.L ). \nJohnson has yet to be sentenced. Stuart Scott, HSBC’s former head of cash trading for Europe, the Middle East and Africa, was also charged in that case and has fought extradition. \nHSBC agreed to pay Cairn $8.08 million under a settlement reached in July, which the Justice Department said it credited as “full restitution” to that company. \nIn a statement on Thursday, HSBC said the $63.1 million fine reflected a 15 percent reduction that took into account the bank’s cooperation and “extensive remediation” efforts. \nThe case is U.S. v. HSBC Holdings Plc, U.S. District Court, Eastern District of New York, No. 18-cr-00030.
