The group bought the asset in 2011 for around A$117 million, said the other person.\nThe sources did not want to be named as they were not authorized to speak to media.\nBlackstone declined to comment. HNA did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\nBloomberg first reported about the sale.\nHNA, a aviation-to-financial services conglomerate, has come under a lot of scrutiny and due-diligence checks from banks and regulators following its July announcement that it changed its shareholding structure, while indicating that two previously named shareholders were in fact proxies for company founders.\nSeveral regulators have subsequently blocked or questioned its overseas deals. HNA has also recently struggled for cash, asking some lenders to extend loans and delaying payments to lessors in several cases.\n$1 = 1.2424 Australian dollars Reporting by Kane Wu; Editing by Himani Sarkar\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-26T07:55:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-26T08:11:18.012+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
