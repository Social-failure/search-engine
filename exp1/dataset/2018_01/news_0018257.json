But I don't think they're going to get hit.\" \nFor others, owning a home might not be the incentive that it used to be in those states, leading to more sellers and lower prices. \nThe National Association of Realtors is forecasting home prices to be down 10 percent for California, Randow pointed out. \nFirst time homebuyers might also be hesitant due to higher prices, he added. \nBut on the other side, Evercore ISI analyst Stephen Kim told CNBC last week , \"This is sort of a backdoor way of removing a subsidy for housing that we've seen in this country for almost a century.\" \nMany experts blame that \"subsidy\" and the lax mortgage lending standards of the past as factors that fueled the housing price bubble that peaked in 2006 and then burst.
