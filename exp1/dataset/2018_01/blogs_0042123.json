Used copies of his investing book \"Margin of Safety\" still sell for nearly $700 online. \nBaupost did not immediately respond to a request for comment. \nThe firm generated midsingle-digit return in 2017, according to the investor letter. Baupost had $30 billion of assets under management as of March. \n— CNBC's Michael Bloom contributed to this story.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-25T19:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-25T19:05:27.042+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
