They'd rather not deal with a currency that's not a currency.\" \nBitcoin was falling for a second day on Wednesday, breaking below $10,000 for the first time since November. Ethereum and ripple, the second- and third-biggest digital assets, respectively, continued to move lower as well. \n\"I'm not saying they think it's going to die,\" said Cramer, host of \" Mad Money .\" \"I'm just saying that they think, 'Why the heck do we need this?'\" \nLater on the call, Moynihan reiterated his worries that cryptocurrencies make it difficult to track fund flows by criminals. \nMeanwhile, BofA reported better-than-expected adjusted fourth-quarter earnings earlier Wednesday, but revenue fell slightly short of expectations. Despite not helping customers invest in bitcoin, the bank has applied for patents in blockchain technology. \nâ€” CNBC's Evelyn Cheng contributed to this report.
