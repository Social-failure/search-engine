In a tweet, the Smithsonian said it would update its status beyond Monday “as soon as we know.”\nBut in Philadelphia, visitors were turned away at the Liberty Bell, while tourists in New York on Saturday expressed disappointment that they were unable to take the ferry to the island that houses the Statue of Liberty.\nDuring the last shutdown in 2013, a number of governors used state funds to keep certain parks open, including the Statue of Liberty, which at that time cost $61,600 per day to reopen.\nSpeaking to reporters on Saturday, Cuomo called it a “gross injustice” to close down the statue, a symbol of American freedoms. The Democratic governor said he would use state money to pay for operations, both because it is an emblem of New York and the United States and because the cost is justified from a tourism standpoint.\n“We’re going to be talking to the federal government as soon as somebody answers the phone,” he said.\nIn Arizona, Republican Governor Doug Ducey vowed last week to keep the Grand Canyon operating using state funds in the event of a shutdown.\nBut in South Dakota, home of Mount Rushmore, Republican Governor Dennis Daugaard on Friday said he would not take any action to keep the monument open during a shutdown.\nReporting by Joseph Ax; Editing by Frank McGurty and Jeffrey Benkoe\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-21T18:12:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-21T18:33:18.005+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
