(Nasdaq:WASH), parent company of The Washington Trust Company, today announced fourth quarter 2017 net income of $8.0 million, or $0.46 per diluted share, compared to net income of $13.0 million, or $0.75 per diluted share, reported for the third quarter of 2017. Net income for the year ended December 31, 2017 totaled $45.9 million, or $2.64 per diluted share, compared to $46.5 million, or $2.70 per diluted share, reported for the prior year.\nOn December 22, 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (\"the Tax Act\") was signed into law, permanently lowering the corporate federal income tax rate from 35% to 21%, effective January 1, 2018. The enactment of the Tax Act in 2017 required companies to revalue and reassess deferred tax assets and liabilities reflecting the new federal income tax rate. As a result, in the fourth quarter of 2017, Washington Trust's net deferred tax assets were written down by a non-cash charge of $6.2 million, with a corresponding increase to income tax expense. This write-down adjustment reduced fourth quarter and full-year 2017 earnings per diluted share by $0.36.\n“Our fourth quarter earnings, excluding the non-cash charge associated with the enactment of the Tax Act, were very solid. We are pleased to report record levels of total loans, total deposits, and wealth management assets under administration,” stated Joseph J. MarcAurele, Washington Trust Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. “Washington Trust’s strong financial foundation, diversified revenue stream, and market footprint positions us for future growth and success in the year ahead.”\nSelected highlights for fourth quarter and full-year 2017 include:\nFull-year 2017 net interest income increased by 8% over the prior year and amounted to $120 million, a record level for Washington Trust.\nTotal loans were $3.4 billion at December 31, 2017, up by 2% in the fourth quarter and up by 4% from a year ago.\nDeposits totaled $3.2 billion at December 31, 2017, up by 3% in the fourth quarter and up by 6% from a year ago.\nWealth management assets grew to a record $6.7 billion at December 31, 2017. Full-year 2017 wealth management revenues amounted to an all-time high of $39.3 million, up by 5% from the prior year.\nNet Interest Income\nNet interest income totaled $30.9 million for the fourth quarter of 2017, up by $830 thousand, or 3%, from the third quarter. The net interest margin was 2.95% for the fourth quarter, up by 2 basis points from the preceding quarter. Significant linked quarter changes included:\nAverage interest-earning assets were up by $79 million, reflecting growth in average loan balances. The yield on interest-earning assets for the fourth quarter was 3.70%, up by 3 basis points from the preceding quarter.\nAverage interest-bearing liabilities increased by $54 million, with growth in average in-market deposits, partially offset by declines in average wholesale funding balances (Federal Home Loan Bank advances and wholesale brokered time deposits). The cost of interest-bearing funds was 0.93%, up by 1 basis point from the preceding quarter.\nNoninterest Income\nNoninterest income amounted to $16.2 million for the fourth quarter of 2017, down by $1.1 million, or 6%, from the third quarter. Significant linked quarter changes included:\nWealth management revenues totaled $9.9 million in the fourth quarter of 2017, compared to $10.0 million in the preceding quarter. Full-year 2017 wealth management revenues amounted to $39.3 million, up by $1.8 million, or 5%, from the prior year, due to growth in asset-based revenues.\nWealth management assets under administration totaled $6.7 billion at December 31, 2017, up by $127 million, or 2%, from the balance at September 30, 2017. Wealth management assets were up by $651 million, or 11%, from the balance at the end of 2016, reflecting financial market appreciation. Managed assets represented 93% of total wealth management assets at December 31, 2017.\nMortgage banking revenues totaled $3.1 million in the fourth quarter of 2017, up modestly from the preceding quarter. Residential mortgage loans sold to the secondary market amounted to $145 million in the fourth quarter, compared to $147 million in the preceding quarter.\nLoan related derivative income totaled $470 thousand in the fourth quarter of 2017, down by $982 thousand, or 68%, from the preceding quarter, due to a lower volume of commercial borrower loan related derivative transactions. Full-year 2017 loan related derivative income amounted to $3.2 million, essentially unchanged from the full-year amount recognized in 2016.\nNoninterest Expenses\nNoninterest expenses amounted to $25.8 million for the fourth quarter of 2017, down by $1.0 million, or 4%, from the third quarter. The linked quarter decline in noninterest expenses was primarily due to the following:\nA reduction to noninterest expenses of $333 thousand ($0.02 per diluted share) was recognized in the fourth quarter resulting from a nontaxable downward adjustment in the fair value of a contingent consideration liability that was initially recorded upon the completion of a 2015 acquisition.\nDuring the fourth quarter, Washington Trust received $325 thousand (after-tax $205 thousand, or $0.01 per diluted share) in settlement of a claim against another bank related to a previously disclosed dispute. This matter was the subject of a $570 thousand expense charge recognized in the third quarter. The settlement was recorded as a reduction to other noninterest expenses in the fourth quarter.\nExcluding the aforementioned items from the third and fourth quarters, noninterest expenses were up by $228 thousand, or 1%, on a linked quarter basis, primarily due to an increase in foreclosed property costs in the fourth quarter.\nIncome tax expense totaled $13.2 million for the fourth quarter of 2017, reflecting an effective tax rate of 62.3%. As previously mentioned, income tax expense included the $6.2 million write-down associated with the revaluation of the Corporation's net deferred tax assets due to the Tax Act. The revaluation of our net deferred tax assets is subject to further guidance and interpretation of the Tax Act that may be issued. Excluding the non-cash write-down adjustment, the effective tax rate for the fourth quarter of 2017 would have been 33.1%, compared to 32.8% for the preceding quarter. Based on current federal and applicable state income tax statutes, the Corporation currently expects its 2018 effective tax rate to be approximately 21.5%.\nLoans\nTotal loans amounted to $3.4 billion at December 31, 2017, up by $51 million, or 2%, from the end of the preceding quarter. Residential loan portfolio balances increased by $32 million, or 3%, from the balance at September 30, 2017. In late December 2017, $19 million of residential mortgage loans were purchased with a weighted average rate of 3.24%. These purchased loans were individually evaluated to our underwriting standards and are predominantly secured by properties in Massachusetts. The commercial loan portfolio increased by $23 million, or 1%, from the end of the preceding quarter, with growth in commercial and industrial loans and in commercial construction and development loans, partially offset by a decrease in commercial mortgage loans. The consumer loan portfolio was down by $3 million, or 1%, from the end of the third quarter.\nFor full-year 2017, total loans rose by $140 million, or 4%, including a 9% increase in the residential loan portfolio and a 3% increase in the commercial loan portfolio.\nInvestment Securities\nThe investment securities portfolio totaled $793 million at December 31, 2017, up by $66 million, or 9%, from the balance at September 30, 2017. During the quarter, government agency mortgage-backed debt securities and agency debt securities totaling $94 million and with a weighted average yield of 2.68% were purchased. The purchases were partially offset by routine principal pay-downs on mortgage-backed securities and a maturity of a municipal bond. Investment securities represented 18% of total assets at December 31, 2017.\nDeposits and Borrowings\nTotal deposits amounted to $3.2 billion at December 31, 2017, up by $86 million, or 3%, from the end of the preceding quarter. Included in total deposits were wholesale brokered time deposit balances of $398 million, which decreased by $18 million from the balance at September 30, 2017. Excluding wholesale brokered time deposits, in-market deposits increased by $104 million, or 4%, from the end of the preceding quarter, with growth across all deposit categories.\nTotal deposits were up by $179 million, or 6%, from the balance at the end of 2016. Excluding balances of wholesale brokered time deposits, total in-market deposits were up by $193 million, or 7%, in 2017. The balances of demand deposits and NOW accounts grew by $114 million, or 11%, in 2017.\nFederal Home Loan Bank advances stood at $791 million at December 31, 2017, down by $23 million, or 3%, from the balance at September 30, 2017 and down by $58 million, or 7%, from a year ago.\nAsset Quality\nPast due loans amounted to $20.1 million, or 0.59% of total loans, at December 31, 2017, compared to $16.4 million, or 0.49% of total loans, at September 30, 2017. The increase in past due loans was primarily due to one well-secured commercial and industrial loan becoming delinquent in the latter portion of the quarter. Total nonaccrual loans amounted to $15.2 million, or 0.45% of total loans, at December 31, 2017, down from $18.5 million, or 0.56% of total loans, at September 30, 2017.\nA loan loss provision of $200 thousand was charged to earnings in the fourth quarter of 2017, compared to a loan loss provision of $1.3 million in the preceding quarter. These provisions were based on management's assessment of loss exposure, as well as loan loss allocations commensurate with changes in the loan portfolio. Net charge-offs totaled $1.0 million in the fourth quarter of 2017, compared to $654 thousand in the preceding quarter. The charge-offs recognized in the fourth quarter were largely attributable to two nonaccrual commercial mortgage relationships. The allowance for loan losses was $26.5 million, or 0.79% of total loans, at December 31, 2017, compared to $27.3 million, or 0.82% of total loans, at September 30, 2017.\nCapital and Dividends\nTotal shareholders' equity was $413 million at December 31, 2017, compared to $414 million at September 30, 2017. Book value per share amounted to $23.99 at December 31, 2017, compared to $24.06 at September 30, 2017. The decline in shareholders' equity and book value per share reflects the impact of the $6.2 million net deferred tax asset write-down adjustment recognized in earnings due to the enactment of the Tax Act in December 2017.\nCapital levels at December 31, 2017 exceeded the regulatory minimum levels to be considered well capitalized, with a total risk-based capital ratio of 12.45% at December 31, 2017, compared to 12.53% at September 30, 2017. The reduction in the total risk-based capital ratio in the fourth quarter reflects a charge of $1.9 million related to the net deferred tax asset write-down adjustment, as determined in accordance with the regulatory guidance issued on January 18, 2018.\nThe Board of Directors declared a quarterly dividend of 39 cents per share December 31, 2017. The dividend was paid on January 12, 2018 to shareholders of record on January 2, 2018.\nConference Call\nWashington Trust will host a conference call to discuss its fourth quarter results, business highlights and outlook on Wednesday, January 31, 2018 at 8:30 a.m. (Eastern Time).
