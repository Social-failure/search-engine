The narrative of yield rotation has already begun; the playbook for the time being will be a relatively simple one: sell yield,” analyst Craig Moffett wrote in a note to clients Tuesday. “Even equity income managers are likely to rotate – in their case from dividend yield to dividend growth.” \nMoffett increased his price target for Verizon shares to $56 from $51, representing 8 percent upside to Friday’s close. \nThe analyst said telecommunication stocks such as Verizon trade like “bond surrogates.” He noted dividend yields for Verizon and AT&T have correlated with ten-year treasury yields. Moffett also said Verizon will not be able to maintain a dividend yield under 4 percent or an elevated stock price because the company lacks sales growth. \n“While wireless pricing appears to be firm, the emergence of Comcast, and soon Charter, as new competitors appears poised to starve the incumbents of unit growth,” he wrote. “The risks of a re-escalation of competitive intensity as the market struggles to find phone subscribers are real.” \nVerizon’s current dividend yield is 4.6 percent, according to FactSet. \nThe company did not immediately respond to a request for comment. \nDisclosure: Comcast owns CNBC parent NBCUniversal. \n— CNBC’s Patricia Martell contributed to this report.
