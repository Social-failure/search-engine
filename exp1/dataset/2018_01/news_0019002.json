The case took a twist in November when President Donald Trump's Justice Department reversed course and sided with Lucia, known for his \"Buckets of Money\" investment strategy.\nLucia and the administration argue that the SEC violates the U.S. Constitution in the way it hires its administrative law judges. SEC critics have said the use of these in-house judges gives the agency an unfair advantage in enforcement disputes.
