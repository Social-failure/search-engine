Ten-year yields were at 2.54 percent -- comfortably below Wednesday’s 10-month peak just shy of 2.60 percent.\nThere was also some relief from Japan, another source of pain for bond markets this week.\nThe Bank of Japan (BOJ) maintained the amount of its bond purchases on Thursday. A cut in its buying of longer-dated debt earlier this week had fanned worries the BOJ may be moving to turn off its stimulus.\nWith speculation about a turning point in central bank policy, minutes from the European Central Bank’s December released later in the day were also in focus.\n“We expect optimistic economic assessment to retain the attention but we doubt a change of tone at the ECB is imminent barring a pick-up in core inflation,” Mizuho said in a note.\nElsewhere, Italy is expected to sell up to 6 billion euros of new debt.\nReporting by Dhara Ranasinghe; graphic by Richard Leong; Editing by Catherine Evans\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.", "external_links": ["http://tmsnrt.rs/2ii2Bqr", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-01-11T16:15:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-12T18:38:07.002+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
