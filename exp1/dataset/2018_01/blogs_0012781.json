Some of those targeted may include firms and individuals whose sanctions were scrapped in the landmark 2015 nuclear accord.\nTrump must decide by Friday to extend the sanctions relief. Otherwise, it could jeopardize the nuclear agreement.\nThe six people spoke on condition of anonymity because they weren't authorized to talk publicly. They cautioned that Trump could still reject the recommendation of his top security aides.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-10T20:15:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-10T20:27:46.008+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
