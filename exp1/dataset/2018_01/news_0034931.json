We may be lucky to hit 1.8-2 million tonnes of maize,” Kaleyi said. \nThe maize production rose to 3.61 million tonnes in the 2016/2017 season from 2.87 million tonnes the previous season. \nZambia’s maize production season runs from October-November when the planting is done to March-April when the crop is ready for harvesting. \nBut this season a dry spell has hit small-scale farmers who rely on rain-fed irrigation and produce 82 percent of Zambia’s maize, Kaleyi said. \n“The crop is wilting and this is very bad because it has hit the maize belt,” he said. \nThe situation will be made worse due to late access by small-scale farmers to fertilizer from the government, he said.
