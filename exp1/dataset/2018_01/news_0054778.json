FOREIGN POLICY \nHe also criticised the lack of substantial foreign policy initiatives in a blueprint agreed by Chancellor Angela Merkel’s conservatives and the centre-left Social Democrats in their bid to renew the coalition that has ruled Germany since 2013.“They’re losing themselves in the fine print,” he said, urging Germany to play a more decisive role in shaping the future of Europe, including by pushing for more areas where the EU decides by majority instead of by unanimous consent. \n“Without majority decisions, Europe will always allow itself to be divided,” Ischinger said, citing divisions on issues such as the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline between Russia and Germany. \nThe coalition blueprint does not mention the NATO 2-percent target given divisions between the political blocs, with Social Democrats arguing that Germany should spend more on development aid instead. \nIschinger said failure to explicitly state a commitment to the NATO target would “ruin our credibility in this area”. He rejected comments in which Foreign Minister Sigmar Gabriel, a Social Democrat, argued that other European countries would fear a Germany that spent that much of its budget on the military. \n“How can it be that our rich country with over 80 million citizen doesn’t have a single helicopter we can use in Afghanistan, not a single useable submarine,” Ischinger said, referring to recent news reports confirmed by military officials. “How can it be that we send our soldiers to Afghanistan without the best armoured vests?” \nIschinger also criticised a move by the potential coalition to limit German arms exports to any parties involved in the Yemen conflict, saying such a move would complicate moves toward a joint European defence strategy. \n“What we really need are unified European arms export guidelines that apply to everyone,” he said.
