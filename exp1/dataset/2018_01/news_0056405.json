BridgeTex is expanding the pipeline system again, for a new capacity of about 440,000 bpd, expected to be operational in early 2019.\nBridgeTex completed a supplemental open season and secured additional volume commitments for the new expansion capacity from the Permian Basin to East Houston, it said in a filing with the U.S. Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC).\nThe pipeline set a volume commitment of 10,000 bpd-40,000 bpd for a term of 3 years at $2.10 per barrel and for a term of five years at $2 per barrel from Midland to East Houston.\nBridgeTex set a volume commitment of 10,000 bpd-40,000 bpd for a term of three years at $1.85 per barrel and for a term of five years at $1.75 per barrel from Colorado City to East Houston.\nThe new rates have been agreed to by at least one non-affiliated company that intends to use the new services offered in the tariff, BridgeTex said in the filing.\nBridgeTex had initially sought FERC approval for some rates after completing an open season in July but has faced protests from Occidental Energy Marketing Inc.\nBridgeTex is co-owned by Midstream Partners LP and Plains All American Pipeline LP.
