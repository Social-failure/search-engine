REUTERS/David Gray/File Photo \nAs the gender of green turtles is determined by temperature, the hotter weather caused by climate change induces warmer incubations of eggs, and that has led to a greater number of female hatchlings. \nThe study published last week revealed that more than 99 percent of the juvenile and sub adult population on the northern part of the reef are female, and 69 percent are female on the southern reef. \nThe two populations are genetically distinct. \n“We’re now seeing on those northern beaches virtually no males being born,” said WWF-Australia Chief Executive Dermot O‘Gorman. \n“That really rings alarm bells for the long-term survival of those northern green turtle population.” Turtles are seen on the beach at sunset on Ingram Island, Queensland, Australia in this handout photo dated August 28, 2014.
