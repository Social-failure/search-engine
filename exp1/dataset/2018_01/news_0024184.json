The RCMP said the assistance of Dutch national police and the United States’ Federal Bureau of Investigation was “essential to the investigation.”\nThe charges against Bloom include trafficking in identity information, mischief to data, and possession of property obtained by crime, the RCMP said.\nReporting by Alastair Sharp\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-15T19:21:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-15T19:59:32.016+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
