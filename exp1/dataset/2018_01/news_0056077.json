But the state-controlled bank wants to be able to serve clients in what is a popular market for some investors. \n“That’s why we think that we need to have a strategic access to these products,” Shemetov told reporters at a news briefing. \n“Swiss laws allow cryptocurrency trading, and we are working on infrastructure to start offering these services through our Swiss subsidiary,” he said. \nRussia’s top lender has a branch in Switzerland, Sberbank (Switzerland) AG, headquartered in Zurich. \nShemetov did not say when Sberbank could start trading cryptocurrencies.
