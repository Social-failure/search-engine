U.S. Vice President Mike Pence cast the tie-breaking vote in the Senate to secure its passage. NEXT STEPS \nRichards is the daughter of the late Ann Richards, the former Democratic Texas Governor. She said in her statement that she would be continue to be an activist, “marching right alongside” grassroots voices advocating for “basic rights and healthcare.” \nShe has been encouraging women to run during the midterm elections and has said she would be fundraising and campaigning for Democrats, including the record number of women running this election. \nHer memoir, “Make Trouble: Standing Up, Speaking Out, and Finding the Courage to Lead — My Life Story,” is due to be published in April. \nDuring her presidency, Planned Parenthood grew its financial supporters grew from 3 million people to 11 million people, even as state legislatures passed hundreds of laws that restrict access to abortion.
