As Ronaldo walked toward the dressing room his main preoccupation was with how his face looked.\nHe asked one of Madrid’s medical staff if he could use his phone and was seen using the mobile’s screen to scrutinize his face, which was left as red as the shirt of his former club Manchester United.\nReporting by Richard Martin, editing by Pritha Sarkar\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-21T20:19:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-21T20:37:35.022+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
