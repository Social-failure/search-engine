This main reason for the blockage was resolved,” he said.\nZodiac is in the midst of being taken over by France’s Safran after repeated delays and profit warnings.\nThe company broadly addressed problems of quantity in the first half of 2017 and quality during the second half, he told the AJPAE aerospace media association.\nEvrard said a backlog of about 30 undelivered A320neo-family jets, which have been parked in Toulouse and Hamburg waiting for engines, should be cleared by mid-year.
