Later that year, it was approached by Saks Fifth Avenue parent Hudson’s Bay Co. about being acquired. But the talks ended without a deal. \nBy Suzanne Kapner Joann S. Lublin \nNeiman Marcus Group Ltd., the luxury retailer saddled with debt from two subsequent leveraged buyouts, is preparing to appoint a new chief executive, according to people familiar with the situation. \nKaren Katz, a Neiman lifer who has served as CEO and president since 2010, is stepping aside and will be replaced by an outsider, the people said, declining to identify the successor. Katz, who is 60 years old, plans to retire from her executive duties, but will retain her board seat, the people said. \nThrough a spokeswoman, Katz declined to comment. \nThe company has faltered since it was acquired for $6 billion in 2013 by Ares Management LLC ARES, -0.74% and the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board, shifting ownership from one set of private-equity firms to another. Together, the transactions left Neiman saddled with about $4.8 billion in long-term debt as of Oct. 28. \nKatz joined the Dallas chain known for its high-end designer goods in 1985 and climbed the ranks. She held various roles, including president of its catalog division, which included internet operations. She successfully led the company out of the recession, returning sales and profits to prerecession levels.
