Retail sales are expected to grow by just over 10 percent. Both official and private surveys this week pointed to accelerating momentum in the services sector, which now accounts for over half of the economy.\nThe data will culminate in fourth-quarter and full-year GDP on Jan. 18.\nThe economy is expected to clock growth of 6.8 percent in 2017, up slightly from the previous year, before easing to around 6.4 percent this year.\nReuters reported on Thursday that China will keep its target for economic growth at “around 6.5 percent” in 2018 -- the same as in 2017 -- as it seeks to balance efforts to reduce risks in the financial system while keeping economic growth stable.\nReporting by Elias Glenn; polling by Shaloo Shrivastava; Editing by Kim Coghill\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-01-05T14:43:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-05T09:42:47.001+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
