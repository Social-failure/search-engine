At one stage I said to the chair umpire that the 25-second rule, there’s no need.\n”Definitely it squeezes you, because it puts you under so much pressure with the heat, then you rush. Honestly, I played two sets out of breath, for nothing, just to please the official.\n“So at the end, it’s a bit risky. I‘m telling you, I was dying on the court for 40 minutes.”\nHad the temperature reached 40 degrees and Wet Bulb Globe (humidity) reading exceeded 32.5 degrees, organizers would have stopped play on the outside courts and the roofs closed on the three main courts to provide shade.\nHowever, humidity was not a major factor.\nMonfils said he did not ask for the roof to be closed but suggested there could have been a short delay.\n“Maybe not the roof because the fittest wins, and I think that is fair enough,” he said.\nDjokovic, who was given a time warning in the fourth set, said playing conditions had been right on the limit but was reluctant to criticize umpire John Blom.\n“I got a time violation today, and didn’t say anything,” the Serbian 12-times grand slam champion told reporters.\n”The chair umpire in the next changeover was trying to justify why he gave me a time violation. He did give me the pre-warning today. I have nothing to say. I respect that.\n“It’s not easy also for him to sit out there and kind of control both players.”\nThree-times former Australian Open champion Mats Wilander, working for Eurosport as a commentator, rejected suggestions that organizers should have shut the roof.\n”No way should they have put the roof on,“ the Swede told Reuters. ”Two choices, either play or don’t play.\n”I don’t think today was (that bad). Juan Martin del Potro didn’t have a problem. I think it’s more a problem for players who don’t have options and variety in their game.\n”Someone like Monfils who doesn’t like to come forward and finish points at the net, he will suffer more. Is it unfair?\n”You watch Roger Federer in this heat and you wouldn’t be able to tell the difference.\n“Today was borderline. But players are the fittest people around, it’s more for the spectators and ball kids.”\nReporting by Martyn Herman, editing by Pritha Sarkar\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-01-18T19:10:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-19T12:11:05.013+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
