Haveles, now a partner at Pepper Hamilton, referred a reporter to his former firm.\nRennert is worth $3.8 billion according to Forbes magazine, and has denied the looting allegations. His current lawyer, Steven Kaufman, was unavailable for comment on the lawsuit, which also seeks interest.\nThe case arose from the 2001 bankruptcy of Magnesium Corp of America.\nLee Buchwald, MagCorp’s bankruptcy trustee, accused Rennert of diverting money from the now-defunct company to help build his 21-bedroom, 43,000-square-foot mansion known as Fair Field on 65 oceanfront acres in Sagaponack, on Long Island.\nThe property was valued last March at $248.5 million, real estate records show.\nJurors in Manhattan federal court found Rennert and Renco liable for $118 million to the MagCorp estate. The trial judge, Alison Nathan, later added interest.\nRennert has long said the verdict made no sense because jurors thought MagCorp was solvent at the time of the alleged transfers.\nIn Monday’s complaint, Renco said its former lawyers wrongly failed to object both to jury instructions that led to the “inexplicably inconsistent” verdict, and to the jury’s dismissal after the verdict was read.\nHad the lawyers spoken up, the jury would have announced a verdict “consistent with the 27 interrogatories it answered finding 27 separate times that the (Renco) subsidiaries were not insolvent or inadequately capitalized,” Renco said.\nThe case is Renco Group Inc v Kaye Scholer LLP et al, New York State Supreme Court, New York County, No. 150184/2018.\nReporting by Jonathan Stempel in New York; Editing by Steve Orlofsky\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-09T18:55:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-09T19:07:50.023+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
