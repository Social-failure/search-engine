We have supplemented this organic growth activity with exciting product introductions in both the complex spine and degenerative categories.

We also announced an important strategic collaboration with Brainlab, one of the world's leading imaging and navigation companies, that we believe will represent additional implant sales opportunities in the second half of 2018. Our Brainlab collaboration will complement our recent launches of the BACS® platform and the EVEREST® Minimally Invasive XT Spinal System.”\nMr. Major continued, “We remain confident in our ability to drive above-market growth in the U.S., fueled by our continued focus on leading the spine market by introducing new and innovative spinal implant solutions to help surgeons care for patients around the world who suffer from debilitating spinal pathologies. We expect our revenue to increase 9%–10% in 2018 with improved profitability.”\nThe financial estimates presented above are preliminary and remain subject to management's final review as well as audit by the Company's independent registered public accounting firm. The Company intends to report complete fourth quarter and full-year 2017 financial results in late February.
