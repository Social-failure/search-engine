Trump then told The Wall Street Journal that he will leave his decision on a deal “a little bit flexible” because of the presidential election in Mexico this year. \nKudlow said the U.S. doesn’t want to play into the Mexican election, which could make things “far worse.” \nHe also suspects the Trump administration knows that leaving NAFTA will knock the stock market down. \n“There’s a potential blow up in the stock market if we leave NAFTA. We’re talking agriculture. We’re talking car parts. We’re talking trucking, transportation, energy,” he said.
