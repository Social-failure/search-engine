It expects 2019 capex to be smaller and decrease significantly starting 2020.\nThe company had previously said it would invest 20 trillion won by 2020 to shift its business to OLED, which it sees as the future.\n“This is a very important period where we are in the process of transferring various aspects such as capex and customer profile in order to switch our business,” CFO Don Kim said.\nLG’s operating profit for the quarter ended last month was 44 billion won, the lowest since April-June 2016.\nIt fell significantly short of an average estimate of 250 billion won from 12 analysts polled by Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.\nResults were hit as LCD TV panel prices fell 20-40 percent last year after previous price hikes curbed demand for large-size TVs, said WitsView, part of research provider TrendForce.\nLG expects panel shipments during the current quarter to fall by a high-single digit percentage due to lower seasonal demand, but added that panel prices will likely stabilize at the end of the period.\n“Although short-term earnings might be impacted by LCD panel prices, the share price will be driven by the firm’s progress in the OLED business,” said Park Sung-soon, analyst at Baro Investment & Securities.\n($1 = 1,070.3000 won)\nReporting by Joyce Lee; Editing by Richard Pullin and Himani Sarkar\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-23T00:25:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-23T00:42:29.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
