The statement added that they had been provisionally suspended as of September 2017. \nLev Voronin, the director general of the Russian handball federation, told Reuters: “We think the three athletes’ punishment is too harsh. Our legal services are now preparing all necessary documents to appeal. Regarding the decision on the federation, we just have to wait.” \nThe Russian Under-19 team’s punishment was announced during the ongoing men’s senior European championship in Croatia, for which Russia failed to qualify.
