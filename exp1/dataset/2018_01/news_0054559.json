Mustafa al-Haj Youssef, head of the Idlib civil defense, said more than 35 people had been wounded.\nHe said jets struck a vegetable market north of Saraqib at 8 a.m. (0600 GMT) on Monday. “Directly after, the hospital where the wounded were transferred was targeted, causing injuries among the medical staff, and the hospital went fully out of service,” he told Reuters by phone.\nThe Syrian government says it only targets militants and has repeatedly denied striking civilian facilities such as hospitals.\nReporting by Ellen Francis and Tom Perry; Editing by Janet Lawrence\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-01-29T19:27:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-29T15:10:05.014+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
