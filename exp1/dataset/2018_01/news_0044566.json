Last year’s daily average was 915.3 million rupees. \nForeign investors bought a net 29.4 million rupees worth of shares on Wednesday, extending the year-to-date net foreign inflow to 3.1 billion rupees worth equities. \nForeign investors bought equities worth 18.5 billion rupees last year, and 633.5 million rupees in 2016. \nPresident Maithripala Sirisena said over the weekend that he would handle the economy from this year, taking over from the government’s main coalition partner, led by Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe. \nThe comments have sparked uncertainty over the future of the coalition government, analysts said.
