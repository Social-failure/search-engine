Fellow OPEC member Algeria has estimated output of 1 million bpd.\nReporting by Maher Chmaytelli; Editing by Edmund Blair\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-01-08T20:33:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-09T09:36:46.780+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
