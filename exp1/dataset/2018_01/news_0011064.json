His lawyer Mark Summers said there was a “political genesis” to the allegations against him and noted that a French inquiry into them has been running for several years with no decision having been made to charge anyone.\n“As far as the main allegations are concerned, the understanding is that there hasn’t been any evidence uncovered,” Summers told the court.\nHe said that Djouhri, who holds joint French and Algerian nationality, is a company director of a firm that deals with sanitation, water treatment and solar energy, earning about 200,000 pounds a year and has been based in Switzerland since the 1990s.\nAccording to French media reports over the years, Djouhri had a long career acting as a discreet intermediary between business and political figures in France and North Africa.\nSarkozy has been ordered to stand trial in a separate campaign finance investigation related to events in 2012, when he ran for a second term but was defeated by Francois Hollande.\nReporting by Michael Holden and Estelle Shirbon; editing by Stephen Addison\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-10T15:23:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-10T15:32:13.024+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
