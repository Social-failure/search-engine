(AP) â€” Intel says it's working to patch a security vulnerability in its products but says the average computer user won't experience significant slowdowns as the problem is fixed.\nThe chipmaker released a statement Wednesday after a report by British technology site The Register caused Intel's stock to fall.\nIntel says the problem isn't limited to its products, despite The Register pinning it on Intel's chips. Intel says it's working with other tech companies to address it.\nIntel says it's been responding to new research showing software methods that could be exploited to improperly gather sensitive data from computing devices. Intel says the exploits don't have the potential to corrupt, modify or delete data.\nThe company says it was planning to disclose the issue next week when fixes will be available.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-03T23:01:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-04T01:08:27.004+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
