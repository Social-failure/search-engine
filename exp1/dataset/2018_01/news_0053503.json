Refiners have so far been unsuccessful in convincing the administration of President Donald Trump to reform the program. \nThe PES bankruptcy is a prepackaged deal with near-unanimous support from lenders that could be resolved as early as late February, but the preferred exit plan rests largely on a judge ruling the company does not need to purchase some $180 million worth of compliance credits. \nWithout that, according to a bankruptcy filing, the company would have to purchase the same amount of credits it typically buys over a year in a matter of weeks. \nPES had actually been selling credits in recent months, driving prices down, brokers said. If they aggressively get back into the market, it will drive prices up, brokers said. \n“If they are going to the market, everyone will know, and it will not be pretty,” Ed Hirs, energy economist at the University of Houston, said. \nA source familiar with the company’s plans said PES has a plan to buy the credits without triggering a spike in prices, however. \nThe U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has agreed to extend the deadline for PES to comply with its biofuel credit obligation by 30 days, until May 1, according to a court filing. In exchange, PES agreed to slow down the bankruptcy proceedings. \nPES declined to comment publicly to Reuters. \nPES delayed full compliance of its 2016 obligation last March. It is not permitted to delay compliance in two consecutive years, the source familiar with operations said. \nIf the bankruptcy judge denies its request to shed some outstanding obligations, PES would be forced to tap a $120 million debtor-in-possession loan to help pay for the needed renewable fuel credits, the source said. \nThat, in effect, would mean using borrowed money for daily expenses, the source added.
