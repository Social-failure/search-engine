They are separated and do not interact. Sunlight is rationed by social class. \nIn her day job, Hao is an economist at the state-backed China Development Research Foundation, which promotes economic development and social progress. \nLarge cities in China such as Beijing and Shanghai are hosts to massive populations of migrant workers from the countryside seeking economic opportunities. Cities have also benefited economically from the influx of the vast pool of cheap labor. \nHowever, a strict residency permit system known as \"hukou\" prevents migrant workers from accessing local public services such as education for their children, resulting in numerous social problems. \nHao acknowledged that a key issue in large cities is the demand for public services like education and health care, which she said she hopes the Chinese government can ramp up. \nAuthorities in Beijing have come under unusually direct criticism from a range of intellectuals and commentators recently for the eviction of migrants from their housing. \nAccording to the WEF Inclusive Development Index 2018 released on Monday, China ranks 26th among 74 emerging economies for a composite of a host of economic performance metrics. \n\"China still exhibits high levels of inequality,\" said the report.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-23T07:03:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-23T07:09:51.003+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
