It's created and run by a company called Spotlite, and has licensed the Kodak name. \nHere's how it works: Users pay $3,400 to rent the mining machine for two years. \nKodak claims the KashMiner will produce about $375 worth of new bitcoins every month, which would lead to estimated revenues roughly $9,000 over those two years. \nBut here's the catch: You have to give back half your profits. \nAnd others warn the $375 figure is exaggerated, as those bitcoin returns will diminish every month:", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-11T03:18:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-11T03:33:36.053+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
