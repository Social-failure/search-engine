We don’t move so quickly. This does not reflect our mentality,” he added in a reference to separate negotiations Brussels is conducting with Britain over terms of its exit from the bloc.\nMaurer said it was time to be realistic with Brussels about prospects for a deal after Swiss officials had sent mixed signals about a treaty to replace a patchwork of 120 bilateral accords that now govern ties between Switzerland and its most important trading partner.\nRelations with the European Union soured in December as Bern threatened retaliation over what it called unacceptable limitations on Swiss stock exchanges’ access to the single market.\nThe row threatened to set back ties that had been thawing after the Swiss parliament in 2016 skirted voters’ demands for immigration quotas for EU citizens.\nThe anti-immigration SVP has long opposed a new treaty that would give the European Court of Justice a say in settling disputes. But leading politicians from mainstream conservative parties have also expressed reservations about rushing into a deal before the outcome of Brexit negotiations is clear.\nReporting by\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-26T10:03:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-26T10:13:16.024+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
