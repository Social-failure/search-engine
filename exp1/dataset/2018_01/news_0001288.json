I‘m simply here to apologize,” Paul said in a YouTube video called “So Sorry.” \nHe said the shots of he and his friends laughing nervously after the discovery of the body were “raw and unfiltered” reactions and that the video should never have been posted or even filmed. \n“I’ve made a huge mistake. I don’t expect to be forgiven... I‘m ashamed of myself. I am disappointed,” he added. \nLogan shot the video on a visit to Japan’s Aokigahara forest on the slopes of Mount Fuji, that is known for its high number of suicides. He promoted it on his Twitter account at the weekend as “the craziest and most real video I’ve ever uploaded.” \nReaction was swift with critics calling the video disgusting and tasteless. \n“Paul believes he’s ‘making YouTube history’ by vlogging the body of a young person who died by suicide... You’re not Neil Armstrong bro, it’s simply a thing no one else has been tacky enough to do outside rotten. com circa 2000,” tweeted Caitlin Doughty, a Los Angeles mortician and author of “From Here to Eternity.” \nFormer “Breaking Bad” star Aaron Paul said suicide was no joke. “You disgust me. I can’t believe that so many young people look up to you,” the actor tweeted to Paul, who he is not related to. “Hopefully this latest video woke them up. You are pure trash. Plain and simple. Suicide is not a joke. Go rot in hell.” Reporting by Jill Serjeant; Editing by Andrew Hay", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-02T20:46:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-02T20:57:08.002+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
