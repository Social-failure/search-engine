Gulen, who has lived in self-imposed exile in the United States since 1999, has denied the charges and condemned the coup. \nSince the abortive putsch, more than 50,000 people, including civil servants and security personnel, have been jailed pending trial and some 150,000 suspended or dismissed from their jobs.
