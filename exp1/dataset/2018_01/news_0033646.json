Last year Vivendi appealed against this ruling.\nOn its website the regional court said the appeal hearing would be held on July 4. It was previously set for Feb. 7.\nOne source close to the matter said the postponement was requested by Vivendi, after discussions with AGCOM, to buy time while the French group was in negotiations with Mediaset to find a way out over a failed pay-TV deal.\nWhen the dispute over the pay-TV deal erupted, Vivendi quickly built a 28.8 percent stake in the Italian broadcaster. The French group also holds a 24 percent stake in Telecom Italia (TIM).\nReporting by Stefano Rebaudo and Francesca Landini; Writing by Francesca Landini; Editing by Andrew Bolton\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-01-20T18:58:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-21T13:21:05.017+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
