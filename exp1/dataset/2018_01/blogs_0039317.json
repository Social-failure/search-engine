A set of six ninth row seats along the 40-yard line are currently going for $12,900 each on SeatGeek , while one pair of seats in the same area on the NFC team’s side (with unlimited food and drinks) are available for $66,650 each. \nOn VividSeats, the average price for a ticket to the Super Bowl now stands at $5,694, the company says. That’s an 8.09% increase compared to this time last year, two weeks before Super Bowl LI. \nTicket prices actually saw a surge when the Vikings went up 7-0 against the Eagles in the first quarter of Sunday’s game. At kickoff, the average asking price was around $4,500, but after that drive, it spiked to $5,400, according to ESPN . By the time the game was over, the price was back in the $4,500-$4,700 range. (VividSeats says it saw the median price for listed tickets jump to $6,918 early in the second quarter. That has since fallen about $500.) \nTicket prices aren’t the only thing going for outrageous prices. As of Monday morning, one Ramada hotel in Minneapolis was asking $909 per night for a room with a king-sized bed. That’s a 1,196% markup from the usual rate.
