Its partners may be happy to shoulder its share of the work but in some cases they will be obliged to, and it might not benefit them.\nWhere JVs have weak profitability or other problems, taking on even more of that business may hit earnings. Balfour Beatty and Galliford Try shares fell 2.4 percent and 3.5 percent respectively on Monday as they detailed the additional cost of completing projects in which they were a partner with Carillion.\nAnalysts see little major supply chain disruption because the industry had time to prepare, although shares in Speedy Hire ( SDY.L ) - which counts Carillion among its biggest customers - dived 8 percent on Monday.\nThat share price fall “looks a little bit harsh but it’s trying to price in all of the downside,” said Tetley, who estimates Carillion was about 4 percent of Speedy Hire’s sales.\nAdditional reporting by Tricia Wright, Kit Rees and Alasdair Pal; ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-15T15:37:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-15T15:54:08.004+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
