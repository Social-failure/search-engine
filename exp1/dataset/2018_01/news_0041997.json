The stock has already risen 23 percent in 2018 after a 73 percent climb last year. \nSunnyvale, California-based Intuitive has enjoyed a near monopoly in the abdominal surgical robots market since launching its flagship device called da Vinci in 2000. \nBut the company has in recent months ramped up spending on product development to remain ahead of competition. \nIts operating expenses rose 16.6 percent year-over-year to $306.3 million in the quarter ended Dec. 31. \nThe company shipped 216 da Vinci systems in the quarter, compared with 163 in the prior-year period. \nIntuitive reported a net loss of $38.8 million or 35 cents per share in the quarter ended Dec. 31, compared with a profit of $204 million or $1.71 per share, a year earlier. \nThe loss reflected a $318 million expense related to new U.S. tax laws. \nExcluding the expense, the company earned $2.54 per share, ahead of analysts’ average estimate of $2.24, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. \nRevenue rose 17.9 percent to $892.4 million.
