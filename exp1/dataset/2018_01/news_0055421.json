We are concerned by the rhetoric and propaganda employed in the region, playing out daily in Arab mainstream and social media.\"\nSaudi Arabia, the UAE, Egypt and Bahrain cut diplomatic ties and cut off transport links with Qatar in June 2017, accusing it of supporting Islamist groups and destabilizing the region, allegations that Qatar denies.\nSaudi Arabia and its allies say they are boycotting the country rather than blockading it, but Qatar says its neighbors' actions are unjustified. The sanctions have weakened its economy slightly, according to official government data.\nRelations deteriorated further in late summer 2017 after Qatar restored diplomatic relations with Saudi Arabia's arch-rival Iran, ties that had been cut in 2016 after attacks on Saudi Arabia's embassy in Iran.\nTone down the rhetoric Attending the strategic dialogue meeting with the U.S. Secretary of Defense James Mattis, Tillerson urged both sides in the dispute to tone down the rhetoric.\n\"It is critical that all parties minimize rhetoric, exercise restraint to avoid further escalation, and work toward a resolution,\" he said, adding that a united Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) \"bolsters our effectiveness on many fronts, particularly on counterterror â€” countering terrorism, defeating ISIS, and countering the spread of Iran's malign influence.\"\nThe GCC is an economic and political alliance of six countries, comprising Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates.\nTim De Waele | Corbis | Getty Images The skyline of Doha, Qatar.
