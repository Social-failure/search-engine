But 20 nations agreed on Tuesday to consider tougher sanctions to press North Korea to give up its nuclear weapons. \nGuk Kim Il, President of the Olympic Committee of the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea (DPRK), arrived at Geneva’s Cointrin airport on a flight from Beijing, but made no comments to reporters. \nNorth Korean IOC member Chang Ung met the delegation. Asked whether he expected North Korea and South Korea to settle outstanding issues at Saturday’s talks, he appeared optimistic.

They plan to march together under the same blue-and-white Korean peninsula flag, marking the revival of an emblem of warmer ties between the old foes from years past.
