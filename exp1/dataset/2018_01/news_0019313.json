I am really looking forward to the rest of the year,” Kerber said in a court-side interview after claiming a first title since her U.S. Open triumph. \n“I am playing amazing tennis again and I am just feeling great.” Tennis - Sydney International - Sydney Olympic Park, Sydney, Australia, January 13, 2018.
