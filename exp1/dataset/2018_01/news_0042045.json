London has shown it has the course for world records to be broken and I hope my form and health stay strong and that the weather is kind on the day.” \nKeitany will be challenged by Ethiopian rival Tirunesh Dibaba, who confirmed her participation on Tuesday, while last year’s world champion Rose Chelimo will also be part of the elite women’s field for the April 22 event.
