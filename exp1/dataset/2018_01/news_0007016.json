A rise above $1.2092 would take it to its highest level since January 2015.\nThe euro received its latest boost overnight as data showed the euro zone economy closed out 2017 with the strongest growth in nearly seven years.\nWeighed down by the greenback’s weakness against the euro, the dollar index against a basket of six major currencies was poised on a loss of 0.3 percent this week, during which it probed a three-month low of 91.751. The index was also headed for its third week of losses.\nThe U.S. currency’s weakness was highlighted overnight as the dollar failed to draw support from stronger-than-expected jobs report. U.S. private employers added 250,000 jobs in December, data from ADP Research Institute showed, the biggest monthly increase since March.\nThe markets are now focused on Friday’s U.S. non-farm payrolls report, which is expected to show job gains of 190,000 for December.\nGiven the dollar’s recent poor showing, market participants reckon stronger-than-expected employment gains and growth in wages would be needed to turn fortunes around for the currency.\n“It is the same theme from 2017 that is hurting the dollar, which is low inflation concerns, which in turn has capped Treasury yields,” said Junichi Ishikawa, senior FX strategist at IG Securities in Tokyo.\n“The euro, on the other hand, is on a roll. We see the euro zone HICP figures out later today and if that proves to be strong, that could offset a decent U.S. jobs report from the dollar’s perspective,” Ishikawa said.\nThe euro zone’s harmonised index of consumer prices (HICP) for December is due later on Friday.\nThe Australian dollar extended gains from the previous day and rose to $0.7869, its highest since Oct. 20.\nThe Aussie was on track for its fourth straight week of gains, with the recent surge in prices of commodities like copper and iron ore providing a lift.\nThe Canadian dollar has also benefited from surging commodities, with crude oil prices at their highest since 2015.\nThe loonie was headed for its third straight week of gains, having touched a 2-1/2-month high of C$1.2485 per dollar overnight.\nThe yen was an exception among the major currencies, having sunk this week against its peers like the dollar, euro and Aussie.\nThe Japanese currency depreciated against the broadly weaker greenback due to increasing investor appetite for risk in the broader markets, which dimmed its allure as a perceived safe haven.\nThe dollar was little changed at 112.790 yen after rising about 0.2 percent on Thursday. It was little changed against the yen this week, during which it had momentarily slipped to a two-week low of 112.055 on Tuesday.
