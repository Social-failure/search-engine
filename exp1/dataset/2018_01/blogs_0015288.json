A 30-mile section of U.S. 101 has been closed due to the debris, making search efforts difficult. \nMontecito is a town of 8,900 people outside Santa Barbara, about 85 miles northwest of Los Angeles. Homeowners reportedly include Oprah Winfrey, Drew Barrymore, Ellen DeGeneres and Alphabet's Eric Schmidt. \nHere are scenes from the devastation.
