This clarification of the regulatory framework should help to ensure that Switzerland remains an attractive location in this area,” the ministry statement said. \nBitcoin, the world’s biggest and best-know cryptocurrency, fell as much as 20 percent on Wednesday, while other cryptocurrencies took similar spills due to investor fears that regulators could clamp down on them in an effort to curb speculation.
