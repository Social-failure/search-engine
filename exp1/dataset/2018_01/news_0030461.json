If we agree on the roadmap and agree that I have a major contribution, we keep going. If there is no agreement ... then we stop,” he said.\nRenault’s main shareholders are the French state and Nissan, which itself is 43.4 percent owned by Renault.\nGhosn said that questions over the French state’s role in Renault was one for the state to answer, but he added that the French government played a key role in the health of the country’s car industry.\nLast November the French government began the sale of 4.73 percent of Renault, paring back its holding to the 15 percent level that preceded a 2015 power struggle with Ghosn and removing a residual irritant in their relationship.\nReporting by Gilles Guillaume; Writing by Sudip Kar-Gupta and Leigh Thomas; Editing by David Goodman\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-18T01:48:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-17T20:58:00.022+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
