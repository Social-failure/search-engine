Anecdotal evidence pointed to stronger market demand from home and international markets.”\nThe country’s manufacturing sector witnessed higher payroll figures in December while the rate of job creation rose to its highest since August 2012.\nA worker cuts iron rods outside a workshop at an iron and steel market in an industrial area in New Delhi, India, December 12, 2017. REUTERS/Adnan Abidi The latest survey showed the new orders sub-index, a proxy for domestic demand, also rose to 56.8 in December, the highest since October 2016.\nForeign demand also expanded at its quickest pace since June.\n“Challenges remain as the economy adjusts to recent shocks, but the overall upturn was robust compared to the trend observed for the survey history. This outlook was shared by the manufacturing community as sentiment picked-up to the strongest in three months amid expected improvements in market conditions over the next 12 months,” Dodhia added.\nAt the same time, stronger demand allowed firms to raise prices at the fastest pace in 10 months to make up for rising input costs, suggesting overall inflation could remain above the central bank’s medium-term target of 4.0 percent in the coming month.\nIndia’s retail inflation in November breached the central bank’s medium-term target of 4 percent, which could put pressure on it to raise policy rates in the coming months.\nMinutes from the RBI’s December meeting show bank members are becoming increasingly concerned about inflation.\nReporting by Vivek Mishra; Editing by Sam Holmes\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-01-02T13:13:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-02T18:19:12.007+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
