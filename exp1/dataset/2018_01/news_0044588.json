He faces six years in jail if convicted of taking money for supplying the hideout. Prison wardens block the Maubeuge jail during a nationwide protest, France, January 24, 2018. REUTERS/Pascal Rossignol DEMANDS \nTwo-thirds of France’s 188 prisons were being disrupted by work stoppages and pickets on Wednesday morning, according to an official count. Slideshow (2 Images) \nAmong the demands of the striking prison guards is that militant Islamist convicts -- those convicted of terrorism-related offences - be isolated from other prisoners, saying that some inmates are becoming radicalised through contact with them. \nThe wardens also want more money for a job they say is becoming increasingly dangerous and equipment such as taser guns to help ensure order. \nThe protests began on Jan. 12 after an al Qaeda convict jailed over killings in Tunisia stabbed and injured two wardens with a pair of scissors in northern France. \nIn some cases over the past 12 days, police have been sent into prisons to do the job of the striking wardens, and prisoners have been forced to spend more time in their cells. \nSome jail cells house as many as three or four inmates in a space of 10 square metres (yards).
