REUTERS/Toby Melville In Brussels, EU ministers, whose unity in the negotiations has amplified the arguments in Britain, are due to formally endorse its guidelines for a transition period that will leave the relationship largely unchanged.\nBut even with both sides mostly in agreement over the transition period bar a few questions over citizens rights and trade agreements, May faces criticism by Brexit campaigners for bowing to EU demands and accepting the status quo.\n“GET A GRIP”\nLarry the Downing Street cat and Palmerston the Foreign Office cat square off outside Britain's Prime Minister's official residence 10 Downing Street, London, January 29, 2018. REUTERS/Toby Melville Since being appointed prime minister shortly after the “Remain” side, which she backed, lost a referendum on EU membership in June 2016, May’s style of leadership has been increasingly challenged by her party, which is losing support at a time when the opposition Labour Party is enjoying record levels of members.\nHer spokesman defended the prime minister’s record, saying she had not only won an agreement with the EU to move onto the second phase of negotiations on future ties, she had also boosted housebuilding, education standards and health funding.\nBrexit campaigners have aired their concerns that May is delivering a Brexit in name only, while EU supporters accuse her of putting the party’s interests above those of the country in the talks to end more than 40 years of membership in the bloc.\nRelated Coverage Factbox: The EU's Brexit transition demands -- and what they mean Talk of ousting her has grown louder in recent days, with local media reporting that more MPs are supporting a no-confidence motion against her.\nBut several MPs asked by Reuters say her removal is a risky strategy for the party, which is divided down the middle over Brexit. The promotion of either side’s representatives to the top post could trigger mutiny.\n“There were times last year for the prime minister to step aside - immediately after the June 2017 election, or after Party Conference. That didn’t happen. Maybe the Cabinet should have asked her to go, but they didn‘t,” said Nicky Morgan, education minister under May’s predecessor, David Cameron.\n“Even more importantly, we are now into a critical nine months for the future of the country, so the cabinet need to get a grip by acting collectively to shape Brexit and agree an ideal end-state based in reality, on what parliament will approve eventually - and then stick to it.”\nReporting by Andrew MacAskill and Elizabeth Piper; Editing by Jeremy Gaunt\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-29T02:04:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-29T03:56:01.015+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
