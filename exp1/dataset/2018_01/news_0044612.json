REUTERS/Leonhard Foeger \nThere are reservations about Lauda among Niki employees as previously he has not provided contracts under a collective wage agreement. \nAsked about the possibility there might be not enough pilots to restart operations in the Spring, Tankovits said: “This is to be feared ... that will certainly become a critical issue.” Slideshow (2 Images) \nTankovits, who is a pilot himself, said around 180 pilots were needed to operate the 15 planes. \nHe called on Lauda to talk to staff representatives about future conditions and pay. “I think it is very important to reach consensus with the staff to convince them to stay.” \nNiki planes have been granted around 1,700 slots, or about 0.8 percent of available slots in Austria, for the summer season which begins late March. The airline plans to focus on tourist destinations in Turkey, Greece and Spain.
