The other two Kam Air staffers killed were from Venezuela. \nMost of the other foreign staff have left the country, crippling operations. \n“We used to have 37 flights a day on average. We now have about seven,” Ramin Youresh, business development director for the Kam group of companies, told Reuters. \n“Most domestic flights are cancelled because we don’t have the crew and we don’t have the airplanes.” \nKam Air, one of three main Afghan airlines, provides links between major cities in a country where travel by road is often dangerous and unreliable. It also flies some international routes in the region. \nIt was the second time in less than a year that a major private company in Afghanistan had suffered a devastating loss. More than 30 employees of mobile phone company Roshan Telecommunications were killed in a truck bomb attack near the German embassy in Kabul in May last year. \nKam Air had 62 expatriate staff, both pilots and cabin crew, who used the Intercontinental as their Kabul base. About 40 of them were in the hotel at the time of the attack. \n“Most of them have left, they’re in a bad way, they’re in shock. They need three or four weeks to recover, then decide if they are willing to come back,” Youresh said. \n“We expect most won’t come back.” NEED HELP Kam Air local crew carry a coffin of an Ukrainian employee of the Kam Air Afghan airline, who was killed during an attack in Intercontinental Hotel this week, in Kabul, Afghanistan January 24, 2018. REUTERS/Omar Sobhani \nOf the airlines’ foreign staff members, up to 40 were from Ukraine while the airline also leased six planes from two Ukrainian companies. \nBut two of the Ukrainian aircraft had left the country after orders from home to suspend operations, Youresh said. \n“Four are still here but the question is if we get a green light for them to operate,” he said. \nThe attack on the Intercontinental Hotel caused some of the heaviest casualties among foreigners in Afghanistan for years. As well as the Ukrainians and Venezuelans from Kam Air, an unknown number of Americans and one German citizen have been confirmed killed.

They would feel much safer there,” Youresh said. \nMany foreign technicians and contractors in Kabul live in heavily protected compounds, several of them close to the airport, but their living conditions are relatively spartan. \nOn Wednesday, Afghan Kam Air staff saw off the bodies of their seven Ukrainian colleagues at a ceremony at Kabul airport.
