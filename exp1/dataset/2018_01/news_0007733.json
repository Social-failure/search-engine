I can compete - but I don’t want to just compete, I want to do far better than that and to do so, I will need a little more time,” Williams said in a statement. \nWilliams had told Vogue magazine last August about her “outrageous plan” to defend her title but the short turnaround after giving birth has proven too much for even the greatest player of her generation. \nWilliams, whose grand slam tally is just one shy of the all-time record held by Australian Margaret Court, said she was disappointed to withdraw but looked forward to returning in the future.
