Between April and December, the state generated 78 million tonnes of iron ore, including 14.57 million tonnes produced by the seven mines that have now been shut down, Deepak Kumar Mohanty, Odisha’s mining director, told Reuters.\n“Even if these mines are closed, there is scope to reach to 100 million tonnes because other operational mines can enhance production,” Mohanty said.\nThe mines that were forced to close down include those operated by state-owned Industrial Development Corporation Of Odisha Ltd.\nAfter finding 131 miners guilty of violating environmental and other guidelines, the Supreme Court last year levied penalties on them.\nBut the state government of Odisha has so far recovered only 82.49 billion rupees ($1.3 billion) as against 190 billion rupees of combined penalties.\nSome miners had petitioned the Supreme Court to extend the deadline, but the court rejected this.\n($1 = 63.46 rupees)\nWriting by Neha Dasgupta; editing by Mayank Bhardwaj and David Evans\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-02T13:47:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-02T14:13:32.017+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
