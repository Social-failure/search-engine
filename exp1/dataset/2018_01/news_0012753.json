They surfaced on Twitter minutes after he accepted a best comedy actor Golden Globe on Sunday for his role in “The Disaster Artist.” \nFranco also is nominated for a Screen Actors Guild award for the role at a Jan. 21 ceremony in Los Angeles. \nThree women made comments on Twitter alleging sexual misbehavior by Franco, who on Sunday was wearing a Time’s Up movement pin supporting victims of sexual harassment in the wider workplace. Some of the tweets were later deleted. FILE PHOTO: Actor and honoree James Franco poses at the inaugural IndieWire Honors in Los Angeles, California, U.S., November 2, 2017.

So, if I’ve done something wrong, I will fix it. I have to,” he said without elaborating. \nFranco’s representatives did not respond to requests for further comment on Wednesday. \nSunday’s Golden Globe ceremony was marked by jokes and powerful speeches about the sexual misconduct scandal that has roiled Hollywood and led to dozens of men being fired, forced to stand down or dropped from creative projects.
