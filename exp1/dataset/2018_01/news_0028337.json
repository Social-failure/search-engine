Ryanair said it had agreed with BALPA that the pay increases should not be delayed by their negotiations.\nRyanair added that it had asked the one-third of pilots in another of its major European hubs in Dublin that have yet to accept the pay increases to vote on its proposals by Jan. 17 but was disappointed that no such vote was organised.\nTalks with the pilots’ unions are progressing slowly, it said.
