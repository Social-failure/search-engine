Trump also wants tighter restrictions on Iran’s ballistic missile program. \nIran has rejected any renegotiation.

REUTERS/Toby Melville \nTillerson said the nuclear deal was only a “small” part of U.S. policy in the Middle East and Washington was more immediately concerned about other issues including Iran’s support for the Houthi rebels in Yemen and its supplying weapons to militias in the region. \n“Our work group also is intending to identify areas of greater cooperation (with) Europe to push back on Iran’s malign behaviour,” he said. RUSSIA BLAMED \nDespite statements from Russia earlier this week that Washington’s accusations against Moscow that it and the Syrian army were behind a chemical attack in eastern Ghouta were “unfounded”, Tillerson reiterated that ultimately Russia bore responsibility. \n“I stand by my comments,” he said. \n“The chemical weapons ... are being used to hit the civilian population, the most vulnerable - children inside of Syria ... We are holding Russia responsible for addressing this. They are (Bashar al-) Assad’s ally.” \nRussia is providing direct military support in Syria against various rebel groups trying to oust Assad, and giving diplomatic cover in the U.N.
