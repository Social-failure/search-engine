Roche said Balovaptan has shown the potential to improve social interaction and communication in people with ASD. \n“We look forward to working closely with the FDA in the hope that we can bring this medicine to these individuals as quickly as possible,” said Roche Chief Medical Officer Sandra Horning. \nRoche’s pRED research and development unit has historically lagged the output of its California-based Genentech unit, the source of nearly all its biggest sellers. \nStill, the Basel-based company has begun highlighting several pRED medicines, including Balovaptan, as among its top drug prospects.
