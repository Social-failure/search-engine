REUTERS/Faisal Mahmood \n“(Sharif) has announced Rs 10 million (£66,428) for anyone giving information about the kidnapper,” Punjab government spokesman Malik Muhammad Ahmad Khan told Reuters. He said it could not be ruled out that the murders involved a serial killer. \nA police official speaking on condition on anonymity said two of Ansari’s relatives had been interrogated and 26 locals are currently in custody and being questioned. He added that police are waiting for forensic evidence to be collected and analysed. \nAnsari’s family doubts justice will be done.
