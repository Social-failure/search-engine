After preferred dividends, net income available to common shareholders was $486 million, or $0.67 per diluted share, in the fourth quarter 2017, compared with $999 million, or $1.35 per diluted share, in the third quarter of 2017, and $372 million, or $0.49 per diluted share, in the fourth quarter of 2016. Results were significantly impacted by a Vantiv-related transaction in the third quarter of 2017 and items resulting from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act in the fourth quarter of 2017.\n“Our strong fourth quarter and full year 2017 results reflect continued progress toward achieving our long term financial goals. Our business strategies are well aligned with the interests of our shareholders, our customers, our employees, and the communities we serve.

Excluding the remeasurement, taxable equivalent net interest income of $990 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 was up $13 million, or 1 percent from the prior quarter, reflecting higher interest earning asset yields as well as the continued shift into higher yielding consumer loans. The taxable equivalent net interest margin of 3.02 percent was negatively impacted 8 bps from the aforementioned remeasurement. The adjusted taxable equivalent net interest margin was 3.10 percent, up 3 bps sequentially, primarily driven by higher securities portfolio and consumer loan yields, partially offset by an increase in funding costs associated with deposit rate changes and the full quarter impact of an auto securitization executed in third quarter of 2017.\nCompared to the fourth quarter of 2016, taxable equivalent net interest income was up $54 million, or 6 percent, primarily driven by higher short-term market rates and the $16 million estimated card refund charge during the fourth quarter of 2016, partially offset by the aforementioned leveraged lease remeasurement. Excluding the leveraged lease remeasurement and the estimated card refund charge, adjusted taxable equivalent net interest income was up 7 percent. The year-over-year increase was primarily driven by higher short-term market rates. The taxable equivalent net interest margin increased 16 bps from the fourth quarter of 2016, primarily driven by higher short-term market rates and a 5 bps positive impact from the estimated card refund charge, partially offset by a negative 8 bps impact from the leveraged lease remeasurement. Excluding the remeasurement and card refunds impact, adjusted taxable equivalent net interest margin was up 19 bps from the fourth quarter of 2016. The year-over-year increase was primarily driven by higher-short-term market rates.\nSecurities\nAverage securities and other short-term investments were $33.8 billion in the fourth quarter of 2017 compared to $33.8 billion in the previous quarter and $32.6 billion in the fourth quarter of 2016. Available-for-sale securities were $31.8 billion in the fourth quarter of 2017 up $340 million, or 1 percent, sequentially and up $637 million, or 2 percent, from the fourth quarter of 2016.\nLoans ($ in millions) For the Three Months Ended % Change December September June March December 2017 2017 2017 2017 2016 Seq Yr/Yr Average Portfolio Loans and Leases Commercial loans and leases: Commercial and industrial loans $41,438 $41,302 $41,601 $41,854 $42,548 - (3%) Commercial mortgage loans 6,751 6,807 6,845 6,941 6,957 (1%) (3%) Commercial construction loans 4,660 4,533 4,306 3,987 3,890 3% 20% Commercial leases 4,016 4,072 4,036 3,901 3,921 (1%) 2% Total commercial loans and leases $56,865 $56,714 $56,788 $56,683 $57,316 - (1%) Consumer loans and leases: Residential mortgage loans $15,590 $15,523 $15,417 $15,200 $14,854 - 5% Home equity 7,066 7,207 7,385 7,581 7,779 (2%) (9%) Automobile loans 9,175 9,267 9,410 9,786 10,162 (1%) (10%) Credit card 2,202 2,140 2,080 2,141 2,180 3% 1% Other consumer loans and leases 1,352 1,055 892 755 673 28% NM Total consumer loans and leases $35,385 $35,192 $35,184 $35,463 $35,648 1% (1%) Total average portfolio loans and leases $92,250 $91,906 $91,972 $92,146 $92,964 - (1%) Average loans held for sale $615 $711 $681 $645 $1,017 (14%) (40%) Average portfolio loan and lease balances were flat sequentially and decreased 1 percent from the fourth quarter of 2016. Sequential performance was primarily driven by increases in commercial real estate and other consumer loans and leases, offset by decreases in home equity and automobile loans. The year-over-year decrease was primarily driven by declines in commercial and industrial (C&I) and automobile loans, partially offset by increases in commercial real estate and other consumer loans and leases. Period end portfolio loans and leases of $92.0 billion were flat sequentially and year-over-year.\nAverage commercial portfolio loan and lease balances were flat sequentially, and decreased 1 percent from the fourth quarter of 2016. Sequential performance was primarily driven by an increase in commercial real estate loans, offset by a decrease in commercial leases. Average C&I loans were flat sequentially and decreased 3 percent from the fourth quarter of 2016. The year-over-year decline in C&I loans was primarily due to deliberate exits from certain C&I loans that did not meet our targeted risk or return profile. Average commercial real estate loans increased $71 million, or 1 percent, from the prior quarter and increased $564 million, or 5 percent, from the fourth quarter of 2016. Period end commercial line utilization of 34 percent was flat from both the third quarter of 2017 and the fourth quarter of 2016.\nAverage consumer portfolio loan and lease balances were up 1 percent sequentially and decreased 1 percent from the fourth quarter of 2016. The sequential increase was primarily driven by the increase in other consumer loans and leases, partially offset by a decline in average home equity loans. The year-over-year decrease was primarily driven by the decline in average automobile loans which continues to reflect a decision to reduce lower-return originations to improve returns on capital.\nDeposits ($ in millions) For the Three Months Ended % Change December September June March December 2017 2017 2017 2017 2016 Seq Yr/Yr Average Deposits Demand $35,519 $34,850 $34,915 $35,084 $36,412 2% (2%) Interest checking 26,992 25,765 26,014 26,760 25,644 5% 5% Savings 13,593 13,889 14,238 14,117 13,979 (2%) (3%) Money market 20,023 20,028 20,278 20,603 20,476 - (2%) Foreign office (f) 323 395 380 454 497 (18%) (35%) Total transaction deposits $96,450 $94,927 $95,825 $97,018 $97,008 2% (1%) Other time 3,792 3,722 3,745 3,827 3,941 2% (4%) Total core deposits $100,242 $98,649 $99,570 $100,845 $100,949 2% (1%) Certificates - $100,000 and over 2,429 2,625 2,623 2,579 2,539 (7%) (4%) Other 119 560 264 162 115 (79%) 3% Total average deposits $102,790 $101,834 $102,457 $103,586 $103,603 1% (1%) Average core deposits increased 2 percent sequentially and decreased 1 percent from the fourth quarter of 2016. Average transaction deposits increased 2 percent sequentially and decreased 1 percent from the fourth quarter of 2016. The sequential increase was primarily driven by increases in commercial interest checking deposit and commercial demand deposit account balances, partially offset by lower consumer savings and commercial money market account balances. Year-over-year performance was primarily driven by lower commercial money market and commercial demand deposit account balances, largely offset by higher consumer money market and commercial interest checking deposit account balances. Other time deposits increased by 2 percent sequentially and decreased 4 percent year-over-year.\nAverage total commercial transaction deposits of $43 billion increased 4 percent sequentially and decreased 4 percent from the fourth quarter of 2016.

The sequential decline was primarily due to a decrease in other short-term borrowings reflecting higher core deposit balances, partially offset by an increase in long-term debt from 3-year bank debt issued in October of 2017. The year-over-year results reflect an increase in other short-term borrowings, largely offset by a decrease in long-term debt.\nNoninterest Income ($ in millions) For the Three Months Ended % Change December September June March December 2017 2017 2017 2017 2016 Seq Yr/Yr Noninterest Income Service charges on deposits $138 $138 $139 $138 $141 - (2%) Corporate banking revenue 77 101 101 74 101 (24%) (24%) Mortgage banking net revenue 54 63 55 52 65 (14%) (17%) Wealth and asset management revenue 106 102 103 108 100 4% 6% Card and processing revenue 80 79 79 74 79 1% 1% Other noninterest income 123 1,076 85 77 137 (89%) (10%) Securities gains (losses), net 1 - - - (3) NM NM Securities gains (losses), net - non-qualifying hedges on mortgage servicing rights (2) 2 2 - - NM NM Total noninterest income $577 $1,561 $564 $523 $620 (63%) (7%) Noninterest income of $577 million decreased $984 million sequentially and decreased $43 million compared with prior year results.

The sequential increase was primarily due to $44 million in revenue recognized from Vantiv related to the tax receivable agreement in the fourth quarter of 2017, and an increase in wealth and asset management revenue. This was partially offset by declines in corporate banking and mortgage banking revenue. Corporate banking revenue was negatively impacted by a $25 million lease remarketing impairment in the fourth quarter of 2017. The year-over-year decrease was driven by lower corporate banking and mortgage banking revenue.\nCorporate banking revenue of $77 million was down 24 percent both sequentially and year-over-year. The sequential and year-over-year decreases were primarily driven by the aforementioned lease remarketing impairment. Excluding the impact of the lease impairment, corporate banking revenue was flat sequentially and year-over-year.\nMortgage Banking Net Revenue ($ in millions) For the Three Months Ended % Change December September June March December 2017 2017 2017 2017 2016 Seq Yr/Yr Mortgage Banking Net Revenue Origination fees and gains on loan sales $32 $40 $37 $29 $30 (20%) 7% Net mortgage servicing revenue: Gross mortgage servicing fees 54 56 49 47 48 (4%) 13% MSR amortization - - - - (35) NM NM Net valuation adjustments on MSRs and (32) (33) (31) (24) 22 (3%) NM free-standing derivatives purchased to economically hedge MSRs Net mortgage servicing revenue 22 23 18 23 35 (4%) (37%) Total mortgage banking net revenue $54 $63 $55 $52 $65 (14%) (17%) Mortgage banking net revenue was $54 million in the fourth quarter of 2017, down $9 million from the third quarter of 2017 and down $11 million from the fourth quarter of 2016. The sequential decrease was driven by lower origination fees and gains on loan sales. The year-over-year decrease was driven by a reduction in net valuation adjustments (including MSR amortization) of $19 million. Originations of $1.9 billion in the current quarter decreased 10 percent sequentially and decreased 30 percent from the fourth quarter of 2016.\nWealth and asset management revenue of $106 million increased 4 percent from the third quarter of 2017 and increased 6 percent from the fourth quarter of 2016. The sequential and year-over-year increase was primarily driven by higher personal asset management revenue.\nCard and processing revenue of $80 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 was up 1 percent both sequentially and year-over-year. The sequential and year-over-year performance reflected increased credit card spend volume, largely offset by higher rewards.\nOther noninterest income totaled $123 million in the fourth quarter of 2017, compared with $1.076 billion in the previous quarter and $137 million in the fourth quarter of 2016.

For the fourth quarter of 2017, excluding these items, other noninterest income of $134 million increased approximately $48 million, or 56 percent, from the third quarter of 2017 and increased $12 million, or 10 percent, from the fourth quarter of 2016. The sequential increase was primarily due to the $44 million in revenue recognized from Vantiv related to the tax receivable agreement in the fourth quarter of 2017. The year-over-year increase was due to an $11 million increase in the aforementioned tax receivable agreement.\nNet gains on investment securities were $1 million in the fourth quarter of 2017, compared with no gains or losses in the third quarter of 2017 and a $3 million net loss in the fourth quarter of 2016.

Results reflected the affordable housing impairment, one-time employee bonuses, and the Fifth Third Foundation contribution referenced on page 2. Excluding these items, noninterest expense of $975 million was flat compared with the third quarter of 2017, impacted by lower other noninterest expense and salaries, wages and incentives, offset by higher employee benefits and technology and communications expense. Excluding the aforementioned items, noninterest expense increased 2 percent compared to the fourth quarter of 2016, impacted by higher employee benefits and technology and communications expense, offset by lower other noninterest expense.\nSummary of Credit Loss Experience ($ in millions) For the Three Months Ended December September June March December 2017 2017 2017 2017 2016 Net losses charged-off Commercial and industrial loans ($32) ($27) ($18) ($36) ($25) Commercial mortgage loans 1 (3) (5) (5) (2) Commercial leases (1) - (1) (1) (1) Residential mortgage loans (1) 1 (2) (5) (2) Home equity (4) (3) (5) (6) (6) Automobile loans (10) (8) (6) (11) (11) Credit card (20) (20) (22) (22) (19) Other consumer loans and leases (9) (8) (5) (3) (7) Total net losses charged-off ($76) ($68) ($64) ($89) ($73) Total losses charged-off ($94) ($85) ($95) ($107) ($97) Total recoveries of losses previously charged-off 18 17 31 18 24 Total net losses charged-off ($76) ($68) ($64) ($89) ($73) Ratios (annualized) Net losses charged-off as a percent of average portfolio loans and leases (excluding held for sale) 0.33% 0.29% 0.28% 0.40% 0.31% Commercial 0.22% 0.21% 0.17% 0.29% 0.20% Consumer 0.51% 0.43% 0.46% 0.56% 0.49% Net charge-offs were $76 million, or 33 bps of average portfolio loans and leases on an annualized basis, in the fourth quarter of 2017 compared with net charge-offs of $68 million, or 29 bps, in the third quarter of 2017 and $73 million, or 31 bps, in the fourth quarter of 2016.\nCommercial net charge-offs of $32 million, or 22 bps, increased $2 million sequentially.

Below is a summary of those share repurchases.\nOn December 18, 2017, Fifth Third settled the forward contract related to the August 15, 2017 $990 million share repurchase agreement. An additional 4.3 million shares were repurchased in connection with the completion of this agreement. On December 19, 2017, Fifth Third initially settled a share repurchase agreement whereby Fifth Third would purchase $273 million of its outstanding stock. This reduced fourth quarter common shares outstanding by 7.7 million shares. Settlement of the forward contract related to this agreement is expected to occur on or before March 19, 2018.\nIn total, common shares outstanding decreased by approximately 11.7 million shares in the fourth quarter of 2017 from the third quarter of 2017.\nTax Rate\nAn income tax benefit was recognized in the fourth quarter of 2017. This was a result of the new tax legislation and was primarily due to the remeasurement of deferred tax liabilities at the lower statutory rate. The benefit was partially offset by a tax expense related to a gain on the sale of Vantiv shares sold in the prior quarter. The prior quarter’s tax rate was also impacted by the aforementioned gain on the sale of Vantiv shares. On a full year basis, the 2017 effective rate was 20.8 percent compared with 24.4 percent for the full year of 2016.\nOther\nAs of December 31, 2017, Fifth Third Bank owned approximately 15 million units representing an 8.6 percent interest in Vantiv Holding, LLC, convertible into shares of Vantiv, Inc., a publicly traded firm. Based upon Vantiv’s closing price of $73.55 on December 31, 2017, our interest in Vantiv was valued at approximately $1.1 billion. The difference between the market value and the book value of Fifth Third’s interest in Vantiv’s shares is not recognized in Fifth Third’s equity or capital.\nConference Call\nFifth Third will host a conference call to discuss these financial results at 9:00 a.m. (Eastern Time) today.
