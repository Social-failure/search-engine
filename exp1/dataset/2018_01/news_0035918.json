Pole vault is a dangerous event.”\nBubka agreed with the need to proceed with caution.\n“I think we should be careful with this,” said the Ukrainian, who won six consecutive world athletics titles and four world indoor titles and set a total of 35 world records.\n”This is where we put athletes in danger, put athletes in trouble. Thirty seconds for preparation, specially for outdoor competitions when there can be wind, there can rain, there can be cold, ... this will create some difficulties for the athletes.\n“I can understand that officials are trying to reduce the length of competition but we can try to find other solutions. Referees and judges can be possibly quicker. For the athletes we have to ensure to give them excellent conditions.”\nAthletics has been left to ponder an uncertain future following the retirement of sprint king Usain Bolt of Jamaica last year but Bubka said the sport had always faced the same problem over the years.\n”Usain Bolt was an outstanding athlete,“ Bubka added. ”But in our history we have always had some great, great champions.\n”It’s nice to see what Usain achieved but he retired and that’s life. I am confident with all the work, all the programs over the world it will bring new stars, new champions.\n”There will be another generation. It’s really pleasing to see that Usain is involved in giving back to the sport and in promoting it.\n“I am very confident about the future of athletics.”\nEditing by Peter Rutherford\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-23T11:18:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-23T11:31:47.020+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
