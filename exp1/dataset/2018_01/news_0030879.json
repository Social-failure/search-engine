HOPE FOR RENOVATED BOBSLEIGH TRACK \nWhile the Zetra Olympic Hall in Sarajevo and ski tracks on nearby mountains have been reconstructed and modernised, the Trebevic bobsleigh track, as well as ski jumps and cross-country tracks on the Mountain Igman remain in a state of disrepair. \nAuthorities say their reconstruction would be too expensive and unsustainable. \nBut Senad Omanovic, president of Bosnia’s bobsleigh association and the former Yugoslavia’s two-time champion, believes that a renovated track could be profitable with international teams coming to train there. \n“This track has a great potential,” said Omanovic, who had convinced other sport enthusiasts to join him to clean part of the track to enable juniors from his bobsleigh team to use it for training on the luges on wheels during the warm season. \nThey begun training in 2014 and teams from other European countries, such as Slovakia, Turkey, Poland and Slovenia have also been training on the Trebevic track ahead of the Winter Olympics in Pyeongchang which begin next month. \nWhile Omanovic is optimistic that the track may be opened for practice again, Hana Bajric, 18, finds such hopes unrealistic: “I don’t believe it will ever be reconstructed. There are more urgent things to repair in this country.” Reporting by Daria Sito-Sucic; Editing by Christian Radnedge", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-17T14:44:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-17T14:55:00.185+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
