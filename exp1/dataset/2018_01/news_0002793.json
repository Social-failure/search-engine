One side of the coin has the word “Frankenstein” in the steel-colored center, with the description “The Modern Prometheus” in the yellow outer ring. \nA 50-pence coin will mark a century since the Representation of the People Act of 1918, which first gave women over 30 the right to vote in Britain. Servicemen over 19 and men over 21 also got the right at the same time. \nCoins were minted in 2017 to mark the bicentenary of the death of author Jane Austen and the 1,000th anniversary of the coronation of King Canute. \nThe mint, based in South Wales, traces its history back more than a millennium, to the time when Alfred the Great had his monogram struck on coins in 880.
