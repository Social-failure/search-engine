Those included the 400,000 barrel per day SATORP plant in Jubail, a joint venture with France's Total.\nOPEC agreed to lower production in 2017 and has agreed to maintain output cuts for the whole of 2018 to help bring oil stocks in OECD industrialized countries down to their 5-year average.\n(Reporting by Ron Bousso Editing by Jeremy Gaunt)", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-19T13:50:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-20T03:36:08.003+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
