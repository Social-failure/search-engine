GoPro has a median price target of $8.50.\n“It isn’t clear that they have much of a strategy beyond selling more HERO cameras. I‘m not sure investors will warm up to the story until they demonstrate some traction with sales growth,” Wedbush Securities analyst Michael Pachter said.\nGoPro’s shares closed down 13 percent on Monday, paring the earlier losses after reports that it had hired J.P. Morgan to help it with a sale process.
