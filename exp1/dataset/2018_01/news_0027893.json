We hope to have clarity on the timing by Monday (Jan. 22)”, SodM spokeswoman Cynthia Heijne said on Thursday. \nResponding to the latest earthquake, NAM did not recommend a precise level for future production, saying that decision should be taken by the government. \nBut SodM criticised NAM for being too vague. \nCalculations released by NAM on Thursday showed production theoretically needs to be halved from its present level, to limit risks to a level that the regulator has previously deemed acceptable. \nSodM did not want to react to the NAM calculations, but said they would be taken into account in its decision. \nEconomy Minister Eric Wiebes this week said production will be lowered by “as much as reasonably possible” in the next three years. A detailed proposal will be presented before the end of March, he said. \nThe Dutch government has lowered gas production several times in recent years, as decades of gas extraction have been linked to dozens of earthquakes every year in the Groningen region, causing damage to thousands of buildings and homes.
