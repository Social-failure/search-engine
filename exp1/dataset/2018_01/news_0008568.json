The National Retail Federation expects U.S. holiday sales of as much as $682 billion, nearly 4 percent higher than last year. ( bit.ly/2xW7Oee ) \nLululemon now expects net revenue of $905 million to $915 million for the quarter ending Jan. 28, implying year-over-year growth of 15-16 percent and higher than the forecast of $870 million to $885 million it gave on Dec. 6. \nThe company expects earnings of $1.24 to $1.26 per share, up from its previous forecast of $1.18 to $1.21. It raised its adjusted earnings forecast to between $1.25 and $1.27 per share. \nAnalysts on average were expecting an adjusted profit of $1.22 per share and revenue of $883.8 million, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. \nLululemon’s forecast was based on a 30.4 percent tax rate, and the company said it expects the new U.S. tax laws to be favorable to its effective tax rate in fiscal 2018. \nThe company’s shares rose 3.2 percent to a four-and-a-half year high of $81.92, before reversing course to trade down about 1.2 percent on Monday. \nLululemon will report fourth-quarter results on March 27. \nReporting by Nivedita Bhattacharjee; Editing by Savio D'Souza\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-08T13:48:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-08T13:58:24.008+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
