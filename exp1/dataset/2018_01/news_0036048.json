The five had been missing and presumed dead since a fiery explosion ripped through the site a day earlier. \nThe accident on Monday occurred at a Red Mountain Energy well that was being drilled by contractor Patterson-UTI Energy Inc. Red Mountain Energy is a privately-held oil and gas exploration company based in Oklahoma City. \nIts officials did not respond to requests for further comment. \nThree of Patterson-UTIâ€™s employees were among the victims. Officials have not said who employed the other two. \nThe U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration, U.S. Chemical Safety Board and the Oklahoma Corporation Commission are investigating the accident, Morris said.
