The move came after the conviction of a Pakistani man for spying for Iran in Germany went into force.\nReporting by Michael Nienaber; Editing by Alison Williams\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-16T20:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-16T20:38:27.001+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
