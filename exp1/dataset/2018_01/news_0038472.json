Circling behind the net with the puck, he zipped a pass across the zone to Adam Larsson. Larsson’s shot was stopped by Canucks goalie Jacob Markstrom, but Puljujarvi went to the front of the net and popped in the rebound.\nPuljujarvi also had the primary assist on Leon Draisaitl’s third-period goal which gave the Oilers another two-goal cushion and helped snap Vancouver’s two-game win streak. Maroon capped the scoring with his second of the game late, unassisted for the Oilers.\nTalbot finished with 25 saves for the Oilers, running his record to 17-16-2 on the season. Markstrom had 30 saves for the Canucks, who have played better hockey on the road than at home this season, and is now 12-15-5.\nEdmonton is in the midst of a lengthy homestand, with four more games in their own building upcoming, and host the Buffalo Sabres on Tuesday. The Canucks have a back-to-back ahead, and will face the Jets in Winnipeg on Sunday evening.\n--Field Level Media\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-01-21T14:20:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-22T20:45:03.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
