REUTERS/Kim Kyung-Hoon/File Photo According to the paper, Didi valued 99 at $1 billion, and acquired stakes owned by current shareholders Riverwood Capital, Monashees Inc., Qualcomm Ventures, Tiger Global Management LLC and Softbank Group Corp.\nContacted by Reuters, 99 declined to comment and said it will issue a statement “at an appropriate time”.\nBuyout firms Riverwood and Monashees did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Calls to Tiger Global were not picked up outside business hours.\nThe paper said a $100 million investment announced by Didi in 99 a year ago gave the Chinese company a minority stake in the app.\nThe acquisition intensifies Didi’s global rivalry with Uber, especially in Latin America. Reuters reported on Dec. 7 that Didi plans to enter Mexico this year.\nThe company has made no secret of its desire to expand beyond China, particularly in light of the growing number of Chinese customers who travel overseas. In April, Didi raised $5.5 billion from investors, in part to fund global expansion.\nReporting by Tatiana Bautzer, Gabriela Mello and Gram Slattery; Editing by Adrian Croft\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-03T13:45:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-03T14:06:30.033+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
