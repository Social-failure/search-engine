As athletes we don’t enjoy the moments very long and I want to enjoy this one because it’s very special. \n”I‘m a grand slam champion, and that still seems crazy to say, but I‘m also back to number one. \n“I couldn’t have scripted it any better.” \nAfter two U.S. Open final defeats, many thought Wozniacki might never get another chance to win a grand slam, let alone return to the top of the WTA standings. \n“Lots of ups and downs. But one thing that remained consistent was my fighting spirit and never giving up,” Wozniacki, who now holds the record for length of time between stints at world number one, said. \n“Life sometimes throws curve balls at you and you have to deal with it. Tonight is such a special moment.” \nThe fact that she could share that moment with her father Piotr, her coach since she was seven, added to the occasion. \n“My dad has been there from the start and we took the journey together,” she said. \n“To have him in my corner on a night like tonight, holding the trophy and sharing this means a lot.” \nWozniacki trailed 4-3 in a see-sawing final set in which both players seemed close to exhaustion. \nBut she found some last reserves of energy to reel off three games and leave Halep sucking up a third grand slam final loss. \n“I obviously feel very sad for her, but at the same time I‘m very happy for myself,” she said.
