You’ve got to take the player’s words sometimes, and hopefully he gets through fine, if he gets the opportunity.” \nThe Australia skipper, who has accumulated a series-leading 604 runs at an average of 151, did not name a side but left no one in any doubt that he would be leading it despite missing training on Tuesday because of a bad back. \n“It’s a little bit stiff but nothing I haven’t dealt with before,” Smith said. \n”I’ll have a good hit and a good catch today and I’ll be fine tomorrow. \n“I love batting out here at the SCG, it’s my home ground and I’ve made a few good scores. So hopefully I can continue the run.” \nStarc looks likely to return in place of Jackson Bird, who laboured as a stand-in on an Melbourne Cricket Ground pitch rated as “poor” by the governing International Cricket Council. \nLeft-arm tweaker Ashton Agar was also brought into the squad to offer Australia the option of going with two spinners if it looked like the SCG was going to offer a lot of turn. \nSmith, though, said that it was unlikely that one of the quicks would make way for a second slow bowler in addition to off-spinner Nathan Lyon as the hosts look to wrap up the series 4-0. \n“The wicket’s got a fair bit of grass and looks to be a pretty good wicket,” he added. \n“I’d say we’d probably opt for just the one spinner. Nathan has done a terrific job throughout this series and I’d say we’d go that way.” (Editing by Amlan Chakraborty)", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-03T05:10:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-03T07:50:53.006+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
