Sterling had earlier hit $1.3945, its highest since Britain’s June 2016 vote to leave the European Union. \nSterling, however, remains on track for its longest winning streak against the dollar since 2014, with five straight weeks of gains. \nAgainst the euro sterling was down 0.2 percent on Friday and 0.3 percent weaker versus the yen. \nThe tepid retail sales figures rounds off a week of disappointing data for sterling bulls, including a softening of UK inflation in December. \n“Consumer activity is quite closely correlated to sterling, so retail data is actually something that’s well focused upon in order to gauge sterling direction,” said Mizuho’s head of hedge fund FX sales in London, Neil Jones. \nLong positions on sterling rose to their biggest since the third quarter of 2014 - a complete turnaround from March last year when pessimism over the currency peaked, according to positioning data. FAVOURABLE HEADLINES \nFuelling the optimism about sterling has been a decline in negative headlines about Brexit negotiations in recent weeks, which had been a dampener for sterling bulls for much of 2017. \n“The bigger picture is we have seen some favourable overtures from Europe on Brexit and that is also lifting sentiment,” SSGA’s Graf said. \nThe probability of Britain leaving the EU without a deal has fallen to 20 percent, from 25 percent in December and 30 percent in October, according to a Reuters poll published on Thursday. \nThe president of the European Commission, Jean-Claude Juncker, said on Wednesday Britain was welcome to rejoin the trading bloc after it has left next year. \nStill, Capital Economics said in a research note on Friday that the rise of the pound appeared to have more to do with the weakened dollar than reduced pessimism about Brexit, given sterling had moved far less against the euro. \nDespite the gloom around the retail sector, investors have added to their sterling holdings in recent weeks betting that a steep undervaluation on a trade-weighted basis against its rivals would disappear amid growing appetite for risky assets.
