The Company's power generation projects sell electricity to utilities and other large commercial customers largely under long-term power purchase agreements (\"PPAs\"), which seek to minimize exposure to changes in commodity prices. The aggregate electric generating capacity of this portfolio on a gross ownership basis is approximately 1,793 megawatts (\"MW\"), and on a net ownership basis is approximately 1,440 MW. Eighteen of the projects are currently operational, totaling 1,633 MW on a gross ownership basis and 1,280 MW on a net ownership basis. Four projects, all in Ontario, are not operational, three due to revised contractual arrangements with the offtaker and another, Tunis, has a forward-starting 15-year PPA that will commence with the commercial operation of the plant before June 2019. Eighteen of the power generation projects are majority-owned and directly operated and maintained by the Company.\nAtlantic Power's common shares trade on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol AT and on the Toronto Stock Exchange under the symbol ATP.
