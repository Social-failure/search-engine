Argentum and other generic drug makers have been blocked from launching their own versions of the cancer drug until its expiration date. \nZytiga generated nearly $2.3 billion (£1.66 billion) in sales for Johnson & Johnson in 2016. \nThe drug is also a money-spinner for healthcare group BTG, which earns royalties on sales of a medicine that was originally developed by cancer researchers in Britain. BTG shares fell 5 percent on Thursday on fears for this revenue stream. \nA BTG spokesman said its previous guidance on Zytiga royalties was unchanged and the group maintained that the earliest likely U.S. generic entry would be October 2018.
