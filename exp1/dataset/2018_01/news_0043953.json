Nylander skated down the middle of the ice and lofted a backhander over goaltender Jeff Glass’ blocker for his 10th goal of the season.\nChicago forced overtime when Nick Schmaltz potted his 13th goal on the man advantage at 7:55 of the third period. Schmaltz’s rebound tally from the right post survived a replay review for goaltender interference.\nThe Blackhawks took the lead at 5:29 of the first period with their first power-play goal in 17 chances and six games. Defenseman Brent Seabrook’s one-timer from the right circle deflected off Leo Komarov’s stick and past goaltender Frederik Andersen for his third goal of the season.\nSeabrook was also involved in Toronto’s goal, and not in a good way. Assuming that the linesman would call icing on a puck that Patrick Marleau shot in from behind the center line, Seabrook idly flipped the puck into the corner.\nHowever, the whistle never sounded, and the Maple Leafs generated pressure. The play ended when Jake Gardiner’s shot from the left circle hit Mitchell Marner in the torso and found the net for Marner’s seventh goal of the season at 16:37 of the first period.\nToronto was outshot 17-11 in the opening period but gained a slight territorial advantage in the second with an 11-7 edge in shots on goal.\nThe Maple Leafs grabbed a 2-1 lead at 4:58 of the third period on the power play when Nazem Kadri scored just his second goal in 21 games. Tyler Bozak set him up at the right post, and the unmarked Kadri only had to chip the puck into a half-empty net for his 15th marker of the season.\nAndersen came up with 34 saves in the win. Glass stopped 33 shots.\n--Field Level Media\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-01-25T12:21:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-25T13:16:43.019+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
