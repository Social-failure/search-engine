Penney Co Inc and Macy’s Inc. Shares of Macy‘s, among the biggest victims of the shift to online shopping, fell 2.4 percent. Those of JC Penney were up 1.2 percent, reversing from a drop of nearly 1 percent. \n“Unlike peers JCP and Macy‘s, Kohl’s enjoyed consistent results in both November and December, with traffic in store positive while digital sales came in well ahead of the year-to-date trend,” Gordon Haskett analyst Chuck Grom said. \nThe figures follow a MasterCard Advisors report in late December that showed shoppers spent more than $800 billion in stores and online between Nov. 1 and Dec. 24, a new record. \nSeparately, Canadian sportswear chain Lululemon Athletica Inc said the holiday season was better than it had expected and raised its profit and revenue forecasts for the fourth quarter. \nKohl’s said it now expects fiscal 2017 earnings per share to come in between $4.10 and $4.20, versus its previous forecast of $3.72 to $3.92. \nAnalysts on average were expecting a profit of $3.64, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. \nThe company also said its guidance did not include the impact of recent changes in U.S. corporate taxes, which are expected to benefit its effective tax rate and generate a favorable non-cash tax benefit.
