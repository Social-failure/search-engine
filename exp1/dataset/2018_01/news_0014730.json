BioIVT's eminent and world-renowned SAB members will provide the company with scientific and business insights and help it to identify future growth areas.\n\"During the past year, with our acquisition of Asterand Bioscience and Qualyst Transporter Solutions, BioIVT has evolved from a global biological products provider into a true drug discovery research partner. We now offer a comprehensive range of cell processing, target and biomarker validation, ADME-toxicology, and phenotypic and clinical assay development services, in addition to producing control and disease-state matrices,\" said BioIVT's Chief Scientific Officer Dr. Chris Hansis.\n\"Furthermore, through our BioIVT SAB, we gain access to a group of world-class scientific advisors, who are willing to share their wisdom and further broaden and deepen our areas of drug research and development expertise,\" added Dr. Hansis.\nBioIVT's SAB is chaired by James Rothman, PhD, co-recipient of the 2013 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for his research into how molecular messages are transmitted by human cells. Professor Rothman is the Sterling Professor of Cell Biology and Chair of the Department of Cell Biology, Yale School of Medicine.\nHis fellow SAB members include Professor Amin Rostami, PharmD, PhD, Senior Vice President of Research and Development, and Chief Scientific Officer at Certara. An expert in the use of modeling and simulation to facilitate drug development and enable precision drug dosing for individual patients, Professor Rostami is also Professor of Systems Pharmacology and Co-director of the Centre for Applied Pharmacokinetic Research at the University of Manchester, UK. Professor Rostami has authored/co-authored more than 220 articles. In 2017, he was recognized by ISI as one of the world's most highly-cited researchers in pharmacology and toxicology.\nThey are joined by Binodh DeSilva, PhD, Head of Analytical and Bioanalytical Operations at Bristol-Myers Squibb Company. Dr. DeSilva is well known for helping to set standards for ligand binding assays in the regulated environment. She was President of the American Association of Pharmaceutical Scientists, and a member of the Steering Committee of the Global Bioanalytical Consortium representing North America.
