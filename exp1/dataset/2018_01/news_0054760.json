This week, we kick off the first Federal Reserve meeting of the year. While the odds of an interest rate hike are low, most analysts see three rate hikes this year, with the first expected in March. As rising rates tend to strengthen the dollar's relative value, we may be about to see some strength return.\nVote Vote to see results Total Votes: Not a Scientific Survey.
