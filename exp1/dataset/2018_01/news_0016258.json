The appointment requires approval by parliament. \nAmidu was appointed by Mills as Minister of Justice in January 2012 but was fired only days after his appointment under unclear circumstances. \nHe has since been a critic of the government at the time, now the main opposition party, accusing some of its officials of corruption. \nHe had served as deputy attorney general in the last four years of Ghana’s military government under longtime ruler Jerry Rawlings.
