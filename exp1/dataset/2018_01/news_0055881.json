Sasseigne said ASN’s review of the 12 files has been completed and the reactors have been cleared to restart production.\nHe said EDF had now submitted files for Cruas 2; Paluel 1 and 2; Blayais 2; Cattenom 1; Fessenheim 2 and Tricastin 4 reactors, which are offline or expected to go offline for planned maintenance in the weeks ahead.\nASN had said each reactor would only restart after getting a clearance from the watchdog.\nSasseigne said EDF missed its nuclear production target in 2017 due to warmer-than-expected weather at the end of the year which curbed demand, and due to outages ordered by the country’s ASN nuclear regulator.\nEDF’s nuclear power output was at 379 terrawatt-hours (TWh) during the year, short of a revised target of 383 to 387 TWh.\nPart of the reason for the below-forecast production was because the weather was mild in December, Sasseigne said, adding that January was also expected to be milder than forecast.\nHe said EDF’s cost of nuclear power production was 32 euros ($39.84) a megawatt-hour, including costs for the upgrade of its reactors. The company reports its full 2017 results on Feb. 16.\nThe French Cal‘19 year-ahead power contract traded down 2.35 percent at 39.50 euros/MWh on Tuesday.
