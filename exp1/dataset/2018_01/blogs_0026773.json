More than half (54 percent) did not confront the perpetrator.\n\"There's a stigma of shame, denial and fear of consequences that surrounds these victims, making it often difficult for them to come forward,\" said Rosemary Haefner, chief human resources officer at CareerBuilder.\nCareerBuilder polled 809 full-time, private-sector workers across a variety of industries and company sizes. The survey was conducted Nov. 28 through Dec. 20, in the midst of the #MeToo movement that has emboldened many victims to come forward publicly.\nReasons victims cited for remaining silent included: Fear of being labeled a troublemaker (40 percent), it's their word against the other person (22 percent) and fear of losing their job (18 percent).\nBut of those workers who did report the incident, three-quarters say the issue was resolved.\n\"Unfortunately, history has shown that there were reasons to be concerned,\" Haefner said. \"But we have seen a shift over the last few months ... Anyone who feels harassed should come forward.\"\nWorkers who experience sexual harassment should be able to feel comfortable going to their companies to resolve the situation.\n\"Companies need to do a better job making sure all employees understand that sexual harassment will not be tolerated in the workplace and reports will be taken seriously,\" she said.\nWho has felt sexually harassed in the workplace Age Yes 18-34 17 percent 35-44 11 percent 45-54 10 percent 55 and older 9 percent Source: CareerBuilder According to the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, you should start by telling the person who is doing the harassment to stop — if you feel comfortable doing so. If you don't feel comfortable doing so, or if the behavior continues despite your efforts, there are some key steps to take.\nHere's what you need to know.\nThe law According to the EEOC, sexual harassment is a form of sex discrimination. Under the Civil Rights Act of 1964, you have the legal right to be protected from discrimination in the workplace if your company has 15 or more employees. State laws or employer policies might also offer additional protections.\nWorkplace policies Check to see if your company has an anti-harassment policy. It may be on the employer's web site or in their employee handbook, or you can get it from human resources.\nIf there is a policy in place, follow the steps outlined, which should include options for reporting the incident and filing a complaint.\nWhile the specifics of company policies will differ, federal guidelines say the employer should promptly conduct an impartial investigation, along with ensuring that the harassment stops in the meantime.\nIf the investigation determines harassment did occur, EEOC guidelines say disciplinary measures should be proportional to the seriousness of the offense.\nshow chapters How A.I. is helping boost workplace satisfaction 3:38 AM ET Fri, 12 Jan 2018 | 02:35 Document the harassment Be sure to document the incident in detail, Haefner said.\n\"Make sure you list all the names of people who may have witnessed the incident,\" Haefner said.\nThen, she said, provide your report to a supervisor or manager, or to your human resources department.\nIf your company has no procedure in place for filing a sexual-harassment complaint, you should go to your immediate supervisor. And if that person is the perpetrator?\n\"Make your complaint to your supervisor's immediate supervisor,\" Haefner said.\nIf you don't feel comfortable doing that, consider talking to another manager or supervisor. You should explain what has happened and ask for that person's help in putting a stop to the behavior.\nOther options You have the option of filing a charge of discrimination with the EEOC within either 180 or 300 days of the incident, depending on where you work. (Federal employees and job applicants have a different process and time limits).\nWhile you do not need a lawyer to file a complaint with the federal agency, some victims turn to an employment attorney for help with turning to the EEOC.\nMore from Personal Finance:\nWhat you need to do if you want to put off retirement like Warren Buffett\nThe strong economy could be your ticket to a new job\nGig-job workers had better beware of pay-as-you-go tax payments", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-19T16:59:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-19T17:13:28.006+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
