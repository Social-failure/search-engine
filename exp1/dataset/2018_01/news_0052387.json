I‘m not a sexist. I’ve lived my life right.” \nNeville, 41, has also been criticised for his lack of experience of women’s football, but he said he had coached extensively at a high level. \n“The gap (between the men’s and women’s game) is closing and I would have thought there were not many candidates with my experience of elite players,” he said. \n“I have taken my coaching badges and can’t be more qualified than I am. I am a fast learner.”  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-29T16:05:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-29T16:33:09.004+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
