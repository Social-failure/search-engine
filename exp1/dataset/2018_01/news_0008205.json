(NASDAQ:NEOT) today announced that the Special Meeting of Stockholders held earlier today was convened and adjourned without any business being conducted other than the adjournment. The meeting will reconvene on Wednesday, January 17, 2018 at 8:00 a.m., local time, at the same location, 4365 Executive Drive, Suite 1100, San Diego, CA 92121. The record date for stockholders entitled to vote at the special meeting will remain December 13, 2017.\nThe adjournment will allow for the solicitation of additional votes on the proposals contained in Neothetics’ proxy statement/prospectus/information statement. While the merger with Evofem Biosciences, the reverse split, the name change, the opt out of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law and the issuance of the shares in the concurrent financing are all exceeding 98% approval based on votes cast to date, approval of more than 50% of all outstanding shares of Neothetics common stock is necessary to obtain a quorum and for the merger to go forward. At the meeting, it was deemed that the holders of a sufficient number of the Neothetics’ outstanding common stock have not yet submitted proxies to indicate how their shares should be voted and additional time was needed to collect the required votes.\nDuring the period of the adjournment, Neothetics will continue to solicit proxies from its stockholders of record as of December 13, 2017. Neothetics has retained a proxy solicitor, Kingsdale Shareholder Services, to increase the outreach to a larger number of stockholders. Stockholders who have already voted do not need to recast their votes.\nNeothetics stockholders should note that the merger proposal (Proposal 1), the reverse stock split proposal (Proposal 2), the name change proposal (Proposal 3), the Section 203 opt out proposal (Proposal 4) and the financing proposal (Proposal 5) must all be approved for the merger to be completed. If any of those proposals is not approved, the merger will not go forward. Failure to vote or an abstention from voting will have the same effect as a vote “AGAINST” the merger and related proposals. All stockholders are asked to vote “FOR” all proposals now. If you previously voted against any of these proposals and would now like to change your vote, you can do so by contacting Kingsdale Shareholder Service, Neothetics’ transfer agent.\nHow to Vote\nIf you are a Neothetics stockholder and you have questions or require assistance in submitting your proxy or voting your shares, please contact Neothetics’ transfer agent or proxy solicitor:\nPHILADELPHIA STOCK TRANSFER\n(866) 223-0448 (toll free)\n(484) 416-3124 (collect)\nKingsdale Shareholder Services\n(866) 851-3214 (toll free)\nIn addition, Neothetics’ proxy solicitor may contact stockholders on behalf of the Company.
