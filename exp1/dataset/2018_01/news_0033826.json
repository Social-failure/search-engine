After accepting the award, writer-director Samuel Maoz said: “If I criticize the place I live, I do it because I worry. I do it because I want to protect it. I do it from love.” Writing by Jeffrey Heller; Additional reporting by Dan Williams; Editing by Kevin Liffey", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-23T19:01:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-23T19:11:44.003+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
