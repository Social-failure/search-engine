The welfare of the players is paramount.” \nWith balls lifting sharply off a good length all day, the umpires discussed player safety on at least four occasions before finally halting proceedings when South Africa opener Dean Elgar was struck on the helmet by a short ball from seamer Jasprit Bumrah. \nThe home side were 17 for one at the close, with Elgar 11 not out and Hashim Amla at the other end on two, still needing 224 for victory in their second innings. \nIndia might feel aggrieved to have lost 20 minutes at the end of day after their own batsmen took body blows all through their second innings.

REUTERS/James Oatway \nThe tourists had earlier showed admirable bravery in posting 247 in their second innings. \nAjinkya Rahane (48), not picked for the first two tests of the series, played some sublime shots and said the game should continue. Slideshow (3 Images) \n“Our approach is that we want to play and we want to win this test match,” Rahane told reporters. \n”That ball (to Elgar) was back of length, a hard length. It kicked off with slightly more bounce than usual. \n“The bounce on this wicket is completely natural. Not dangerous, it is completely similar for both teams.” \nSouth Africa coach Ottis Gibson says his team also wants to complete the test. \n“We are here to play cricket. We still want to play cricket,” Gibson said. “Throughout the whole game on both sides, you saw batsmen wearing a few. India didn’t complain and we didn’t either.” \nSouth Africa have an unassailable 2-0 lead in the three-match series, but are seeking a first ever clean-sweep over India.
