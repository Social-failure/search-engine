Judicial sources said an initial investigation suggested that negligence could have contributed to the crash. \nA South African man died and an Argentinian and two French tourists were being treated in hospital. A number of other tourists were also taken to Luxor International Hospital but released after a few hours. \nLuxor, a city surrounded by ancient tombs and other historic sites, is one of the main focuses of Egypt’s tourism industry - a key revenue-earner that the government has been trying to revive after years of political turmoil. \nNineteen people, most of them Asian and European tourists, died near Luxor in 2013 when a hot air balloon caught fire and crashed after a mid-air gas explosion.
