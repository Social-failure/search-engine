The student then shot the principal on campus, local police chief Zahoor Afridi told Reuters. \nHe said the unnamed student had attended a sit-in staged by a new ultra-religious political party, Tehreek-e-Labaik, late last year to oppose a small change in wording to an electoral law, which it said amounted to blasphemy. \nThe protest, which brought the capital Islamabad to a standstill, ended in clashes between police and demonstrators that killed seven people and injured over 200. It also led the government to back down and accept the resignation of a minister accused of blasphemy. \n“Obviously now he is going to say that he (the principal) committed blasphemy. This is a very unfortunate incident,” Afridi added. \nInsulting Islam’s prophet is punishable by death under Pakistani law, and blasphemy accusations stir such emotions that they are difficult to defend against. Even a rumor of blasphemy can spark mob violence. \nPolice have taken the student, who appeared in photographs and video to be 16 or 17 years old, into custody and filed a first information report against him. \nIn a video recorded during the arrest, the student can be heard defending his actions in Pashto, a regional language. \n“I committed this murder and I accepted it. It was ordered by God,” he proclaimed. \nThere was widespread outrage across Pakistan last April when student Mashal Khan was beaten to death at his university in Mardan following a dormitory debate about religion. \nPolice arrested 57 people, including students and some faculty members, in connection with the killing. \nThere have been at least 67 murders over unproven allegations of blasphemy since 1990, according to figures from a research center and independent records kept by Reuters. \nIn 2011, a bodyguard assassinated Punjab provincial governor Salman Taseer after he called for the blasphemy laws to be reformed. Taseer’s killer, executed last year, has been hailed as a martyr by religious hardliners.
