Syrian Kurdish officials have pledged to meet any wider Turkish assault with an “appropriate response”.\nTurkish President Tayyip Erdogan greets his supporters during a meeting of the ruling AK Party in Corum, Turkey January 28, 2018. Yasin Bulbul/Presidential Palace/Handout via REUTERS More than a week into their offensive, however, Turkey and allied Syrian rebel groups have made only modest progress fighting into hilly terrain against entrenched foes.\nThe U.S.-backed Syrian Democratic Forces, an alliance of militias of which the YPG is the strongest, had said earlier on Sunday that there was intense fighting in the area.\nA war monitor, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, said Turkey and its allied rebel groups had taken the hill, which overlooks the major Syrian town of Azaz, which they also hold.\nThe Observatory said Turkish air strikes had killed three people in one family early on Sunday in Afrin. Turkish bombardment also damaged an ancient temple, it said.\nReporting by Tuvan Gumrukcu; Editing by Raissa Kasolowsky\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-28T16:07:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-28T16:33:15.019+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
