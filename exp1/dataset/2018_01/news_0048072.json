I know I forgot to say that after the match,” a bleary-eyed Federer told reporters on Monday. “But I hope I come back again next year.”\nFederer equaled the record of six Australian Open men’s titles, held by Novak Djokovic and Roy Emerson, and emulated Ken Rosewall’s feat of claiming three grand slam titles after the age of 35.\nHis longevity has in part been put down to the careful management of his playing schedule.\nDespite being fully fit, he skipped the entire claycourt season last year to concentrate on Wimbledon, a decision that paid off with his eighth title on the southwest London grass courts.\nHe reiterated on Monday that he would continue to manage his schedule tightly and despite being within sight of the world’s top ranking, a decision on whether or not his next tournament would be in Dubai in late February had yet to be made.\n“We were in talks with them (Dubai organizers) but when the (Australian Open) tournament started, I just said ‘look, if it’s okay, I’d like to decide after the tournament’,” he said.\n”That’s an ideal scenario for me. After the tournament, I’ll know how I feel... did I come out injured or not?\nTennis - Australian Open - Melbourne, Australia, January 29, 2018.

I can’t believe that I was able to defend my title, that after all these years I could do it again.\n“It’s super special, one of the great moments in my career, and maybe this one is going to take longer to sink in.”\nReporting by Greg Stutchbury in Wellington; Editing by John O'Brien\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-29T06:32:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-29T06:51:40.006+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
