The total for 2017 was up 8.5 percent from the previous year at 10.51 million tonnes.\nDiesel exports rose 12 percent in December from the same month a year earlier to 1.99 million tonnes, just shy of November’s record of 2.026 million. 2017 exports were up also 12 percent at 17.19 million tonnes.\nChina’s total exports of refined fuel touched an all-time monthly high of 6.17 million tonnes in December, spurred by generous government quotas granted to state oil firms to ship the surplus fuel.\nReporting by Josephine Mason; Editing by Kenneth Maxwell\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-01-23T12:21:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-23T18:04:05.038+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
