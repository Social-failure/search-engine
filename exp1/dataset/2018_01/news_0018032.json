It is absolutely not possible for this to be accepted.”\nTurkey considers the YPG to be an extension of the outlawed Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK), which has waged an insurgency in southeast Turkey since the 1980s. Ankara “will continue its fight against any terrorist organisation regardless of its name and shape within and outside its borders”, Kalin said.\nReporting by Orhan Coskun; Writing by Dominic Evans; Editing by Kevin Liffey\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-01-15T00:24:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-14T20:22:07.015+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
