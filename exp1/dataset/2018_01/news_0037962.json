I have mixed emotions, all good emotions,” Mertens said on court, the smile still fixed on her face. \n“I gave it all today, it was a little stressy at the end. I played my game and it went well.” \nThe first Belgian woman to make the semi-finals in Melbourne since her mentor Kim Clijsters in 2012, Mertens will next meet Caroline Wozniacki or Carla Suarez Navarro.

REUTERS/Thomas Peter \nFor Svitolina, who said she had been struggling with the hip injury since winning the Brisbane International warm-up, it was a third grand slam quarter-final defeat in three attempts after her two previous disappointments at the French Open. \nGiven the Ukrainian’s renowned mobility, Mertens was well aware that she would have to go for her shots if she was to win and she did just that to break for 2-1 at the start of the opening set with a thumping backhand return. Slideshow (3 Images) \nA second break for 5-2 put Svitolina firmly on the back foot but the world number four finally exerted some pressure and got one of the breaks back when Mertens double faulted while serving for the set. \nThat could have been a turning point but Mertens regathered herself and served out at the second attempt when Svitolina miscued a forehand after 41 minutes. \n“I knew it was going to be tough, I tried to be aggressive, make her move, come to the net a bit more, just try to play aggressive in the court,” Mertens added. \nMertens was now oozing with confidence and an overhead volley at the net saw her break in the first game of the second set before she romped away for a handsome victory. \n“She’s a great player (and) I couldn’t match it, because physically it was very tough for me,” Svitolina said. \n“Going into the tournament, I had a few issues with my health. She didn’t give me opportunities. All the credit to her, because she played really good tennis and was only today, so I couldn’t really match it.” Reporting by Nick Mulvenney in Sydney, editing by Peter Rutherford", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-23T05:31:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-23T05:54:05.028+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
