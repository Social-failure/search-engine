Interest income was up $13.4 million from an increase in non-acquired loan interest income of $2.5 million during the fourth quarter, and from an increase of $10.1 million from acquired loan interest income due to the merger with PSTB and the addition of their $2.3 billion loan portfolio. In addition, investment securities income increased by $746,000 due primarily to the addition of the PSTB securities portfolio. Interest expense increased by $1.5 million, with $887,000 attributable to certificate and other time deposits, $373,000 increase in transaction and money market accounts and $164,000 increase in other borrowings. These increases were primarily related to the merger with PSTB. The Company paid off all the FHLB advances and other senior and subordinated debt assumed from Park Sterling totaling $304.0 million (retained $40.0 million of Trust Preferred Debt). Our funding cost was 0.29% for the fourth quarter of 2017, an increase of 0.05% from the third quarter of 2017. Compared to the fourth quarter of 2016, our cost of funds increased by 0.14% which is primarily the result of the addition of the Southeastern and the Park Sterling merger where both entities cost of funds was higher than legacy South State’s. The total provision for loan losses increased $1.7 million compared to the third quarter of 2017. Valuation allowance (impairment) related to acquired loans was $1.1 million higher than third quarter of 2017, as multiple pools had impairments. The provision for loan losses related to acquired non-credit impaired loans was higher by $406,000, as the third quarter of 2017 was a net recovery, and the provision for loan losses on non-acquired loans was $233,000 higher than last quarter primarily related to loan growth, including PSTB. Noninterest income increased by $3.1 million from fees on deposit accounts, recoveries on acquired loans, trust and investment services income, and mortgage banking income. Noninterest expense increased by $23.0 million, with $16.1 million from merger expenses and salaries and employee benefits of $3.5 million being the two largest increases. The increase was the result of our merger with PSTB during the quarter.\nIncome Tax Expense\nDuring the quarter, our effective income tax rate increased to 94.36% from 33.53% in the third quarter of 2017. The year-to-date (YTD) effective income tax rate was 48.13% compared to 34.25% in 2016. On December 22, 2017, the Tax Act was signed into law and resulted in the Company revaluing its net deferred tax asset downward by an estimated $26.6 million resulting in the large increase in the effective rate for 2017. Without this revaluation impact, the Company’s effective tax rate would have been 32.40% for 2017. This decline was primarily related to: (1) excess tax benefit associated with vested or exercised nonqualified stock options included in determination of the effective tax rate during the year and (2) an increase in tax-exempt income from bank owned life insurance (BOLI) policies, loans and securities.\n“South State completed two acquisitions, crossed the $10 billion regulatory threshold and reported strong financial results in 2017. Assets total over $14 billion and we serve over 700,000 customers in markets from Virginia to Georgia,” said Robert R. Hill, Jr., CEO of South State Corporation. “We look forward to 2018 and are excited about the prospects for continued growth.”\nBalance Sheet and Capital\nEnding Balance Dec. 31, Sept. 30, June 30, Mar. 31, Dec. 31, BALANCE SHEET 2017 2017 2017 2017 2016 Assets Cash and cash equivalents $ 377,627 $ 403,934 $ 431,890 $ 663,126 $ 374,448 Investment securities: Securities held to maturity 2,529 3,678 4,166 6,095 6,094 Securities available for sale, at fair value 1,650,710 1,320,679 1,341,652 1,381,013 999,405 Other investments 20,530 12,439 13,076 13,501 9,482 Total investment securities 1,673,769 1,336,796 1,358,894 1,400,609 1,014,981 Loans held for sale 70,890 46,321 65,995 46,988 50,572 Loans: Acquired credit impaired 618,803 578,863 602,481 627,340 602,546 Acquired non-credit impaired 3,507,907 1,455,555 1,585,981 1,715,642 836,699 Non-acquired 6,492,155 6,230,327 5,992,393 5,564,307 5,241,041 Less allowance for non-acquired loan losses (43,448 ) (41,541 ) (40,149 ) (38,449 ) (36,960 ) Loans, net 10,575,417 8,223,204 8,140,706 7,868,840 6,643,326 Other real estate owned (\"OREO\") 11,203 13,527 14,430 20,007 18,316 Premises and equipment, net 255,565 198,146 201,539 203,505 183,510 Bank owned life insurance 225,132 151,402 150,476 149,562 104,148 Deferred tax asset 45,902 41,664 39,921 43,075 31,123 Mortgage servicing rights 31,119 29,937 29,930 30,063 29,037 Core deposit and other intangibles 73,789 50,472 52,966 55,461 39,848 Goodwill 999,586 597,236 595,817 595,711 338,340 Other assets 126,590 76,471 71,877 73,123 72,943 Total assets $ 14,466,589 $ 11,169,110 $ 11,154,441 $ 11,150,070 $ 8,900,592 Liabilities and Shareholders' Equity Deposits: Noninterest-bearing $ 3,047,432 $ 2,505,570 $ 2,635,147 $ 2,599,111 $ 2,199,046 Interest-bearing 8,485,334 6,556,451 6,396,507 6,434,327 5,135,377 Total deposits 11,532,766 9,062,021 9,031,654 9,033,438 7,334,423 Federal funds purchased and securities sold under agreements to repurchase\n286,857 291,099 334,018 352,431 313,773 Other borrowings 216,385 83,307 98,147 107,988 55,358 Other liabilities 121,661 99,858 85,137 76,313 62,450 Total liabilities 12,157,669 9,536,285 9,548,956 9,570,170 7,766,004 Shareholders' equity: Preferred stock - $.01 par value; authorized 10,000,000 shares -- -- -- -- -- Common stock - $2.50 par value; authorized 80,000,000 shares 91,899 73,168 73,148 73,077 60,576 Surplus 1,807,601 1,136,352 1,134,328 1,132,173 711,307 Retained earnings 419,847 427,093 401,706 379,534 370,916 Accumulated other comprehensive loss (10,427 ) (3,788 ) (3,697 ) (4,884 ) (8,211 ) Total shareholders' equity 2,308,920 1,632,825 1,605,485 1,579,900 1,134,588 Total liabilities and shareholders' equity $ 14,466,589 $ 11,169,110 $ 11,154,441 $ 11,150,070 $ 8,900,592 Common shares issued and outstanding 36,759,656 29,267,369 29,259,264 29,230,734 24,230,392 At December 31, 2017, the Company’s total assets were $14.5 billion, an increase of $3.3 billion from September 30, 2017, and an increase of $5.6 billion, or 62.5% from December 31, 2016.

Acquired loans declined by approximately $121.3 million, excluding Park Sterling. Total deposits increased $2.5 billion from September 30, 2017, with $2.4 billion coming from the merger with Park Sterling. Without the impact of Park Sterling, deposits increased $47.4 million, or 2.1%, during the fourth quarter of 2017. Fed funds purchased and securities sold under repurchase agreements decreased by $4.2 million during the fourth quarter to $286.9 million. Other borrowings increased by $133.1 million during the fourth quarter of 2017 compared to the third quarter of 2017. This increase was the result of trust preferred debt assumed from PSTB totaling $40.9 million plus FHLB advances of $100.0 million in December, offset by FHLB advances that were repaid of approximately $9.0 million in October 2017.\nThe Company’s book value per common share increased to $62.81 per share at December 31, 2017, compared to $55.79 at September 30, 2017 and $46.82 at December 31, 2016. The increase in capital during the fourth quarter of 2017 was related to the merger with PSTB and added $688.7 million in equity. During 2017, book value increased by $15.99 per share which included the impact of both the merger with SBFC and PSTB. The Company’s outstanding shares increased by 12.5 million primarily from the two mergers (5.0 million related to SBFC and 7.5 million related to PSTB) in 2017. Accumulated other comprehensive income (“AOCI”) decreased $6.6 million due primarily to an unrealized loss in the AFS securities portfolio, during the fourth quarter of 2017, of $6.5 million, net of tax. Tangible book value (“TBV”) per common share decreased by $0.05 per share to $33.61 at December 31, 2017, compared to $33.66 at September 30, 2017, and increased by $2.39 per share, or 7.7%, from $31.22 at December 31, 2016. The quarterly decrease of $0.05 per share in tangible book value was primarily the result of (1) earnings per share, excluding amortization of intangibles, of $0.12, offset by the dividend paid to shareholders of $0.33 per share; (2) a decrease in AOCI (see above) of $0.18 per share; offset by (3) the exercise of stock options and issuance of stock related to employee stock purchase plan which increased tangible book value by $0.03 per share. The decrease in tangible book value per share also reflects the additional 7.5 million shares issued in the PSTB merger and the increase in capital reduced by goodwill and amortizing intangible asset (CDI).\n“Despite the impact of two mergers and the revaluation of our deferred tax assets during 2017, our tangible book value per share improved by $2.39, or 7.7% to $33.61 per share,” said John C. Pollok, COO and CFO. “In addition, total risk based capital was estimated to equal 13.0%, and tangible common equity to tangible assets was 9.23%.”\nThree Months Ended Twelve Months Ended Dec. 31, Sept. 30, June 30, Mar. 31, Dec. 31, Dec. 31, Dec. 31, PERFORMANCE RATIOS 2017 2017 2017 2017 2016 2017 2016 Return on average assets (annualized) 0.08 % 1.25 % 1.15 % 0.68 % 1.08 % 0.77 % 1.16 % Adjusted return on average assets (annualized) (non-GAAP) (3) 1.33 % 1.28 % 1.25 % 1.25 % 1.26 % 1.28 % 1.26 % Return on average equity (annualized) 0.51 % 8.57 % 7.98 % 4.74 % 8.50 % 5.26 % 9.17 % Adjusted return on average equity (annualized) (non-GAAP) (3) 8.75 % 8.73 % 8.69 % 8.67 % 9.84 % 8.71 % 9.97 % Return on average tangible common equity (annualized) (non-GAAP) (7) 1.59 % 14.93 % 14.16 % 8.87 % 13.42 % 9.63 % 14.72 % Adjusted return on average tangible common equity (annualized) (non-GAAP) (3) (7) 15.83 % 15.21 % 15.34 % 15.55 % 15.44 % 15.49 % 15.94 % Efficiency ratio (tax equivalent) 68.50 % 59.48 % 62.80 % 77.51 % 65.82 % 67.07 % 64.16 % Adjusted efficiency ratio (non-GAAP) (9) 56.96 % 58.35 % 59.67 % 61.95 % 61.59 % 59.16 % 62.89 % Dividend payout ratio (2) 399.30 % 27.56 % 30.33 % 52.82 % 32.06 % 44.11 % 28.91 % Book value per common share $ 62.81 $ 55.79 $ 54.87 $ 54.05 $ 46.82 Tangible common equity per common share (non-GAAP) (7) $ 33.61 $ 33.66 $ 32.70 $ 31.77 $ 31.22 CAPITAL RATIOS Equity-to-assets 15.96 % 14.62 % 14.39 % 14.17 % 12.75 % Tangible equity-to-tangible assets (non-GAAP) (7) 9.23 % 9.36 % 9.11 % 8.85 % 8.88 % Tier 1 common equity (6) 11.5 % 12.1 % 11.9 % 11.9 % 11.7 % Tier 1 leverage (6) 10.3 % 10.3 % 10.1 % 10.0 % 9.9 % Tier 1 risk-based capital (6) 12.6 % 12.9 % 12.8 % 12.8 % 12.4 % Total risk-based capital (6) 13.0 % 13.5 % 13.3 % 13.3 % 13.0 % OTHER DATA Number of branches 182 129 129 129 118 Number of employees (full-time equivalent basis) 2,719 2,255 2,261 2,277 2,055 Asset Quality\nEnding Balance Dec. 31, Sept. 30, June 30, Mar. 31, Dec. 31, (Dollars in thousands) 2017 2017 2017 2017 2016 NONPERFORMING ASSETS: Non-acquired Non-acquired nonperforming loans $ 14,831 $ 12,896 $ 13,499 $ 13,035 $ 14,745 Non-acquired OREO and other nonperforming assets 2,536 6,330 4,633 5,705 3,998 Total non-acquired nonperforming assets 17,367 19,226 18,132 18,740 18,743 Acquired Acquired nonperforming loans\n9,447 6,401 5,793 4,950 4,834 Acquired OREO and other nonperforming assets 9,263 7,846 10,439 14,992 15,026 Total acquired nonperforming assets 18,710 14,247 16,232 19,942 19,860 Total nonperforming assets $ 36,077 $ 33,473 $ 34,364 $ 38,682 $ 38,603 Three Months Ended Twelve Months Ended Dec. 31, Sept. 30, June 30, Mar. 31, Dec. 30, Dec. 31, Dec. 30, 2017 2017 2017 2017 2016 2017 2016 ASSET QUALITY RATIOS: Allowance for non-acquired loan losses as a percentage of non-acquired loans (1)\n0.67 % 0.67 % 0.67 % 0.69 % 0.71 % 0.67 % 0.71 % Allowance for non-acquired loan losses as a percentage of non-acquired nonperforming loans\n292.95 % 322.12 % 297.42 % 294.97 % 250.66 % 292.95 % 250.66 % Net charge-offs on non-acquired loans as a percentage of average non-acquired loans (annualized) (1)\n0.02 % 0.04 % 0.05 % 0.05 % 0.05 % 0.04 % 0.06 % Net charge-offs on acquired non-credit impaired loans as a percentage of average acquired non-credit impaired loans (annualized) (1)\n0.07 % 0.00 % 0.10 % 0.08 % 0.06 % 0.07 % 0.07 % Total nonperforming assets as a percentage of total assets\n0.25 % 0.30 % 0.31 % 0.35 % 0.43 % Excluding Acquired Assets NPLs as a percentage of period end non-acquired loans (1) 0.23 % 0.21 % 0.23 % 0.23 % 0.28 % Total nonperforming assets as a percentage of total non-acquired loans and repossessed assets (1) (4)\n0.27 % 0.31 % 0.30 % 0.34 % 0.36 % Total nonperforming assets as a percentage of total assets (5)\n0.12 % 0.17 % 0.16 % 0.17 % 0.21 % During the fourth quarter of 2017, overall asset quality remained strong and total nonperforming assets totaled $36.1 million, representing 0.25% of total assets, which is a decline of 5 basis points from the third quarter of 2017 and 18 basis points from December 31, 2016. NPAs increased by $2.6 million in the fourth quarter of 2017, primarily related to acquired non-credit impaired loans and acquired OREO, with the merger of PSTB. Compared to December 31, 2016, NPAs have declined by $2.5 million, or 6.5%. During the fourth quarter of 2017, non-acquired NPAs, excluding acquired loans and acquired OREO, declined by $1.9 million to $17.4 million. This was the result of a $3.8 million decrease in non-acquired OREO and other nonperforming assets owned, partially offset by $1.9 million increase in non-acquired nonperforming loans for the quarter.\nDuring the fourth quarter, the Company reported $9.4 million in nonperforming loans related to “acquired non-credit impaired loans.” This was an increase of $3.0 million from the balance at September 30, 2017, which was primarily the result of the merger with PSTB. Additionally, acquired nonperforming OREO and other assets owned increased by $1.4 million from September 30, 2017 and declined by $5.8 million from December 31, 2016.\nAt December 31, 2017, the allowance for non-acquired loan losses was $43.4 million, or 0.67%, of non-acquired period-end loans and $41.5 million, or 0.67%, at September 30, 2017, and down from 0.71% when the ALLL was $37.0 million at December 31, 2016. The current allowance for loan losses provides 2.93 times coverage of period-end non-acquired nonperforming loans, down from 3.22 times at September 30, 2017, and 2.51 times at December 31, 2016. Net charge-offs within the non-acquired portfolio were $265,000, or 0.02% annualized, in the fourth quarter of 2017, compared to $547,000 for the third quarter of 2017, or 0.04% annualized. Fourth quarter 2016 net charge-offs totaled $644,000, or 0.05% annualized. The net charge-offs currently being experienced were primarily from overdraft and ready reserve accounts within the loan portfolio. During the fourth quarter of 2017, the provision for non-acquired loan losses totaled $2.2 million compared to $1.9 million in the third quarter of 2017, and $284,000 in the fourth quarter of 2016. The increase in the non-acquired provision for loan losses in the fourth quarter of 2017 compared to the third quarter of 2017 resulted primarily from the risk and uncertainties in new and expanded markets resulting from the merger with PSTB. For 2017 and 2016, the Company experienced 0.04% and 0.06%, respectively, in annual net charge offs, or $2.2 million and $2.7 million, respectively.\nNet charge offs (recoveries) related to “acquired non-credit impaired loans” were $402,000, or 0.07% annualized, in the fourth quarter of 2017. The Company recorded a provision for loan losses, accordingly, during the fourth quarter of 2017. Net charge-offs increased by $406,000, as the third quarter the Company reported ($4,000) in net recoveries. In the fourth quarter of 2016, net charge-offs totaled $122,000, or 0.06% annualized. For 2017 and 2016, the Company experienced 0.07% in annual net charge offs of acquired non-credit impaired loans.\nThe Company recorded net impairment within certain acquired credit impaired loan pools across many of the acquired portfolios during the fourth quarter of 2017. The net impact, which increased the valuation allowance, totaled $1.2 million compared to $127,000 increase in the third quarter of 2017.\nTotal OREO decreased to $11.2 million at December 31, 2017, down from $13.5 million at September 30, 2017. This decrease was the result of the disposition of 27 properties of both acquired and non-acquired OREO. Partially offsetting the decline was the addition of OREO from the merger with PSTB which added $2.1 million in OREO and the addition of transfers in of OREO during the quarter.\nNet Interest Income and Margin\nThree Months Ended December 31, 2017 September 30, 2017 December 31, 2016 (Dollars in thousands) Average Income/ Yield/ Average Income/ Yield/ Average Income/ Yield/ YIELD ANALYSIS Balance Expense Rate Balance Expense Rate Balance Expense Rate Interest-Earning Assets: Federal funds sold, reverse repo, and time deposits $ 216,386 $ 793 1.45 % $ 169,511 $ 581 1.36 % $ 330,571 $ 619 0.74 % Investment securities (taxable) 1,256,347 7,269 2.30 % 1,169,451 6,646 2.25 % 850,546 4,446 2.08 % Investment securities (tax-exempt) 202,480 1,443 2.83 % 186,108 1,320 2.81 % 112,888 914 3.22 % Loans held for sale 39,586 347 3.48 % 52,609 503 3.79 % 51,383 414 3.21 % Loans 9,082,330 107,972 4.72 % 8,227,544 95,361 4.60 % 6,581,678 76,295 4.61 % Total interest-earning assets 10,797,129 117,824 4.33 % 9,805,223 104,411 4.22 % 7,927,066 82,688 4.15 % Noninterest-earning assets 1,547,237 1,306,130 942,480 Total Assets $ 12,344,366 $ 11,111,353 $ 8,869,546 Interest-Bearing Liabilities: Transaction and money market accounts $ 4,523,525 $ 1,443 0.13 % $ 3,940,519 $ 1,070 0.11 % $ 3,398,091 $ 654 0.08 % Savings deposits 1,388,183 508 0.15 % 1,373,301 522 0.15 % 796,747 121 0.06 % Certificates and other time deposits 1,319,107 2,269 0.68 % 1,058,812 1,382 0.52 % 896,820 648 0.29 % Federal funds purchased and repurchase agreements 307,079 324 0.42 % 307,730 276 0.36 % 321,168 156 0.19 % Other borrowings 102,309 1,006 3.90 % 92,951 842 3.59 % 55,328 509 3.66 % Total interest-bearing liabilities 7,640,203 5,550 0.29 % 6,773,313 4,092 0.24 % 5,468,154 2,088 0.15 % Noninterest-bearing liabilities 2,827,699 2,715,089 2,269,588 Shareholders' equity 1,876,464 1,622,951 1,131,804 Total Non-IBL and shareholders' equity 4,704,163 4,338,040 3,401,392 Total liabilities and shareholders' equity $ 12,344,366 $ 11,111,353 $ 8,869,546 Net interest income and margin (NON-TAX EQUIV.) $ 112,274 4.13 % $\n100,319\n4.06 % $ 80,600 4.04 % Net interest margin (TAX EQUIVALENT) 4.18 % 4.11 % 4.09 % Overall Cost of Funds (including demand deposits) 0.21 % 0.17 % 0.11 % Non-taxable equivalent net interest income was $112.3 million for the fourth quarter of 2017, a $12.0 million increase from the third quarter of 2017, resulting primarily from the addition of acquired loans from the merger with PSTB. The highlights are below:\n1. Average balance of non-acquired loans increased by approximately $218.1 million and resulted in non-acquired loan interest income of $62.6 million, a $2.5 million increase from the third quarter of 2017. The yield on total non-acquired loans was 3.91% up from 3.89% in the third quarter of 2017.\n2. Acquired loan interest income increased $10.1 million from the third quarter of 2017, to $45.4 million. The yield on acquired loans for the fourth quarter of 2017 (including the merger with PSTB) was 6.57% and decreased from 6.65% in the third quarter of 2017, and the average balance increased by $636.7 million in the fourth quarter of 2017. The decline in the acquired loan yield was primarily the result of the payoffs of acquired loans during the quarter. Any future decline in the acquired loan yield will be primarily dependent upon the level of loan pay downs and pay-offs each quarter within the acquired loan portfolio. The fourth quarter of 2017 total loan yield (including PSTB) was 4.72% up from 4.60% in the third quarter of 2017 and from 4.61% in the fourth quarter of 2016;\n3. The investment securities portfolio increased by $337.0 million, net with the merger of PSTB, and the average balance increased $103.3 million, compared to the third quarter of 2017. Subsequent to the merger, the Company sold approximately $90.0 million of the securities portfolio acquired from PSTB. This resulted in $746,000 in additional securities interest income in the fourth quarter compared to the third quarter of 2017, and at a slightly higher yield; and\n4. Interest expense increased by $1.5 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 compared to the third quarter of 2017. This increase was within most categories of funding, except savings deposits, from the merger with PSTB and the increase in interest rates on certificate and other time deposits. Total cost of funds on interest-bearing liabilities was 29 basis points, an increase of 5 basis points from the third quarter of 2017 and up 14 basis points from the fourth quarter of 2016. The merger with Park Sterling resulted in an increase in the Company’s interest-bearing liabilities of approximately $866.9 million for the fourth quarter of 2017. The overall funding cost of PSTB was higher than legacy South State’s cost of funds.\nTax-equivalent net interest margin improved 7 basis points from the third quarter of 2017 and improved by 9 basis points from the fourth quarter of 2016. The yield /cost on all asset categories and all funding categories increased, except savings deposits. During the fourth quarter of 2017, the Company’s average total assets increased to $12.3 billion from $11.1 billion at September 30, 2017 and from $8.9 billion at December 31, 2016. Average earning assets totaled $10.8 billion up $991.9 million compared to the third quarter of 2017. Average interest-bearing liabilities totaled $7.6 billion for the fourth quarter of 2017 up from $6.8 billion at the end of the third quarter of 2017, and up from $5.5 billion at December 31, 2016. Average non-interest bearing demand deposits increased by $112.6 million during the fourth quarter of 2017 from the merger with PSTB; and increased by $558.1 million from December 31, 2016, due primarily to the mergers with SBFC and PSTB. Including the impact of noninterest bearing deposits, the Company’s cost of funds was 21 basis points for the fourth quarter of 2017 compared to 17 basis points in the third quarter of 2017, and compared to 11 basis points in the fourth quarter of 2016.\nAccretable Yield Rollforward (Acquired credit impaired loans)\nDecember 31, 2017 Dec. 31, Sept. 30, June 30, Mar. 31, Dec. 31, (Dollars in thousands)\n2017 2017 2017 2017 2016 Balance at beginning of period $ 132,575 $ 139,283 $ 149,723 $ 155,379 $ 164,098 Interest income * (13,561 ) (14,362 ) (14,297 ) (15,214 ) (15,907 ) Additions from Georgia Bank & Trust Acquisition 307 - - 4,603 - Additions from Park Sterling Bank Acquisition 8,829 - - - - Improved/(Decline in) cash flows affecting nonaccretable difference 5,118 7,756 3,954 5,062 7,177 Other changes, net (173 ) (102 ) (97 ) (107 ) 11 Balance at end of period $ 133,095 $ 132,575 $ 139,283 $ 149,723 $ 155,379 * Interest income does not include interest income from loan advances post-acquisition on lines of credit, late fees or other loan fees.\nThe table above reflects the quarterly roll forward of the acquired credit impaired loan accretable yield.

The increase was generally the result of our merger with PSTB and the inclusion of one month of income. The following provides additional explanations of noninterest income:\nHigher recoveries on acquired credit impaired loans of $981,000 (no impact from the merger with PSTB); Higher mortgage banking income of $298,000, from $453,000 increase in income related to the mortgage servicing right, net of the hedge, from improved mortgage interest rates and less compression, offset by lower gains in the secondary market of $155,000 from less mortgage volume (minor impact from PSTB); Higher fees on deposit accounts of $1.1 million from higher service charges on deposit accounts from NSF fees, increase in fees associated with debit card usage, and higher retail fees. The impact from one month of PSTB on these income items totaled approximately $770,000, or 70% of the total increase; Higher income on trust and investment services of $388,000 partially from PSTB addition; Higher other income of $771,000 from the merger with PSTB and fewer losses on fixed assets.\nCompared to the fourth quarter of 2016, noninterest income grew by $6.3 million. The increase was primarily related to the two mergers of SBFC and PSTB:\n1. Higher trust and investment services income of $1.5 million,\n2. Higher fees on deposit accounts with more customers from the mergers totaling $3.1 million,\n3. Higher recoveries of acquired credit impaired loans totaling $1.6 million (no impact from PSTB or SBFC),\n4. Lower mortgage banking income of $699,000 due primarily to lower volume of mortgages sold in the secondary market (minor impact of PSTB), and\n5. Increase in other income of $733,000 from the cash surrender value of BOLI acquired, from rental income, and from safe deposit rentals.\nNoninterest expense was $104.6 million in the fourth quarter of 2017, an increase of $23.0 million from $81.6 million in the third quarter of 2017. Merger and conversion related expense increased $16.1 million from the cost incurred associated with the merger with PSTB during the quarter. The increases in most other categories was due to the operating expenses of PSTB for the month of December. OREO and trouble loan related expense was less in the fourth quarter of 2017 by $680,000, compared to the third quarter of 2017. The Company experienced lower losses related to write downs of former branch facilities and lower losses associated with acquired OREO sold during the fourth quarter of 2017.\nCompared to the fourth quarter of 2016, noninterest expense was $29.4 million higher. The increase was primarily due to five categories of expense: (1) merger-related and conversion cost increased $12.8 million related to the merger with PSTB, (2) salaries and benefits increased $10.0 million due to the additional employees from Southeastern and Park Sterling and the related benefits and incentives, (3) information services increased $1.5 million due primarily to the branches added from PSTB and Southeastern mergers, (4) net occupancy and furniture and equipment expense increased by $1.4 million and $900,000, respectively, due to the addition of branches added from the Park Sterling and Southeastern mergers, and (5) amortization of intangibles increased $967,000, from additional core deposit intangible from the Park Sterling and Southeastern mergers.\nSouth State Corporation will hold a conference call today, January 23, 2018 at 10 a.m. Eastern Time, during which management will review earnings and performance trends.

It also reflects an adjustment for the deferred tax asset revaluation in the fourth quarter of 2017. Management believes that non-GAAP adjusted measures provide additional useful information that allows readers to evaluate the ongoing performance of the company. Non-GAAP measures should not be considered as an alternative to any measure of performance or financial condition as promulgated under GAAP, and investors should consider the company's performance and financial condition as reported under GAAP and all other relevant information when assessing the performance or financial condition of the company. Non-GAAP measures have limitations as analytical tools, and investors should not consider them in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of the company's results or financial condition as reported under GAAP. Adjusted earnings and the related adjusted return measures (non-GAAP) exclude the following from net income (GAAP) on an after-tax basis: (a) pre-tax merger and branch consolidation related expense of $17.6 million, $1.6 million, $4.3 million, $21.0 million, and $4.8 million, for the quarters ended December 31, 2017, September 30, 2017, June 30, 2017, March 31, 2017, and December 31, 2016, respectively; (b) securities gains, net of $33,000, $525,000 and $110,000 for the quarter ended December 31, 2017, September 30, 2017 and June 30, 2017, and (c) FDIC Loss Share Agreement (LSA) Early Termination of $5.9 million for the twelve month period ended December 31, 2016. In the fourth quarter of 2017, the Company revalued its net deferred tax assets with the Tax Act of 2017 with an increase in our income tax provision of $26.6 million.\n(4) Repossessed assets include OREO and other nonperforming assets.\n(5) Calculated by dividing total non-acquired NPAs by total assets.\n(6) December 31, 2017 ratios are estimated and may be subject to change pending the final filing of the FR Y-9C; all other periods are presented as filed.\n(7) The tangible measures are non-GAAP measures and exclude the effect of period end or average balance of intangible assets. The tangible returns on equity and common equity measures also add back the after-tax amortization of intangibles to GAAP basis net income. Management believes that these non-GAAP tangible measures provide additional useful information, particularly since these measures are widely used by industry analysts for companies with prior merger and acquisition activities. Non-GAAP measures should not be considered as an alternative to any measure of performance or financial condition as promulgated under GAAP, and investors should consider the company's performance and financial condition as reported under GAAP and all other relevant information when assessing the performance or financial condition of the company. Non-GAAP measures have limitations as analytical tools, and investors should not consider them in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of the company's results or financial condition as reported under GAAP. The sections titled \"Reconciliation of Non-GAAP to GAAP\" provide tables that reconcile non-GAAP measures to GAAP.\n(8) Includes noncash loan interest income related to the discount on acquired performing loans of $6.1 million, $2.2 million; $3.3 million; $4.2 million; and $943,000, respectively during the five quarters above.\n(9) Adjusted efficiency ratio is calculated by taking the noninterest expense excluding branch consolidation cost and merger cost divided by net interest income and noninterest income excluding securities gains (losses), OTTI and FDIC early termination of the loss share agreement, which occurred in the second quarter of 2016 and included in the YTD ratio.\nCautionary Statement Regarding Forward Looking Statements\nStatements included in this communication, which are not historical in nature are intended to be, and are hereby identified as, forward looking statements for purposes of the safe harbor provided by Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.
