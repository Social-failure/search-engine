But high water is moving north and could remain at levels preventing shipping into Saturday, the agency forecast.\nThe Rhine is an important shipping route for commodities including oil products such as heating oil, grains, animal feed and coal. It is an important route for Swiss commodity imports.\nIt was also closed due to high water in early January.\nReporting by Michael Hogan, editing by David Evans\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-25T12:36:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-25T12:59:23.023+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
