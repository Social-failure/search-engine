The ZDB association includes more than 35,000 small- and medium-sized firms that form the backbone of Germany’s construction sector.\nWith prices expected to rise by 3.5 percent this year in the construction sector, however, real sales are expected to grow by only 0.5 percent to reach 98 billion euros ($120 billion), the associations added.\nEmployment in construction is expected to rise by 15,000 to 820,000 people, although a growing number of companies are struggling to find skilled workers, they added.\nConstruction was one of the main growth drivers last year when the euro zone’s largest economy expanded by a calendar-adjusted 2.5 percent, the strongest rate since 2011. For 2018, the Ifo economic institute has forecast 2.6 percent growth.
