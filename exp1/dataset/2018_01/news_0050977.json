Bayer had initially hoped to wrap up the deal by end-2017.\nBayer’s Chief Executive Werner Baumann has described antitrust procedures as going to “unimaginable depths”, with more than 4 million pages of documents provided to EU investigators, but the delays have also allowed the target company to cut its debt, lessening the financial burden for Bayer.\nThe Monsanto deal’s value last year was cut to $63.5 billion including debt, down from an initial $66 billion, because the U.S. seeds giant had lowered its financial liabilities.\nBayer has already agreed to sell certain seed and herbicide businesses for 5.9 billion euro ($7.3 billion) to domestic rival BASF but has said it was bracing for antitrust authorities to demand more asset sales.\n($1 = 0.8089 euros)\nEditing by Robert-Jan Bartunek and Alison Williams\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-29T16:15:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-29T16:32:08.038+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
