Aquatic species must always be kept in their natural environment. Crustaceans must now be stunned before killing them,” say the rules adopted by the government on Wednesday that will take effect in March.\nThe regulations also aim to crack down on illegal puppy farms, outlaw automatic devices that punish dogs for barking, spell out conditions for putting down sick or injured animals, and make organizers responsible for animal welfare at public events.\nThe Swiss are not alone in trying to protect lobsters from what activists call cruel treatment in the kitchen.\nNeighboring Italy’s highest court ruled in June that lobsters must not be kept on ice in restaurants because it causes them unjustifiable suffering before they head for death by fine dining.\nReporting by Michael Shields; Editing by Hugh Lawson\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-10T14:51:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-10T15:11:17.026+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
