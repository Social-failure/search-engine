He lived at the factory, one of the company’s largest in China. \nIt is still not known why he jumped, China Labour Watch said in an email. \nFoxconn’s Chinese headquarters in Shenzhen could not be reached for comment outside of normal business hours. \nThe report comes after a small number of students were discovered in November working overtime in Foxconn’s Chinese factory, violating local labor laws. \nApple Inc and Foxconn, formally known as Hon Hai Precision Industry Co and a major supplier to the U.S. firm, have been accused of poor labor practices in the past. \nBut the U.S. firm has been trying to get a grip of such issues, releasing annual reviews of the iPhone supply chain.
