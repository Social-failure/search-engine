The ability to tailor domestic financial rules will be constrained in any case by the need to stick to global rules, it added.\nThe report urged the government to name BoE Governor Mark Carney’s replacement as early as practicable to avoid Britain losing clout in international financial standard-setting bodies as its say over EU rulemaking end in just over a year.\nCarney is due to step down in June 2019, with FCA CEO Andrew Bailey seen as a hot favorite to replace him.\nThe EU is due on Monday to adopt principles for negotiating a deal on how Britain could transition to new trading terms.\nThe lawmakers’ report calls for a period where EU rules remain in force, followed by time to adapt to final trading terms, otherwise firms will be forced to activate their worst-case scenario contingency plans for moving staff and activities to the bloc.\nBritain should reject a trade deal based on the EU’s “equivalence” system whereby Brussels alone decides if rules are aligned enough with EU standards to grant financial market access, the report said.\nBut there were sound reasons for Britain to maintain a “high degree of regulatory alignment” with the EU to preserve mutual market access, it said, echoing comments from UK finance minister Philip Hammond on Thursday.\nReporting by Huw Jones; Editing by Hugh Lawson\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-27T02:01:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-27T02:37:46.021+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
