It said he would take up his role soon.\nKahi, who works with a Nairobi consultancy, had experience turning around distressed businesses, Nakumatt said.\nHe is expected to manage the settling of debts estimated at more than $300 million and would try to revive the business in a slimmed down version with about 20 branches, down from 62 at its peak. When it sought protection in October, the firm had 4,000 staff, but it has closed several outlets since then.\n“It is hoped and expected that the administration order, if properly executed will be beneficial to all the creditors,” Judge Fredrick Ochieng said.\nThe company sought protection using Kenya’s newly enacted company laws, which provide a pathway for distressed firms to avoid complete collapse.\nNakumatt welcomed the ruling saying it had a “strong underlying sustainable core business that is capable of a turnaround with the support of all stakeholders.”\nNo creditors were immediately available for a comment.\nReporting by Duncan Miriri; Editing by Alexander Smith and Edmund Blair\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-01-23T00:01:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-23T18:08:53.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
