He also raised his 2018 and 2019 earnings estimates by 12 cents per share each to $7.05 and $7.65, respectively. \n\"Given McDonald's strong same-store sales momentum, we raise our target multiple on the stock to 27x (from 26x),\" he wrote. The stock's target price is now $190, up from $180. McDonald's shares closed at $172.12 on the last day of trading in 2017, and were up less than 1 percent in midday trading. \nPeter Saleh, an analyst at BTIG, also foresees positive growth for McDonald's and lifted his target price to $200 from $175. \n\"After several years of playing defense, we believe McDonald's is finally returning to an offensive strategy which will yield stronger comp growth and increased market share,\" Saleh wrote in a research note Tuesday. \nSaleh noted that the company's new Dollar Menu, which launches Jan. 4, has an average discount of about 13 percent. This could be a major driver for growth. \nMcDonald's launch of $1 and $2 soft drink and McCaf√© beverages in April of last year has been cited by the company as part of the reason sales have been strong in recent quarters. He estimates McDonald's U.S. same-store sales could \"remain in the mid-single digits\" in 2018 and beyond. \nOn Tuesday, Saleh bolstered his 2018 same-store sales estimate to 4.1 percent growth, up from 3 percent. He also raised his 2019 same-store sales prediction to a 3.9 percent gain, up from 3.3 percent.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-02T20:17:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-02T19:48:13.015+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
