Slideshow (4 Images) \n“The neutral uniform comprises no symbols -- the flag or crest -- of the Russian Federation,” supplier ZASPORT said in a statement, adding that the uniform complied with rules laid down by the International Olympic Committee. \nThe IOC banned Russia from the Games in South Korea for what it said was “unprecedented systematic manipulation” of the anti-doping system. Russia denies the allegations. \nHowever, the IOC left the door open for Russian athletes with a clean doping history to be invited to compete as neutrals under an Olympic flag. Russia’s sports authorities decided to support competitors who take up the IOC invitation.
