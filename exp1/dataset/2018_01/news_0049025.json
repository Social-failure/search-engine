We desire to extend mutual cooperation between our two countries in working towards resolving this issue.” \nJapan has repeatedly pressed China to do more to help rein in North Korea’s missile and nuclear programmes. China says it is committed to enforcing U.N. sanctions, but that all parties need to do more to reduce tensions and restart talks.
