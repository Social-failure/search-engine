The run gave Oregon State a 45-37 lead.\nMcLaughlin added six assists and two steals to his double-figure scoring game.\nStephen Thompson Jr. had 16 points to complement Tinkle’s 21 for Oregon State, which has lost three of its last four games.\nTinkle and Zach Reichle had seven rebounds apiece, helping the Beavers accumulate a 37-26 edge in the game.\nUSC led by as many as eight points in the first half, then needed two free throws from McLaughlin with one second remaining to take a 35-33 advantage into the intermission.\nThe free throws by McLaughlin were the only two the Trojans shot in the half.\n--Field Level Media\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-01-21T11:39:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-21T13:22:00.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
