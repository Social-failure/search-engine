Obviously, he’s physically stronger,” said 12-times grand slam champion Djokovic. \n”Also, as you mentioned, mature. I think he got some big matches in the last 15 months on the big stage. \n”I think that helps to build a confidence and experience, to know what to do in deciding moments. \n“Today he was great in those moments. He showed no weaknesses, not many. I mean, he was really consistent, played a great match.” \nChung will be favourite to beat world number 97 Sandgren, who burnished his own fairytale by beating fifth seed Dominic Thiem on Monday. \n“Yeah, he’s a really good player,” said Chung. “I think he made a first quarter-final, same like me. I‘m just ready for him.”  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-22T16:26:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-22T16:55:26.026+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
