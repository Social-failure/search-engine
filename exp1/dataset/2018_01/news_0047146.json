Is FoMO (fear of missing out) driving the markets? Here's the take of Mark Dowding, a portfolio manager at BlueBay Asset Management, on how markets underwent a psychological switch in the last few months: \"The investor psychology has switched more towards greed. We've seen an equity market that for a number of years has climbed a wall of worry. Investors have been fearful of valuations, fearful of geopolitical risks, but it feels like in the last few months, investor fears have been dissipating and greed has come to the fore.\" \"That's why you see in equities a capitulation of part of the bears and something of an intensification of bull-market stocks. Having risen gradually for a number of years, the move looks likes it's turning more parabolic in nature as greed takes over.\" (Dhara Ranasinghe and Julien Ponthus) BANKS ARE HOT, SURE, BUT ACHTUNG! (1210 GMT) Investing in European banks has been one of the best trades of the year so far, with the sector up close to 7 percent in barely a month, more than double the gain of the pan-European STOXX 600. With rising yields, a buoyant euro zone economy and cash flowing towards cyclical stocks, it could seem like a no-brainer but here's a word of caution from S&P: don't expect a dramatic turnaround among underperformers, especially two German ones. The rating agency has identified six major banks which \"continue to undergo significant strategic and operational adjustment\" and expects them \"to make some progress during 2018, but not to improve significantly\". Within these six banks the outlook is broadly improving for RBS, Barclays, Credit Suisse, and Standard Chartered. But things are not so rosy in Germany and for Deutsche Bank which \"is likely to remain a sustained relative underperformer in its core businesses.\" For Commerzbank, the outlook is negative with the \"risk that the bank won't build and then sustain capitalization\". On the upside, Commerzbank's woes are fuelling M&A speculation. Here's what the performance of the two German banks looks like when compared to their peers since the financial crisis: (Julien Ponthus) ANOTHER BUMPER YEAR SEEN FOR ITALIAN SMALL CAPS (1133 GMT) Italian stocks have shown resilience to uncertainty surrounding the outcome of a national election in March and one of the reasons cited for that is a wave of inflows generated by tax breaks granted to investments into small and mid caps. Even though the so-called PIR scheme, which is running into its second year has raised worries of a possible bubble forming, it looks that the bonanza is set to continue. In a research note today, Equita estimates PIR inflows at 9.1 billion euros this year after attracting 11 billion in 2017 in a market dominated by Banca Mediolanum and Intesa Sanpaolo. They note that Italian small caps trade at 18.3 times 2018 estimated earnings, a 29 percent premium to the Italian market and above the 5-year average of 20 percent. Here some past Reuters stories on the PIR effect and below a chart showing how Italian small/mid caps have outperformed their peers in Europe over the last 12 months: BUZZ-Italian real estate stocks rise on PIR inclusion rumours BUZZ-Equita drops expectation of Italy small-caps correction BRIEF-Banca Mediolanum confirms target of 3 bln euro PIR inflows in 2017 Bubble risks loom for Italy's small caps as new fund scheme sparks rally (Danilo Masoni) TIME TO RE-ENGAGE WITH DEFENSIVES? (1030 GMT) According to Deutsche Bank strategists, it is. In their latest update they affirm their overweight stance on defensives versus cyclicals and upgrade utilities from benchmark to overweight: \"Defensives have sold off by more than would have been suggested by the rise in bond yields\". That being said they point to property firms Vonovia and Deutsche Wohnen, tobacco group Imperial Brands and beer company Heineken as buy-rating stocks that are beneficiaries of a renewed fall in bond yields. For those who instead believe yields should continue to rise, they highlight BNP Paribas , Credit Suisse, Saint Gobain and AXA. (Danilo Masoni) OPENING SNAPSHOT: EUROPE BOUNCES BACK (0835) European shares have opened higher this morning, bouncing back from a one-week low hit in the previous session, as the euro pulled back from a 3-year high. In corporate news, a well-received update from LVMH a dividend increase at Telia and upbeat broker notes for Michelin and Thales are helping the STOXX 600 index rise 0.3 percent. Here's your opening snapshot: (Danilo Masoni) WHAT YOU NEED TO KNOW BEFORE EUROPE OPENS (0744 GMT) European shares are expected to bounce back on Friday with main stock index futures pointing to gains of around 0.3 percent. Such gains however would not be enough to prevent the STOXX 600 from scoring its first weekly loss this year. Luxury goods makers will be in focus after LVMH said it had made a favourable start to 2018 after a revival in Chinese demand boosted sales last year and spurred on some of its major brands like Louis Vuitton. Its Q4 like-for-like sales were higher than forecast. There were strong results and a bullish forecast from Intel, which could help ease market jitters about semiconductor demand, while Commerzbank could be supported after Handelsblatt reported that Goldman, Barclays and SocGen are interested in buying its EMC division. Eyes also on Zalando and Ocado after big price target increases by RBC.
