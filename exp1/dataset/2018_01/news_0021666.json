Hershey, which owns Nestle’s KitKat brand in the United States, would be the obvious partner, one banker said. \nTuesday’s deal only accounts for about 1 percent of Nestle’s sales, but is part of a larger shake-up by chief executive Schneider, a healthcare industry veteran one year into the job. \nSchneider has been tasked with accelerating Nestle’s growth strategy in an increasingly tough environment for multinational food companies due to slowing growth and greater competition from niche, upstart brands. \nNestle’s mass-market chocolate bars, such as BabyRuth, Butterfinger and Crunch, have underperformed rivals for years as consumers have turned towards healthier snacks such as fruit bars and premium chocolate brands such as Lindt ( LISN.S ). \nNestle said last week it was selling Australian chocolate bar Violet Crumble. The company is expanding into consumer health, bidding for the vitamin and supplements business being sold by Germany’s Merck ( MRCG.DE ) after agreeing last month to buy vitamin maker Atrium Innovations.

The chocolate business, which it is selling for $2.8 billion, has about $900 million in sales. \nLiberum analyst Robert Waldschmidt estimates the deal represents a multiple of roughly 20.7 times earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization, which he said “feels like quite a top multiple”. \nWaldschmidt pointed to the recent sale of Reckitt Benckiser’s ( RB.L ) food business, which is higher margin, at 20.3 times EBITDA. \nThird Point, the U.S.-based hedge fund that has pushed Nestle to boost returns, was not immediately available to comment. CHOCOLATE WOES \nThe United States accounts for nearly 19 percent of a global chocolate market worth $102.3 billion at retail, according to Euromonitor. The value of the market has been buoyed by people increasingly choosing more expensive treats, but volume has been weighed down by the popularity of other alternatives. \nNestle has lost market share in recent years, as start-up brands like Kind have grown quickly. \nEven Lindt, whose Lindor chocolate balls command premium prices, has felt the pain, reporting on Tuesday that 2017 organic sales rose only 3.7 percent, below its long-term target of 6 to 8 percent. Sales in North America fell 1.6 percent. \nFerrero was advised by Credit Suisse and Lazard while Davis Polk and Wardwell acted as its legal adviser.
