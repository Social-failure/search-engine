He is already serving a 60-year sentence in federal prison for child pornography convictions.\nBefore the sentence was announced, Nassar apologized to his victims, telling them, \"I will carry your words with me for the rest of my days.\"\nBut Aquilina angrily dismissed his statement as insincere, reading aloud from a letter Nassar wrote to her in which he claimed he was a \"good doctor\" who was \"manipulated\" into pleading guilty, drawing gasps from the courtroom.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-24T21:59:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-24T22:18:01.002+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
