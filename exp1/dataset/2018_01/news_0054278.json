(NYSE: TXT) today announced financial results for the fourth quarter and full year of 2017, and provided guidance for its 2018 financial outlook.\nNet earnings for the quarter were reduced by a provisional tax charge of $1.00 per share resulting from the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (“the Tax Act”), and $0.14 per share of restructuring charges. With these items that were disclosed in an 8-K filing earlier this month, the company reported a loss from continuing operations of $0.40 per share in the quarter, compared to income from continuing operations of $0.78 per share in the fourth quarter of 2016. Adjusted income from continuing operations, a non-GAAP measure that is defined and reconciled to GAAP in an attachment to this release, was $0.74 per share for the fourth quarter of 2017 compared to $0.80 per share in the fourth quarter of 2016.\nRevenues in the quarter were $4.0 billion, up 5.0 percent from the fourth quarter of 2016. Textron segment profit in the quarter was $360 million, down $31 million from the fourth quarter of 2016.\nFor the full year, net earnings were reduced by a provisional tax charge of $0.99 per share resulting from the Tax Act, and $0.32 per share of restructuring charges. Including these items, full-year income from continuing operations was $1.14 per share compared to $3.09 per share last year. Full-year adjusted income from continuing operations, the non-GAAP measure, was $2.45 per share, compared to $2.62 in 2016.\nCash Flow\nNet cash provided by operating activities of continuing operations of the manufacturing group for the full year was $947 million, compared to $988 million last year. Manufacturing cash flow before pension contributions, a non-GAAP measure that is defined and reconciled to GAAP in an attachment to this release, was $889 million compared to $573 million last year.\n“We delivered strong cash performance throughout the year and returned $603 million to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends,” said Textron Chairman and CEO Scott C. Donnelly.\nOutlook\nTextron is forecasting 2018 revenues of approximately $14.6 billion, up 3.0 percent from the prior year. Textron expects full-year 2018 earnings per share from continuing operations will be in the range of $2.95 to $3.15. The company will benefit from the Tax Act and expects an effective tax rate of 22.5% for 2018.\nThe company is estimating net cash provided by operating activities of continuing operations of the manufacturing group will be between $1,170 million and $1,270 million and manufacturing cash flow before pension contributions (the non-GAAP measure) will be between $700 and $800 million, with planned pension contributions of about $55 million.\nDonnelly continued, “Our outlook reflects the continuation of our strategy around growth through new product investments and acquisitions to drive increases in long-term shareholder value. In 2018, we expect these investments to drive increasing organic sales along with margin expansion and strong cash generation.”\nFourth Quarter Segment Results\nTextron Aviation\nRevenues at Textron Aviation of $1.4 billion were down 3 percent, primarily due to lower military volume.\nTextron Aviation delivered 58 new Citation jets, flat with last year, 31 King Air turboprops up from 28 in last year’s fourth quarter, and 2 Beechcraft T-6 trainers, down from 8 last year.\nSegment profit was $120 million in the fourth quarter, down from $135 million a year ago, primarily due to higher research and development expense.\nTextron Aviation backlog at the end of the fourth quarter was $1.2 billion, up $15 million from the end of the third quarter.\nBell\nBell revenues were $983 million, up 11 percent on higher military volumes, partially offset by lower commercial volumes.\nSegment profit of $114 million was down $12 million despite the increase in revenues, primarily related to a change in commercial mix.\nBell backlog at the end of the fourth quarter was $4.6 billion, down $407 million from the end of the third quarter.\nTextron Systems\nRevenues at Textron Systems were $489 million, down from $532 million last year largely on lower volume at Weapons and Sensors.\nSegment profit of $37 million was down from $53 million, primarily reflecting the lower volume at Weapons and Sensors.\nTextron Systems’ backlog at the end of the fourth quarter was $1.4 billion, down $67 million from the end of the third quarter.\nIndustrial\nIndustrial revenues were $1.1 billion, up 20 percent largely related to Arctic Cat.\nSegment profit was up $10 million from the fourth quarter of 2016 due to favorable performance.\nFinance\nFinance segment revenues decreased $3 million and segment profit increased $2 million.\nConference Call Information\nTextron will host its conference call today, January 31, 2018 at 8:00 a.m. (Eastern) to discuss its results and outlook.

As disclosed in our Current Report on Form 8-K filed on January 5, 2018, we decided to take additional restructuring actions to further consolidate operating facilities and streamline product lines. Special charges related to this plan were $48 million and $90 million in the three and twelve months ended December 30, 2017, respectively, and $8 million and $123 million in the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2016, respectively. In addition, we recorded Special charges of $7 million and $40 million in the three and twelve months ended December 30, 2017, respectively, related to the Arctic Cat acquisition, which included restructuring, integration and transaction costs.\n(b) On December 22, 2017, the U.S. Government enacted tax reform legislation known as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the \"Act\"). Income tax expense for the three and twelve months ended December 30, 2017 includes a $266 million one-time charge to reflect our provisional estimate of the net impact of the Act. The charge is primarily related to remeasurement of U.S. federal net deferred tax assets due to the lower enacted tax rate and the Act’s transition tax on previously unremitted earnings of non-U.S. subsidiaries. Textron is continuing its analysis of this legislation and this provisional estimate is subject to change.\n(c) The twelve months ended December 31, 2016 include an income tax benefit of $319 million, inclusive of interest, of which $206 million is attributable to continuing operations and $113 million is attributable to discontinued operations. This benefit is a result of the final settlement with the Internal Revenue Service Office of Appeals for our 1998 to 2008 tax years.\n(d) For the three months ended December 30, 2017, the diluted average shares used to calculate EPS on a GAAP basis excludes potential common shares (stock options and restricted stock units), due to their antidilutive effect resulting from the net loss. For the twelve months ended December 30, 2017, and the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2016, fully dilutive shares were used to calculate EPS.\n(e) Adjusted income from continuing operations and adjusted diluted earnings per share are non-GAAP financial measures as defined in \"Non-GAAP Financial Measures\" attached to this release. The non-GAAP per share information for the three months ended December 30, 2017 is calculated using diluted average shares outstanding of 266,099,000.\nTextron Inc.

These non-GAAP financial measures exclude certain significant items that may not be indicative of, or are unrelated to, results from our ongoing business operations. We believe that these non-GAAP measures may be useful for period-over-period comparisons of underlying business trends and our ongoing business performance, however, they should be used in conjunction with GAAP measures. Our non-GAAP measures should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the related GAAP measures, and other companies may define similarly named measures differently. We encourage investors to review our financial statements and publicly-filed reports in the entirety and not to rely on any single financial measure. We utilize the following definitions for the non-GAAP financial measures included in this release:\nAdjusted income from continuing operations and adjusted diluted earnings per share\nAdjusted income from continuing operations and adjusted diluted earnings per share both exclude Special charges, net of income taxes, the income tax impact from the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the \"Tax Act\") and a significant multi-year income tax settlement. We consider items recorded in Special charges, net of income taxes, such as enterprise-wide restructuring and acquisition-related restructuring, integration and transaction costs, to be of a non-recurring nature that is not indicative of ongoing operations. In addition, both the impact from the Tax Act and the income tax settlement are not considered to be indicative of ongoing operations, since they represent significant one-time adjustments.\nManufacturing cash flow before pension contributions\nManufacturing cash flow before pension contributions adjusts net cash from operating activities of continuing operations (GAAP) for the following:\nExcludes dividends received from Textron Financial Corporation (TFC) and capital contributions to TFC provided under the Support Agreement and debt agreements as these cash flows are not representative of manufacturing operations; Deducts capital expenditures and includes proceeds from the sale of property, plant and equipment to arrive at the net capital investment required to support ongoing manufacturing operations; Adds back pension contributions as we consider our pension obligations to be debt-like liabilities. Additionally, these contributions can fluctuate significantly from period to period and we believe that they are not representative of cash used by our manufacturing operations during the period.\nWhile we believe this measure provides a focus on cash generated from manufacturing operations, before pension contributions, and may be used as an additional relevant measure of liquidity, it does not necessarily provide the amount available for discretionary expenditures since we have certain non-discretionary obligations that are not deducted from the measure.\nIncome (Loss) from Continuing Operations and Diluted Earnings Per Share (EPS) GAAP to Non-GAAP Reconciliation: Three Months Ended Twelve Months Ended December 30, 2017 December 31, 2016 December 30, 2017 December 31, 2016 Income (loss) from continuing operations - GAAP $ (106 ) $ 215 $ 306 $ 843 Restructuring, net of taxes of $16 million, $3 million, $31 million and $45 million, respectively\n32 5 59 78 Arctic Cat restructuring, integration and transaction costs, net of taxes of $2 million and $13 million, respectively\n5 - 27 - Total Special charges, net of income taxes 37 5 86 78 Income tax expense resulting from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act 266 - 266 - Income tax settlement - - (206 ) Adjusted income from continuing operations - Non-GAAP $ 197 $ 220 $ 658 $ 715 Earnings per share:\nIncome (loss) from continuing operations - GAAP (a) $ (0.40 ) $ 0.78 $ 1.14 $ 3.09 Restructuring, net of taxes 0.12 0.02 0.22 0.29 Arctic Cat restructuring, integration and transaction costs, net of taxes 0.02 - 0.10 - Total Special charges, net of income taxes 0.14 0.02 0.32 0.29 Income tax expense resulting from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act 1.00 - 0.99 - Income tax settlement - - - (0.76 ) Adjusted income from continuing operations - Non-GAAP (b) $ 0.74 $ 0.80 $ 2.45 $ 2.62 (a) For the three months ended December 30, 2017, the diluted average shares used to calculate EPS on a GAAP basis excludes potential common shares (stock options and restricted stock units), due to their antidilutive effect resulting from the net loss.
