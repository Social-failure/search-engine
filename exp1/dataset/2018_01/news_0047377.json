During this time there is room for constructive talks,” Erman said.\n($1 = 0.8029 euros)\nReporting by Robert-Jan Bartunek, additional reporting by Marja Novak in Ljubljana; editing by Philip Blenkinsop and Jason Neely\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-26T13:38:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-26T14:00:45.027+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
