(NYSE:PGEM), a leading North American building products manufacturer, and Clayton, Dubilier & Rice (CD&R) announced today a definitive agreement under which CD&R funds will acquire all of the outstanding shares of Ply Gem common stock in a go-private transaction valued at approximately $2.4 billion. Ply Gem’s board of directors unanimously approved the agreement, which provides for the payment of $21.64 per share in cash to all holders of Ply Gem common stock. The cash purchase price represents a premium of approximately 20% over Ply Gem’s closing stock price on January 30, 2018. Promptly following entry into the agreement, stockholders holding greater than 50% of the outstanding shares of Ply Gem common stock executed a written consent to approve the transaction, thereby providing the required stockholder approval.\nCD&R has also entered into a definitive agreement to acquire Atrium Windows & Doors and combine the company with Ply Gem to create an exterior building products company with total revenue of more than $2.4 billion in 2017. The transactions are expected to close simultaneously in the second quarter of 2018 and are subject to the receipt of customary closing conditions, including regulatory approvals. Closing of the acquisition of Ply Gem is not subject to the closing of the acquisition of Atrium. However, assuming both transactions close simultaneously, CD&R funds will own approximately 70% of the new privately-held company, and Atrium shareholders, which include funds managed by Golden Gate Capital, will hold approximately 30%.\nThe new Ply Gem will continue to be headquartered in Cary, NC, and Gary E.

Together with the talented Atrium team, we look forward to providing exceptional value and service to all of our customers and rewarding career opportunities for our associates.”\n“We are excited to combine with Ply Gem and look forward to the synergies that will be achieved through an enhanced product breadth and stronger North American platform, which will allow us to drive topline growth and customer value,” said Ron Cauchi, Atrium CEO.\n“This is a transformational milestone for two highly complementary businesses,” said Nate Sleeper, Partner at CD&R. “Together, Ply Gem and Atrium have a well-positioned platform across North America, a deep set of capabilities to serve customers, and a strong foundation for long-term growth and value creation.”\n“We are pleased to continue our partnership with Atrium and look forward to working closely with Ply Gem and CD&R,” said Rajeev Amara, Managing Director of Golden Gate Capital. “We believe strongly in the long-term growth prospects of joining these two great businesses.”\nCredit Suisse served as financial advisor and Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison LLP served as legal advisor to Ply Gem.
