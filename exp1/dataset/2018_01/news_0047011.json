We have seen their announcement yesterday which we have welcomed. For us we don’t see any solution other than resorting to dialogue,” Sheikh Mohammed added.\nLast June the UAE, along with Saudi Arabia, Bahrain and Egypt, cut off travel and trade ties with Qatar, accusing it of supporting terrorism and their arch-rival Iran.\nDoha denies the charges and says the countries aim to curtail its sovereignty.\nReporting By Dmitry Zhdannikov and Yara Bayoumy; Writing by Noah Browning; Editing by Gareth Jones\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-01-25T20:08:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-26T21:29:40.016+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
