The unit had been shut for maintenance between Dec. 25 and Jan. 27.\nCPC had been fined a maximum T$1 million ($34,320) by Taiwan’s Environment Protection Administration due to severe air pollution from the incident, Taoyuan’s municipal government said in a statement.\nIt called on CPC to revive a plan to re-locate the refinery away from the city after a previous agreement to move the plant by 2013 had lapsed.\n($1 = 29.1410 Taiwan dollars)\nReporting by Jess Macy Yu and Jeanny Kao; Additional reporting by Florence Tan; Editing by Joseph Radford and Richard Pullin\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-01-29T14:41:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-30T18:40:10.005+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
