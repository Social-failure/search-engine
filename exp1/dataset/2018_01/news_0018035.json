Another system was possible two days later\nMuch of the community of about 9,000 remained under mandatory evacuation orders, even unscathed areas, as crews both removed debris and worked to restore water, sanitation, power and gas. All warnings and orders for neighboring Summerland and Carpinteria were lifted.\nTanker trucks sucked muddy water from flooded sections of U.S. 101, the only direct major artery between Los Angeles and the Santa Barbara region and an important route for many people who work in the Santa Barbara region but live down the coast in Ventura County.\nshow chapters California rescuers use dogs, scanners to search deadly mudslide debris 4:08 PM ET Thu, 11 Jan 2018 | 00:44 The California Department of Transportation abandoned an estimate of reopening the highway on Monday and said it was not known when the closure would be lifted.\nAmtrak, which began restoring rail service two days after the flood, was adding cars to trains because of heavy demand. Two boat companies that normally take tourists out to Channel Islands National Park and on whale-watching excursions were ferrying people between the Ventura and Santa Barbara harbors.\nOn land, local, state and federal agencies were conducting simultaneous recovery efforts, the Santa Barbara County Public Works Department said. That included clearing roads, drainage channels and debris basins that are intended to catch mudflows.\nEmergency permits were obtained to dump up to 300,000 cubic yards (229,365 cubic meters) of sediment into the surf line on beaches in Goleta and Carpinteria.\nGetty Images Firefighters search for people trapped in mudslide debris on January 10, 2018 in Montecito, California. The department said the sediment would only consist of wet or dry dirt or mud without rocks, debris or vegetation, and inspectors would refuse any truckload containing unpermitted materials. Occasional rocks would be set aside by hand for disposal.\nSanta Barbara County said emergency permits don't require testing of the material for hazards but that public health authorities were testing the ocean waters. Down the coast in Ventura County, environmental health officials warned that storm runoff can carry disease-causing bacteria and warned the public to avoid contact with ocean water until sampling results can be reviewed next week.\nIn the disaster impact zone, searchers used chain saws and rakes to remove logs and sift through the remnants of what was left of multimillion-dollar homes. Crews with backhoes and jackhammers pulverized enormous boulders that were left when the torrents stopped.\nOrange markings left on doors indicated which homes had already been searched.\nIn one of the hardest hit areas, a silver Mercedes-Benz, its front and rear fenders completely destroyed, sat atop a tree stump, the only thing left where a home once sat.\nRescuers said they would search every piece of debris and pile of dirt to look for the missing.

It erupted Dec. 4 in Ventura County and destroyed more than 1,000 structures as it swept through the city of Ventura and then threatened Carpinteria, Summerland and Santa Barbara. At 440 square miles, it became the largest wildfire in California records.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-11T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-14T00:43:45.016+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
