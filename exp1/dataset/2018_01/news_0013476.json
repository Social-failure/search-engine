His point shot banked off Duchene and past Anderson on Toronto’s 30th shot on goal.\nJames van Riemsdyk pulled Toronto even 54 seconds into the third period with a pretty effort -- not only to get a shot on goal from in tight but also to tally on the rebound. It was his 19th goal of the season, putting him on pace to exceed his career high of 30 goals in a campaign.\nThat set the stage for the exciting finish.\nGabriel Dumont restored Ottawa’s lead when he pounced on a loose puck after his shot from the slot went high and wide and chipped it past Andersen at 2:15 of the third. Toronto’s Morgan Rielly again tied the clash with a seeing-eye point shot that made its way through the screen at 12:28.\nAndersen stopped 28 shots for the Maple Leafs (25-17-3).\n--Field Level Media\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-01-11T11:52:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-11T12:37:02.018+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
