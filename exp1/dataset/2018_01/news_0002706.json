December numbers have not been released as many hedge funds are still tabulating their performance for the year, but so far the industry is on track to post its best returns since 2013, the Hedge Fund Research data show.\nSimilarly Renaissance Technologies, staffed by nearly eight dozen scientists with doctorates in physics, math and other fields, posted a 15 percent gain in its Renaissance Institutional Equities fund, the firmâ€™s oldest portfolio available to outsiders.\nBrahman Capital posted a 12 percent gain in its hedge fund while a portfolio that makes only long bets that securities will rise climbed 22 percent.\nActivist hedge fund Engaged Capital, which pushed for changes at tea maker Hain Celestial Group rental company Rent-A-Center last year, posted a 10.7 percent gain.\nHedge funds are private and generally guard their performance numbers closely. Representatives for the firms declined to comment.\nThe gains suggest better times in the hedge fund industry after investors spent years complaining about low returns and high fees. Investors even added $2.9 billion in new money to the industry in the first three quarters of 2017 after having pulled out $70 billion in 2016, data from Hedge Fund Research show.\nSome firms even celebrated single-digit gains, signaling a rebound after a difficult 2016 or early 2017. Greenlight Capital, run by David Einhorn, ended the year with a 2 percent gain while Folger Hill, run by former SAC chief operating officer Sol Kumin, ended the year with a 2.6 percent gain in its U.S. fund and a 3.6 percent gain in its Asia fund.\nReporting by Svea Herbst-Bayliss; Editing by Susan Thomas\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-04T21:39:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-04T21:52:56.019+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
