Any show of appreciation or thanks is always very welcome.” \nDr. Carol Bernstein, a past president of the American Psychiatric Association and professor of psychiatry and neurology at NYU Langone Health in New York City told Reuters Health by email, “Physician wellbeing is important because physicians who care for themselves will do a better job caring for others, and are less likely to make medical errors or leave the profession.” \nHowever, she added, “Concern about the stigma related to seeking mental health services is overwhelming, in part due to anxiety about licensure, credentialing and hospital privileging.” \nWhile resources to prevent burnout and reduce stress can help, the survey found that only 45 percent of hospital-based doctors and 31 percent of office-based multispeciality practices or outpatient clinics have burnout prevention programs. \nMedscape has a free online Physician Business Academy ( wb.md/2DI8iGi ) to help doctors manage the business and regulatory aspects of their practice, which contribute to burnout, Kane said. \nBernstein added that the Action Collaborative on Clinician Wellbeing and Resilience ( bit.ly/2DHXUOV ) has “important initiatives in progress to address this crisis.” \nSOURCE: wb.md/2DHC51S Medscape, online January 17, 2018.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-17T17:49:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-17T21:23:08.010+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
