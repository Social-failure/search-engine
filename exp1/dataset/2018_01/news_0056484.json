Buran, President and Chief Executive Officer, stated, “I am very pleased to announce that we had record net interest income for 2017. The record net interest income was the result of executing our strategic objectives. During the year, loan growth totaled 7.1%. After essentially no loan growth in the third quarter of 2017, loan growth resumed at a rate of 2.2% (not annualized), with the yield on the fourth quarter’s originations exceeding the quarterly portfolio yield. In the fourth quarter, we undertook steps to reduce both our future credit and margin risks. In order to reduce future credit risk, we reduced the carrying value of the NYC taxi medallion portfolio by over 50% to an average carrying value of $164,000 per NYC taxi medallion by recognizing a provision for loan losses totaling $6.6 million. The remaining book value of this portfolio is $6.8 million. Future margin risk was reduced by entering into forward swap contracts totaling approximately $400 million beginning at various points in 2018 and 2019, with maturity dates five years from the start date. These swaps provide protection to minimize the effects of rising interest rates on interest-bearing liabilities. Our pre-tax, pre-provision core income for 4Q17 was $20.9 million, an increase of $0.9 million from 3Q17 and $3.1 million from 4Q16.”\n“As a result of the Tax Reform, we recorded $3.8 million in tax expense related to the revaluation of our net deferred tax assets based on the new federal corporate tax rate of 21%. For 2018, we expect our effective corporate tax rate to be approximately 23%.”\n“To further reduce the impact of rising interest rates on our net interest margin, in addition to entering into forward swaps, we continued our strategy of focusing our origination efforts on higher yielding loans. This effort provided a 31bps improvement in the yield received on loan originations and purchases in 2017 to 4.06% compared to 3.75% in 2016. Although, we experienced a decline of 10bps in the yield of originations and purchases received in the fourth quarter of 2017, compared to the third quarter of 2017, the yield for the fourth quarter of 2017 exceeded the fourth quarter of 2016 by 34bps. Additionally, the yield of originations and purchases for the fourth quarter of 2017 was 6bps greater than the quarterly average yield of our total loan portfolio for the same period, excluding prepayment penalty and recovered interest from delinquent loans. At December 31, 2017, our total loan portfolio had an average LTV of 39.1% for loans secured by real estate, while maintaining our strong underwriting standards. In the prior quarter we experienced a delay in closing loans resulting in an increase in the loan pipeline to $417.0 million. During the recent quarter, the pipeline has reduced to $359.8 million, yet remains strong and supports our expectation of solid loan growth in the first quarter of 2018. On the liability side of the balance sheet, the cost of funds increased two basis points from the quarter ended September 30, 2017, as government deposits did not replenish to the projected amount which caused us to rely more on relatively higher costing short-term borrowings.”\nMr. Buran continued, “We remain focused on credit quality. Credit quality improved as our non-performing assets decreased by 17% in 2017 and net charge-offs, excluding charge-offs of the taxi medallion loans, remain minimal. Also, total delinquencies have decreased 28% since December 31, 2016. The allowance for loan losses to gross loans has decreased to 0.39% from 0.46% at December 31, 2016 while the allowance for loan losses to non-performing loans increased to 112% from 104% at the end of 2016. The LTV on our non-performing real estate loans at December 31, 2017 is 39.8%.”\n“We continued implementing the strategic objective of improving the scalability of our branch network. During the quarter, we opened two converted branches in the Flushing, Queens market, bringing our total conversions to nine branches at December 31, 2017, with the planned conversion of five more branches by the end of 2018. We estimate that the Universal Banker model provides on average a savings of 20% in compensation costs per converted branch.”\nThe Company retains its focus on preserving strong risk management practices, including conservative underwriting standards and improving yields to achieve improved risk-adjusted returns.\nIn the fourth quarter, commercial business, multi-family, and commercial real estate loan originations and purchases represented 37%, 36%, and 16%, respectively, of all originations, which were made while maintaining conservative loan-to-values, debt coverage ratios, and increasing yield. The average interest rate obtained for fourth quarter originations and purchases totaled 4.15%, a decrease of 10bps compared to 4.25% for 3Q17 and an increase of 34bps compared to 3.81% for 4Q16. The average rate of mortgage loan applications in the pipeline totaled 4.10% at December 31, 2017, as compared to 4.04% at September 30, 2017 and 4.20% at December 31, 2016. Multi-family (excluding underlying co-operative mortgages), commercial real estate, and one-to-four family mixed-use property mortgage loans originated during 4Q17 had a yield of 3.91%, a decrease of 21bps from 4.12% for 3Q17 and an increase of 25bps from 3.66% for 4Q16. We have maintained our asset quality as these loans had an average loan-to-value ratio of 50.4% and an average debt coverage ratio of 172%.\nMr. Buran concluded, “As recently announced, we have already shared some of the anticipated benefits of the recent Tax Reform with our non-executive employees in the form of one-time bonuses and with our shareholders in the form of our planned 11% increase in our quarterly dividend. We continue to evaluate opportunities to invest additional tax savings into the business to position the Company for future growth. We remain well capitalized and positioned to deliver profitable growth and long-term value to our shareholders as we continue to execute on our strategic objectives.”\n1 See the table entitled “Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures.”\nSummary of Strategic Objectives\nIncrease core deposits and continue to improve funding mix Increase net interest income by leveraging loan pricing opportunities and portfolio mix Enhance core earnings power by improving scalability and efficiency Manage credit risk Maintain well capitalized levels under all stress test scenarios\nEarnings Summary:\nNet Interest Income\nNet interest income for 4Q17 was $43.1 million, an increase of $0.7 million, or 1.7% YoY (December 31, 2017 compared to December 31, 2016) and was unchanged QoQ (December 31, 2017 compared to September 30, 2017).\nNet interest margin of 2.90%, decreased 6bps YoY but remains unchanged QoQ Net interest spread of 2.75%, decreased 9bps YoY and 2bps QoQ Net interest income includes prepayment penalty income from loans and securities of $1.4 million in 4Q17 compared with $1.6 million in 4Q16 and 3Q17, and recovered interest from delinquent loans of $0.1 million in 4Q17, compared to $0.6 million in 4Q16 and $0.3 million in 3Q17 Net interest income includes $0.4 million in accelerated accretion of discount upon call of CLO securities in 4Q17 Excluding prepayment penalty income, accelerated accretion of discount and recovered interest from nonaccrual loans, the yield on interest-earning assets was 3.90% in 4Q17, an improvement from 3.77% in 4Q16 and 3.87% in 3Q17, and the net interest margin was 2.77% in 4Q17, which decreased from 2.81% in 4Q16 and was unchanged from 2.77% in 3Q17 Average balance of total interest-earning assets of $5,934.5 million, increased $217.2 million, or 3.8% YoY and decreased $1.6 million QoQ Yield on interest-earning assets of 4.02%, increased 10bps YoY and 2bps QoQ Cost of interest-bearing liabilities of 1.27%, increased 19bps YoY and 4bps QoQ Cost of funds of 1.17%, increased 16bps YoY and 2bps QoQ, driven by increases in rates paid on certificates of deposit, government deposits and short-term borrowings resulting from increases in the Fed Funds rate during 2017\nProvision for loan losses\nProvision recorded for loan losses for 4Q17 was $6.6 million compared to none in 4Q16 and $3.3 million in 3Q17.\nProvision was primarily driven by a reduction in the estimated fair value of NYC taxi medallions based on most recent sales data Remaining balance of taxi medallion portfolio totals $6.8 million\nNon-interest Income\nNon-interest income for 4Q17 was $3.1 million, a decrease of $12.4 million, or 80.1%, YoY and an increase of $1.4 million, or 84.5% QoQ.\nNon-interest income included net losses from fair value adjustments of $0.6 million in 4Q17, $0.5 million in 4Q16 and $1.3 million in 3Q17, net gains on sale of building of $14.2 million in 4Q16 and net losses from the sale of securities of $0.8 million in 4Q16 and $0.2 million in 3Q17 Absent above items, non-interest income was $3.7 million, an increase of $1.1 million YoY and $0.6 million QoQ\nNon-interest Expense\nNon-interest expense for 4Q17 was $25.9 million, a decrease of $9.5 million, or 26.8%, YoY and $0.1 million, or 0.3% QoQ.\nAs part of a balance sheet restructure, 4Q16 included a non-recurring pre-payment penalty on borrowings of $8.3 million; absent this item, non-interest expense decreased $1.2 million, or 4.5% YoY, driven by decreased salaries and benefits, foreclosure expense due to continued improvement in asset quality and a reduction in FDIC insurance expense, due to lower assessment rates Lower costs associated with FDIC insurance and foreclosure expense should be sustainable The efficiency ratio was 55.4% in 4Q17 compared to 59.6% in 4Q16 and 56.5% in 3Q17\nProvision for Income Taxes\nThe provision for income taxes in 4Q17 was $7.7 million, a decrease of $0.4 million, or 5.2%, YoY and an increase of $2.4 million, or 45.4%, QoQ.\nAdditional tax expense totaling $3.8 million from revaluation of net deferred tax assets due to new federal corporate tax rate of 21% Absent the above item, the effective tax rates were 28.7% in 4Q17, 36.2% in 4Q16 and 34.2% in 3Q17 The improvement in the Company’s effective tax rate in 4Q17 was primarily due to increased impact of preferential tax items\nFinancial Condition Summary:\nLoans:\nNet loans held for investment were $5,156.6 million reflecting an increase of 2.2% QoQ (not annualized) and 7.1% for 2017 as we continue to focus on the origination of multi-family, commercial real estate and commercial business loans with a full relationship while emphasizing rate over volume Loan originations and purchases of multi-family, commercial real estate and commercial business loans totaled $293.8 million for 4Q17, or 89.3% of loan production Loan pipeline was $359.8 million at December 31, 2017, compared to $417.0 million at September 30, 2017 and $310.9 million at December 31, 2016 The loan-to-value ratio on our portfolio of real estate dependent loans as of December 31, 2017 totaled 39.1% Mortgage loan originations and purchases in 4Q17 were more heavily weighted towards multi-family loans, which generally have a lower average yield than commercial mortgages\nThe following table shows the average rate received from loan originations and purchases for the periods indicated:\nFor the three months ended December 31, September 30, December 31, Loan type 2017 2017 2016 Mortgage loans 3.92 % 4.13 % 3.70 % Non-mortgage loans 4.52 % 4.43 % 4.05 % Total loans 4.15 % 4.25 % 3.81 %\nCredit Quality:\nNon-performing loans totaled $18.1 million, a decrease of $3.3 million, or 15.3%, from $21.4 million at December 31, 2016 Classified assets totaled $34.0 million, a decrease of $10.0 million, or 22.8%, from $44.0 million at December 31, 2016, primarily due to reductions in non-performing loans and our exposure to taxi medallion loans Loans classified as troubled debt restructured (TDR) totaled $13.2 million, a decrease of $4.2 million, or 24.3%, from $17.4 million at December 31, 2016, due to the reduction in our exposure to taxi medallion loans We anticipate continued low loss content in the portfolio, as our strong underwriting standards coupled with our practice of obtaining updated appraisals and recording charge-offs early in the delinquency process has resulted in a 39.8% average loan-to-value for non-performing loans collateralized by real estate at December 31, 2017 Provision for loan losses of $9.9 million was recorded during the year ended December 31, 2017, as the estimated fair value of NYC taxi medallions was lowered based on most recent sales data, while no provision for loan losses was recorded during 2016; net charge-offs totaled $11.7 million during the year ended December 31, 2017, of which $11.2 million was related to taxi medallion loans, compared to net recoveries of $0.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2016\nCapital Management:\nThe Company and Bank, at December 31, 2017, were both well capitalized under all applicable regulatory requirements During the year ended December 31, 2017, stockholders’ equity increased $18.8 million, or 3.6%, to $532.6 million due to net income of $41.1 million, partially offset by the declaration and payment of dividends on the Company’s common stock and repurchases of the Company’s common stock During the year ended December 31, 2017, the Company repurchased 241,625 treasury shares at an average cost of $27.59 per share;

each non-GAAP measures used in this release. A reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures appears in tabular form at the end of this release. The Company believes that these measures are useful for both investors and management to understand the effects of certain non-interest items and provide an alternative view of the Company's performance over time and in comparison to the Company's competitors. These measures should not be viewed as a substitute for net income. The Company believes that tangible book value per common share is useful for both investors and management as these are measures commonly used by financial institutions, regulators and investors to measure the capital adequacy of financial institutions. The Company believes these measures facilitate comparison of the quality and composition of the Company's capital over time and in comparison to its competitors. These measures should not be viewed as a substitute for total shareholders' equity.\nThese non-GAAP measures have inherent limitations, are not required to be uniformly applied and are not audited. They should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of results reported under GAAP. These non-GAAP measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies.\nFLUSHING FINANCIAL CORPORATION and SUBSIDIARIES\nRECONCILIATION OF GAAP EARNINGS and CORE EARNINGS\n(Dollars in thousands, except per share data)\n(Unaudited) Three Months Ended Twelve Months Ended December 31, September 30, December 31, December 31, December 31, 2017 2017 2016 2017 2016 GAAP income before income taxes $ 13,650 $ 15,470 $ 22,402 $ 66,134 $ 106,019 Net loss from fair value adjustments 631 1,297 509 3,465 3,434 Net loss (gain) on sale of securities - 186 839 186 (1,524 ) Gain from life insurance proceeds - (238 ) (2 ) (1,405 ) (460 ) Net gain on sale of buildings - - (14,204 ) - (48,018 ) Prepayment penalty on borrowings - - 8,274 - 10,356 Core income before taxes 14,281 16,715 17,818 68,380 69,807 Provision for income taxes for core income 4,652 5,812 6,227 22,613 25,855 Core net income $ 9,629 $ 10,903 $ 11,591 $ 45,767 $ 43,952 GAAP diluted earnings per common share $ 0.21 $ 0.35 $ 0.50 $ 1.41 $ 2.24 Net loss from fair value adjustments, net of tax 0.01 0.03 0.01 0.07 0.07 Net loss (gain) on sale of securities, net of tax - - 0.02 - (0.03 ) Gain from life insurance proceeds - (0.01 ) - (0.05 ) (0.02 ) Net gain on sale of buildings, net of tax - - (0.29 ) - (0.95 ) Prepayment penalty on borrowings - - 0.17 - 0.21 Federal tax reform of 2017 0.13 - - 0.13 - Core diluted earnings per common share* $ 0.33 $ 0.37 $ 0.40 $ 1.57 $ 1.52 Core net income, as calculated above $ 9,629 $ 10,903 $ 11,591 $ 45,767 $ 43,952 Average assets 6,243,686 6,239,321 6,003,125 6,217,746 5,913,534 Average equity 537,201 536,468 512,317 530,300 496,820 Core return on average assets** 0.62 % 0.70 % 0.77 % 0.74 % 0.74 % Core return on average equity** 7.17 % 8.13 % 9.05 % 8.63 % 8.85 % * Core diluted earnings per common share may not foot due to rounding. ** Ratios are calculated on an annualized basis.\nFLUSHING FINANCIAL CORPORATION and SUBSIDIARIES\nRECONCILIATION OF GAAP EARNINGS and CORE EARNINGS\nBEFORE PROVISION FOR LOAN LOSSES and INCOME TAXES\n(Dollars in thousands, except per share data)\n(Unaudited) Three Months Ended Twelve Months Ended December 31, September 30, December 31, December 31, December 31, 2017 2017 2016 2017 2016 GAAP income before income taxes $ 13,650 $ 15,470 $ 22,402 $ 66,134 $ 106,019 Provision for loan losses 6,595 3,266 - 9,861 - Net loss from fair value adjustments 631 1,297 509 3,465 3,434 Net loss (gain) on sale of securities - 186 839 186 (1,524 ) Gain from life insurance proceeds - (238 ) (2 ) (1,405 ) (460 ) Net gain on sale of buildings - - (14,204 ) - (48,018 ) Prepayment penalty on borrowings - - 8,274 - 10,356 Core income before provision for loan losses and income taxes $ 20,876 $ 19,981 $ 17,818 $ 78,241 $ 69,807\nFLUSHING FINANCIAL CORPORATION and SUBSIDIARIES\nCALCULATION OF TANGIBLE STOCKHOLDERS’\nCOMMON EQUITY to TANGIBLE ASSETS\n(Unaudited) December 31, December 31, (Dollars in thousands) 2017 2016 Total Equity $ 532,608 $ 513,853 Less: Goodwill (16,127 ) (16,127 ) Intangible deferred tax liabilities 291 389 Tangible Stockholders' Common Equity $ 516,772 $ 498,115 Total Assets $ 6,299,274 $ 6,058,487 Less: Goodwill (16,127 ) (16,127 ) Intangible deferred tax liabilities 291 389 Tangible Assets $ 6,283,438 $ 6,042,749 Tangible Stockholders' Common Equity to Tangible Assets 8.22 % 8.24 %\nSusan K.
