(NASDAQ:ACBI) announced a loss of $15.3 million, or ($0.59) per diluted share for the fourth quarter of 2017, compared to net income of $4.0 million, or $0.16 per diluted share, in the third quarter of 2017. The tax reform legislation signed into law on December 22, 2017 resulted in a reduction of the value of our deferred tax asset and an increase in tax expense of $17.4 million, or ($0.67) per diluted share, in the fourth quarter of 2017. Net loss for the full year 2017 was $3.7 million, or ($0.14) per diluted share, compared to net income for the full year 2016 of $13.4 million, or $0.53 per diluted share.\nFourth Quarter Highlights\nGrew loans held for investment by $28.4 million to $1.93 billion from September 30, 2017.

Decreased nonperforming assets to 0.14% of total assets from 0.23% in the third quarter of 2017. Recorded expense of $2.2 million related to the previously announced resignation of the President and Chief Operating Officer and a planned reduction of staff.\n2017 Highlights\nGrew commercial and industrial loans by $84.3 million, or 16%, from December 31, 2016. Grew average noninterest bearing deposits by $71.3 million, or 13%, from 2016. Reported taxable equivalent net interest margin of 3.28%, an increase of 16 basis points from 2016. Grew income from SBA lending activities by $487,000, or 13%, from 2016. Completed the sale of our Cleveland Tennessee branch in the first quarter of 2017.\n2018 Expectations\nAnticipate closing on the sale of the Southeast Trust Company in the second quarter of 2018, with an expected gain of approximately $1.7 million. Plan additional severance expense in the first quarter of 2018 from the reduction of staff and the closing of our Charlotte loan production office. Anticipate the consolidation of two branches in Chattanooga, Tennessee during the first quarter of 2018. Estimate the 2018 effective tax rate to be approximately 20%.\n“Atlantic Capital’s earnings in the fourth quarter of 2017 were affected not only by the change in tax law, but also by several actions management has taken to drive growth in our core businesses, streamline the structure of our organization, and position the Company for better performance in 2018 and beyond. This disciplined focus on efficiency, alignment, and productivity will continue in our day to day management of the Company,” explained Douglas Williams, President and Chief Executive Officer.\n“We are confident as we begin 2018 that the cost saving, restructuring, and new investment decisions we have made will allow us to bring our successful and focused banking strategy to the entire Atlantic Capital footprint, while providing best of class service and solutions to our clients and prospects. Our banking teams are now almost fully staffed and are better aligned for meaningful improvement in performance. Our balance sheet is strong and our credit quality is sound. We are ready for 2018.”\nIncome Statement\nNet interest income increased to $21.1 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 from $20.3 million in the third quarter of 2017, primarily as a result of higher loan and investment yields. Net accretion income on acquired loans totaled $686,000 in the fourth quarter of 2017 compared to $343,000 in the third quarter of 2017.\nTaxable equivalent net interest margin was 3.39% in the fourth quarter of 2017, an increase of 13 basis points from the third quarter of 2017. The accretion from the acquired loan discount and amortization of time deposit premium contributed 12 basis points to the net interest margin in the fourth quarter of 2017 compared to 6 basis points in the third quarter of 2017.\nLoan yields in the fourth quarter of 2017 increased 20 basis points to 4.61% from the third quarter of 2017 as a result of the December increase in the fed funds rate, an increase in loan fees and an increase in accretion income. Loan fees contributed 25 basis points to the loan yield in the fourth quarter of 2017 compared to 20 basis points in the third quarter of 2017. Accretion income contributed 15 basis points to the loan yield in the fourth quarter of 2017 compared to 7 basis points in the third quarter of 2017.\nThe cost of total deposits in the fourth quarter of 2017 was 0.52%, an increase of 2 basis points from the third quarter of 2017. The cost of interest bearing deposits increased 1 basis point to 0.73% from the third quarter of 2017.\nThe provision for loan losses was $282,000 in the fourth quarter of 2017 compared to $322,000 in the third quarter of 2017. Non-performing assets to total assets improved to 0.14% in the fourth quarter of 2017, compared to 0.23% for the third quarter of 2017. The fourth quarter included a recovery of $192,000 on a $7.7 million loan relationship that was charged-off in the third quarter of 2017.\nNoninterest income totaled $3.6 million in the fourth quarter of 2017, an increase of $91,000 from the third quarter of 2017. The increase included higher derivatives income of $97,000, and higher trust income of $45,000, resulting from an increase in assets under management. This was offset by a decrease in mortgage income of $30,000 due to lower residential mortgage loan sales and a decrease in SBA income of $45,000 resulting from lower loan sales.\nNoninterest expense totaled $20.6 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 compared to $17.5 million in the third quarter of 2017. Salaries and employee benefits expense increased by $2.9 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 to $13.3 million. The fourth quarter salaries and benefits expense included $937,000 in severance expense, $1.3 million in expenses related to the President and Chief Operating Officer’s resignation, and the additional expense of adding new SBA and Tennessee commercial bankers.\nBalance Sheet\nTotal loans were $1.94 billion at December 31, 2017, an increase of $26.6 million from September 30, 2017. Loans held for investment were $1.93 billion at December 31, 2017, an increase of $28.4 million from September 30, 2017, as commercial and industrial loans grew $52.9 million during the quarter due to an increase in new loan originations and increased balances on existing loans. This increase was offset by a $27.7 million decrease in investment commercial real estate and construction and land loans related to the timing of payoffs.\nAt December 31, 2017, the allowance for loan losses was $19.3 million, or 1.00% of loans held for investment, compared to $18.9 million, or 0.99% of loans held for investment as of September 30, 2017. Annualized net charge-offs to average loans totaled (0.04%) in the fourth third quarter of 2017 and totaled 0.23% for 2017. Nonperforming assets totaled $4.1 million, or 0.14% of total assets, as of December 31, 2017, compared to $6.0 million, or 0.23% of total assets, as of September 30, 2017.\nTotal average deposits for the fourth quarter of 2017 were $2.19 billion, an increase of $73.6 million from the third quarter of 2017. Average noninterest bearing deposits increased $21.2 million to $649.2 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 and accounted for 29.6% of average total deposits.\nTotal deposits were $2.45 billion at December 31, 2017, an increase of $347.0 million from September 30, 2017. This increase included higher than normal levels of seasonal volatility at year-end.\nEarnings Conference Call\nThe Company will host a conference call at 10:00 a.m. EST on Monday, January 29, 2018, to discuss the financial results for the quarter ended December 31, 2017.

Atlantic Capital management uses non-GAAP financial measures, including: (i) operating net income; (ii) operating non-interest expense; (iii) operating non-interest income; (iv) taxable equivalent interest income; (v) taxable equivalent net interest margin; (vi) efficiency ratio; (vii) operating return on average assets; (viii) operating return on average equity; (ix) tangible common equity; and (x) tangible book value, in its analysis of the Company's performance. Operating net income excludes the following from net income available to common shareholders: merger and conversion costs, net gains on branch sales, and the income tax effect of adjustments. Operating net income also excludes the revaluation of net deferred tax assets. Operating non-interest expense excludes merger and conversion costs from non-interest expense as well as costs related to the sale of branches. The efficiency ratio excludes merger and conversion costs. Tangible common equity excludes goodwill and other intangible assets from shareholders' equity.\nManagement believes that non-GAAP financial measures provide a greater understanding of ongoing performance and operations, and enhance comparability with prior periods. Non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered as an alternative to any measure of performance or financial condition as determined in accordance with GAAP, and investors should consider Atlantic Capital’s performance and financial condition as reported under GAAP and all other relevant information when assessing the performance or financial condition of the Company. Non-GAAP financial measures have limitations as analytical tools, and investors should not consider them in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of the results or financial condition as reported under GAAP. Non-GAAP financial measures may not be comparable to non-GAAP financial measures presented by other companies.\nForward-Looking Statements\nThis press release contains “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.
