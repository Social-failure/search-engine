There’s a lot of components that come into the game,” Dimitrov said. \n”I was at least happy I found the way (to the quarter-finals). Doesn’t matter how fit I am, I think mentally I was just a little bit tired. With each match, you’re draining up. \n”You try things the next day to kind of get better, get into a better shape, in a better head space. \n“Today was just one of those days that I just couldn’t find a way. Simple as that. You have days like that.” \nDimitrov’s title run on his debut at the ATP Finals in November meant his off-season was shorter than usual. \nIt also meant he arrived in Melbourne as one of the favourites for the title -- a situation he will have to learn to deal with if his career is to continue on the upward curve. \n”In order for me to be a top three guy or chase number one one day, this is what I have to do year in and year out,“ he said. ”This is my first year I’ve done something like this. \n”At least I know what it is. I’ve gone through the way now. At the same time, I still need to push and see where the limits are. For sure once you get to the top, everything becomes more narrow. You have a bigger target on your back. \n“Everybody wants to beat you. Everybody plays better matches against you. So, yeah, it gets harder.” Reporting by Martyn Herman; Editing by Amlan Chakraborty", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-23T10:41:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-23T11:00:04.005+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
