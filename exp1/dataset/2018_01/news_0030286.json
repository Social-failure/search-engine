The rest of the world together account for less than half of their numbers.\nAt a time when the gap should be closing, USA Hockey officials concede that it probably expanded this year after the U.S. national team threatened a boycott of the world championships over wages and support for the women’s program.\nThe standoff ended with the players securing a year round monthly training allowance, larger bonuses for winning medals, more resources and a high performance advisory group to help develop the game at the youth level.\nUSA Hockey has pushed a “good for the sport” spin on the outcome, rationalizing it as a sort of hockey version of trickle-down economics that will ultimately be good for the global game.\nThe theory is that by the U.S. investing more in women’s hockey other countries will be forced to do the same if they are to keep pace.\nBut the reality is that outside of Canada few countries have the appetite to pour similar amounts of cash into women’s hockey.\n“Obviously what happened last spring moves it up another level, which quite frankly I hope pushes other people to say, look we’ve got to do the same because if it gets lopsided this is not a good thing,” U.S. women’s head coach Robb Stauber told Reuters. “Time will tell if other countries up their funding and take what happened here as a lesson that maybe we can do more.”\nFor the moment Canada and the U.S. have set a gold medal standard no other countries can match.\nWhile Olympic group play has generated the predictable and disheartening mismatches, hockey fans, with some certainty, know they are in for a treat once the tournament reaches the championship game.\nWhen Canada and the U.S. meet it is often 24 karat entertainment. Four of the last six world championship finals between the two have gone to overtime while an extra session was also needed to decided the Olympic champion in Sochi.\nCanada and the United States have become not just one of the Winter Games great rivalries but one of best in winter sport.\n“I know they love to hate each other,” said Renney. “They all know each other and have great respect for each other but I can tell you right now when the puck drops it is war.”\nReporting by Steve Keating in Toronto.
