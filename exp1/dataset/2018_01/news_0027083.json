Earnings per share rose to $1.28 per share from $1.14 a year earlier. \nExcluding the major tax charges, analysts had expected earnings per share of $1.19. It was not immediately clear if the results were comparable, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. \nCitigroup, the fourth-largest U.S. bank by assets, said it expects to benefit in future quarters from the new tax law as its tax rate falls to about 25 percent in 2018 from 30 percent in 2017. \nWall Street analysts expect Citigroup to generally benefit less than other banks as the New York-based bank earns about half of its profits overseas, where corporate tax rates are mostly lower than the United States. \nOn Friday, JPMorgan Chase & Co, the biggest U.S. bank, said it had taken $2.4 billion in one-time tax expenses, primarily for income earned overseas in the past. The bank said quarterly profit excluding the tax law impact was down 1 percent.( bit.ly/2AR7AUe ) \nBank of America Corp, the second-biggest U.S. lender, and investment banking house Goldman Sachs Group Inc are expected to report fourth-quarter results on Wednesday.
