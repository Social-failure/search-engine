We are collecting information as to the intentions and capabilities of North Korea armed forces,” he told Reuters.\n“By conducting different military actions, one of the objectives that the U.S. might have is to drive a wedge between political leaders and military leaders inside North Korea,” he added.\nNorth Korea has made no secret of its plans to develop a missile capable of hitting the U.S. mainland and has fired two missiles over Japan, putting Tokyo in range.\nHowever, Michishita said he did not expect U.S. President Donald Trump to undertake a preventive strike.\n“In order to destroy an important part of North Korea’s nuclear and missile programmes, you have to really undertake a major war against North Korea almost. Conventional, but a major war,” Michishita said.\nAny attack would need to destroy North Korea’s nuclear and missile programmes as well as conventional weapons such as long-range artillery and rocket launchers aimed at Seoul, he said.\nReporting by Stephanie Nebehay; editing by Alexander Smith\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-13T15:29:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-13T15:52:50.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
