But I‘m also thankful about all the things, because I think I‘m growing ...” \nKerber signalled her resurgence with her triumph at the Sydney International on Saturday and was optimistic about 2018 following her flawless start to the new season. \n”I think so far it was a good season, the start of the good season, and I‘m just trying to playing every single match each. \n“I‘m not trying to focusing too much on ahead, on past, or what’s happened in the last year. I‘m just trying to really restart again and try to enjoy my tennis again...” \nKerber will take on Donna Vekic of Croatia in her next match.
