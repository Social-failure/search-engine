We’ve sold what we’re going to sell and we’ve bought what we’re going to buy,” Garofalo said speaking at the Vancouver-based company’s annual investor day.\nGoldcorp, the world’s fifth-biggest gold miner by market value, has made several acquisitions and sales in the past two years, including the purchase last March of a 50 percent stake in the Cerro Casale gold in Chile, one of the world’s largest undeveloped gold deposits. It has also made a number of sales of smaller, non-core assets.\nGoldcorp said earlier that it expects its costs on an all-in sustaining basis to decline to around $800 an ounce in 2018 from around $825 an ounce in 2017.\nIt expects production of 2.5 million ounces of gold this year, unchanged from a previous forecast and in line with preliminary output of 2.6 million ounces last year.\nGoldcorp’s stock was down 2.6 percent, sliding along with other gold shares on a weaker gold price.\nThe miner left unchanged its 20/20/20 plan, which forecasts costs decreasing by 20 percent and production and gold reserves rising by 20 percent by 2021.\nAfter 2020, Goldcorp sees some scope for driving production above 3 million ounces, Garofalo said.
