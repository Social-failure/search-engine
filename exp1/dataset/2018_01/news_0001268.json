Last month, Alphabet Inc’s Google announced it would launch a Beijing-based AI research team, targeting local research talent, even though the U.S. firm’s search engine remains blocked behind China’s firewall.\nThe new AI park will focus on attracting enterprises that work on big-data, biometric identification, deep learning and cloud computing, the Xinhua report said on Wednesday.\nBeijing also recently released blueprints for an autonomous driving zone on the city’s outskirts, dedicated to testing and developing local autonomous vehicles.\nReporting by Cate Cadell; Editing by Himani Sarkar\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-03T08:58:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-03T09:11:34.049+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
