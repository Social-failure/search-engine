States must propose such changes through waivers and receive federal approval.\nSeema Verma, the agency's administrator, said the policy guidance came in response to requests from at least 10 states that have proposed requiring some Medicaid recipients to work or participate in activities that may include skills training, education, job search, volunteering or caregiving. Those states include Kentucky, Maine, New Hampshire, Arizona, Indiana and Utah.\nCertain Medicaid populations would be exempt from the rules, including those with disabilities, the elderly, children and pregnant women. Verma also said states would have to make \"reasonable modifications\" for those battling opioid addiction and other substance use disorders.\n\"This gives us a pathway to start approving waivers,\" Verma said on a call with reporters on Wednesday. \"This is about helping those individuals rise out of poverty.\"\nUnder the 2010 Affordable Care Act, former Democratic President Barack Obama's signature domestic policy achievement commonly known as Obamacare, 31 states expanded Medicaid to those making up to 138 percent of the federal poverty level, adding millions of people to the rolls.\nRepublicans have repeatedly failed to repeal and replace Obamacare, a top campaign promise of President Donald Trump. Instead, the Trump administration has sought to weaken the program through executive orders and administrative rules.\nThe Obama administration opposed state efforts to implement work requirements in Medicaid because it could result in fewer people having access to health insurance.\nFor instance, Kentucky last year proposed work requirements for able-bodied adults to get insurance and establishing new fees for all members based on income. A study found the proposal would reduce the number of residents on Medicaid by nearly 86,000 within five years, saving more than $330 million.\nRepublicans argue that Medicaid was created to serve the most vulnerable and has become bloated under Obamacare. Verma and other Republicans said implementing work and community engagement requirements could help improve health outcomes by connecting people with jobs and training.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-11T13:36:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-11T13:52:31.011+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
