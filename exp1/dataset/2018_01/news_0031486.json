Net income for the fourth quarter of 2017 was $55.4 million, or $.64 per diluted common share (EPS), compared to $58.9 million, or $.68 EPS in the third quarter of 2017 and $51.8 million, or $.64 EPS, in the fourth quarter of 2016. The fourth quarter of 2017 includes an estimated $19.5 million ($.22 per share impact) tax reform related re-measurement charge of the net deferred tax asset (DTA), while the third quarter of 2017 included $11.4 million of nonoperating items ($.08 per share) mainly related to the two previously disclosed FNBC transactions. There were no nonoperating items in the fourth quarter of 2016.\nHighlights of the company’s fourth quarter 2017 results (compared to third quarter 2017):\nReported earnings decreased $3.5 million, or 6%; excluding the impact of the DTA re-measurement charge and nonoperating items, earnings increased $8.7 million, or 13% The fourth quarter includes an estimated $19.5 million charge related to the re-measurement of the net deferred tax asset Loans increased $218 million, or 5% linked-quarter annualized; net increase includes a decline in energy loans of $78 million linked-quarter Energy loans totaled $1.1 billion at year-end and comprised 5.6% of total loans, down from 6.0%; allowance for the energy portfolio totaled $70.2 million, or 6.7% of energy loans Core pre-provision net revenue (PPNR) of $116.5 million, up $5.4 million, or 5%; up 34% from the same quarter a year ago Net interest margin (NIM) of 3.48%, up 4 bps; core NIM up 3 bps to 3.35% Operating expenses totaled $168.1 million, up 1% linked-quarter Efficiency ratio improved almost 100 bps to 56.6% Return on average assets (ROA) declined 6 bps to 0.82%; excluding nonoperating items and the DTA charge, ROA increased 11 bps to 1.10% Tangible common equity (TCE) ratio decreased 7 bps to 7.73% mainly related to the DTA re-measurement charge\n“We are extremely proud of a notable quarter to finish a strong year of improving performance,” said John M.

With early achievement of our Corporate Strategic Objectives, we end 2017 on a positive note and enter the new year with opportunities to continue building upon that success. Our “next day” begins with a recently announced wealth management transaction, the combination of our two iconic brands, and a tax reform act likely to benefit all clients and shareholders. These are just a few of the items we have on our plate to start 2018, and we look forward to continuing improvement as we work hard to achieve our updated CSOs. I particularly want to commend our 4,000 team members who worked relentlessly to produce a 2017 we can all be proud of.”\nLoans\nTotal loans at December 31, 2017 were $19.0 billion, up approximately $218 million, or 1%, linked-quarter. Loans to energy-related companies decreased $78 million during the fourth quarter. Net loan growth during the quarter continues to be diversified across the footprint and also in areas identified as part of the company’s revenue-generating initiatives.\nAverage loans totaled $18.8 billion for the fourth quarter of 2017, up $248 million, or 1%, linked-quarter.\nEnergy\nAt December 31, 2017, loans to the energy industry totaled $1.1 billion, or 5.6% of total loans. As noted earlier, the energy portfolio was down $78 million, or 7%, linked-quarter, and is comprised of credits to both the exploration and production (E&P) sector and the support and services sectors. Payoffs and paydowns of approximately $133 million and charge-offs of approximately $8 million were partially offset by approximately $63 million in fundings.\nThe impact and severity of future risk rating migration, as well as any associated provisions or net charge-offs, will depend on overall oil prices and the duration of the energy cycle that began in November 2014. Recent higher oil prices are helpful in the recovery of credits impacted by the energy cycle, however the key to resolution of many of those credits, especially in support services, is stabilization of prices over the longer term.\nManagement continues to estimate that net charge-offs from energy-related credits could approximate up to $95 million over the duration of the cycle, of which approximately $76 million has been taken to-date. While we expect additional charge-offs in the portfolio, we continue to believe the impact of the energy cycle on our loan portfolio will be manageable, our reserve is adequate and our capital will remain solid.\nDeposits\nTotal deposits at December 31, 2017 were $22.3 billion, up $719 million, or 3%, from September 30, 2017. The increase is mainly related to annual year-end seasonality of public fund deposits.\nNoninterest-bearing demand deposits (DDAs) totaled $8.3 billion at December 31, 2017, up $411 million, or 5%, from September 30, 2017. DDAs comprised 37% of total period-end deposits at December 31, 2017.\nInterest-bearing transaction and savings deposits totaled $8.2 billion at the end of the fourth quarter of 2017, up $288 million, or 4%, from September 30, 2017. Time deposits of $2.7 billion were down $258 million, or 9%, while interest-bearing public fund deposits increased $278 million, or 10%, to $3.0 billion at December 31, 2017.\nAverage deposits for the fourth quarter of 2017 were $21.8 billion, up $413 million, or 2%, linked-quarter.\nAsset Quality\nNonperforming assets (NPAs) totaled $401 million at December 31, 2017, up $13.2 million from September 30, 2017. During the fourth quarter of 2017, total nonperforming loans increased approximately $6.9 million, while foreclosed and surplus real estate (ORE) and other foreclosed assets increased approximately $6.3 million.

The ratio of the allowance for loan losses to period-end loans was 1.14% at December 31, 2017, down 5 bps from 1.19% at September 30, 2017. The allowance for credits in the energy portfolio totaled $70.2 million, or 6.7% of energy loans, at December 31, 2017, as compared to $79.8 million, or 7.0% of energy loans, at September 30, 2017.\nNet charge-offs were $21.0 million, or 0.44% of average total loans on an annualized basis in the fourth quarter of 2017, up from $11.8 million, or 0.25% of average total loans in the third quarter of 2017.
