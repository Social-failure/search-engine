The greenback’s recovery was also stoked by anxiety over whether German Chancellor Angela Merkel would manage to form a “grand coalition” to govern.\nMembers of the centre-left Social Democrats (SPD) in one of Germany’s regions voted against talks with Merkel’s conservative Christian Democrats (CDU) on Monday, and fresh headlines on that development triggered a fall in the euro in early European trading on Tuesday.\nThe euro was up 0.06 percent at $1.2268.\nIts weakness against the dollar dissipated as Wall Street stocks turned lower on profit-taking that emerged after the Dow hit the 26,000 mark for the first time.\nThe reversal on U.S. stocks kindled safehaven demand for the yen and Swiss franc.\nFILE PHOTO: A picture illustration of U.S. dollar, Swiss franc, British pound and Euro bank notes January 26, 2011. REUTERS/Kacper Pempel/Illustration/File Photo The dollar was down 0.18 percent at 110.32 yen, while the greenback was down 0.45 percent at 0.9586 franc per dollar.\nThe euro’s decline did not dent bullish sentiment for more gains in the coming months.\nSpeculators boosted net long positions in the euro to a record high in the week to Jan. 12, according to futures data published on Friday. [IMM/FX]\nThe dollar’s index against a basket of six major currencies was down 0.05 percent at 90.398. It was up from Monday’s three-year low of 90.279.\n“A lot of the dollar’s early strength was just short-coming. There’s a lot of heavy bias for dollar weakness,” said Lennon Sweeting, chief market strategist at XE in Toronto.\nFears of stricter government oversight sparked a broad sell-off in digital currencies.\nCryptocurrencies ethereum and ripple were down 19 percent and 29 percent, respectively. Most cryptocurrencies posted double digit losses, according to Coinmarketcap.\nGraphic - Euro Takes Flight: reut.rs/2DaUgfr\nAdditional reporting by Jemima Kelly in London; Masayuki Kitano in Singapore; Editing by Keith Weir and Steve Orlofsky\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-01-16T09:50:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-16T10:16:50.005+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
