Initial installations are expected in greater metropolitan Tokyo with a national roll-out to follow in subsequent years. \nNokia, a major supplier to DoCoMo in both the 3G and 4G network eras, has been working with the Japanese operator since at least 2014 on trials of 5G equipment, which promises far faster data rates, greater capacity and quicker response times. \nThe 5G antennas and related base stations act as the local connections between users of mobile phones and computing devices with the backbone of any operator’s network. \nThe new equipment also promises to enable DoCoMo to provide new services for autonomous driving, industrial automation and smarter homes by providing wireless links to millions even billions of wireless sensors. Nokia said it will work with DoCoMo to ensure a smooth transition from existing 4G networks.
