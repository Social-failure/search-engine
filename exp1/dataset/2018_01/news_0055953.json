Last year, it became the first country to regulate exchanges at the national level - a move that, at the time, won praise from cryptocurrency traders and exchange operators for boosting innovation while protecting consumers.\n“We should be aware of the need to balance between communicating, to beginners or inexperienced users, the value of these financial products and the risks they entail,” a Line spokeswoman said.\nThe FSA has registered 16 cryptocurrency exchanges so far, with another 16 awaiting clearance as they continue to operate.\nCryptocurrency trading in Japan has spiked in the last year, with the country’s army of retail investors emerging as a major force in bitcoin’s spectacular rally.\nThe country’s global share of the bitcoin market has jumped after clampdowns by authorities in China and South Korea, presenting the prospect of lucrative business for cryptocurrency exchanges.\nShares of Line, which is controlled by South Korea’s Naver Corp, jumped 4 percent by early afternoon, against a 0.25 percent gain for the benchmark Nikkei average.\nLine said it will start trading cryptocurrencies through “Line Financial”, a new company that will also provide loans and insurance via its Line messaging app. Line currently provides money transfer and payment services to 40 million users through its app.\nThe app, known for electronic stickers of a brown bear and his rabbit girlfriend, is ubiquitous in Japan, Line also has a strong presence in Taiwan, Thailand and Indonesia.\nLine went public in the largest tech initial public offering of 2016. After initially struggling to maintain investor enthusiasm, strong sales of advertising space on its messaging app have seen its stock gain almost 60 percent from its IPO price.\n($1 = 108.8500 yen)\nReporting by Thomas Wilson; Additional reporting by Sam Nussey; Editing by Muralikumar Anantharaman\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-31T06:37:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-31T06:44:38.002+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
