The deal has been cast into doubt by Trump, but Britain, along with France and Germany, wants to keep it.

She later said Trump took her hand in a gentlemanly gesture as they walked down a ramp. \nBut British officials have been dismayed by some of Trump’s pronouncements, particularly a proposed ban on Muslims entering the United States and most recently when Trump rebuked May on Twitter after she criticised him for retweeting British far-right anti-Islam videos.

The invitation was accepted, but no date for the visit has been set. \nWhile in London, Tillerson visited the new $1 billion (£719 million) U.S. embassy. Trump earlier this month criticised the move to new diplomatic premises as part of a bad deal agreed by the administration of Barack Obama. \nTrump cancelled a trip to London to open the new embassy, saying he did not want to endorse a bad deal agreed by the Obama administration to sell the old one for “peanuts”. \nTillerson was greeted by U.S. Ambassador Woody Johnson as workers finished planting shrubs in the grounds of the new embassy. America’s top diplomat then met some of the marines who are stationed at the embassy. \n“The embassy actually, is gonna really work,” Johnson said. \nAsked when there would be a ribbon cutting ceremony, Ambassador Johnson said: “At some point we’re going to do it, but there’s no urgency to that. We’ll do it when the time is right.” Editing by Guy Faulconbridge", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-22T16:10:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-22T16:21:47.005+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
