We once had a pony that grew up alongside me and this created a bond that has made me want to devote my life to horses,” said 21-year-old Fares.\nMahmoud Montasir, a Jerusalem teenager who has his own horse, said he had achieved his childhood dream of turning horse-riding into a pastime.\n“It is a great privilege to work with horses. A horse is a very clever animal and understands its human friend and his feelings. A horse also always shares its own feelings with its human friend but you need to understand it,” Montasir said.\nReporting By Mustafa Abu Ganeyeh, Editing by Ori Lewis\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-01-11T00:11:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-10T20:39:36.001+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
