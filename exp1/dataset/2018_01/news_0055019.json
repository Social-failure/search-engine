REUTERS/Jim Young/File Photo \nFor the fourth quarter ended Dec. 31, Boeing’s core earnings nearly doubled to $4.80 per share from $2.47 a year earlier, buoyed by rising plane output and a gain from changes to the U.S. tax law. \nIt booked a one-time tax gain of $1.74 a share due to the lower U.S. corporate tax rate signed into law last month reducing its deferred tax liabilities in the future. \nExcluding the gain, Boeing reported earnings of $3.06 a share. On that basis, Wall Street had been expecting $2.89 a share. \nBoeing forecast that operating cash flow, a key measure of its financial performance, will rise to about $15 billion in 2018, compared with $13.34 billion last year.
