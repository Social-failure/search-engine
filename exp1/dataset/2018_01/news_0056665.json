In July, Kasowitz took on a lesser role in the president’s legal team, and Corallo resigned from his post. \nCorallo’s resignation followed the revelation that Donald Trump Jr., the president’s eldest son, had arranged a Trump Tower meeting in June 2016 between a Russian lawyer linked to the Kremlin and top campaign aides, including senior adviser Jared Kushner and campaign chairman Paul Manafort. Corallo had privately expressed frustration over the administration’s handling of reports about that meeting, the Journal previously reported.
