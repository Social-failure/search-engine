Brent hit $68.27 high last week,  \nTraders said the gains were due to a slight decline in the number of U.S. rigs drilling for new production, which eased by five in the week to January 5, to 742, according to data from oil services firm Baker Hughes.\nDespite this, U.S. production <C-OUT-T-EIA> is expected to break   very soon, largely thanks to soaring output from shale drillers. Only top producers Russia and Saudi Arabia produce more.\nRising U.S. production is the main factor countering production cuts led by the Middle East dominated   Countries (OPEC) and by Russia, which began   2018.\nStephen Innes, head of trading for Asia/Pacific at futures brokerage Oanda in Singapore, said \"the OPEC vs shale debate will rage\" this year, being a key price driving factor.\nHowever, Innes added that Middle East turmoil would remain a key focus for oil markets, which he warned had the potential to \"send oil prices rocketing higher.\"\n(Reporting by Henning Gloystein; editing by Richard Pullin)", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-08T04:11:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-08T05:55:24.025+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
