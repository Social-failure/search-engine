Brinks doesn’t wait for insurance to come back to them to reimburse their customers the way some competitors do,” another source said.\nThe company has been the victim of previous robberies, including one in 2013, where robbers dressed as police and armed with machineguns stole 120 parcels of diamonds worth $50 million from a van belonging to Brink's, at the runway of Brussels Airport. ( reut.rs/2CZnBgH )\nDespite the charge, Brink‘s, which specializes in secure transportation and handling of currency and valuables, said it continues to expect to post strong fourth-quarter results.\nBrink’s — whose customers include financial institutions, retailers and central banks — has a market cap of $3.95 billion.
