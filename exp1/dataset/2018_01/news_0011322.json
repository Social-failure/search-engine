Platelets are blood components that help the clotting process and stop bleeding.\nThe FDA said it expects to have a licensed product available by the end of the year.\nThe agency said it plans to review priority defense department products in a way that is similar to its current breakthrough designation program, which aims to speed products onto the market by relaxing certain clinical trial requirements and offering developers intensive FDA guidance.\nReporting by Toni Clarke in Washington; Editing by Bernadette Baum\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-16T18:08:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-16T18:23:15.011+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
