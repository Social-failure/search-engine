Tourists, residents and media gathered at vantage points to document the drama at the country’s most impressive volcano, which last erupted in 2014. \nMayon’s unrest has displaced about 75,500 people, the majority of whom are in evacuation centres, where children lined up for meals and parents braced for the possibility of a long stay away from home. \n“We are worried. We got used to the volcano, but we are still afraid,” said one evacuee, Irene Agao.

Because we never know what else the beautiful Mayon volcano will do.” \nGovernment offices and schools have been closed in 17 towns and municipalities and 66 flights have been cancelled in recent days. The authorities have warned residents far from the area to stay indoors to avoid heavy ash fall.

The provincial government has expanded the no-go area around the 2,462-metre (8,077-foot) Mayon to a radius of 9 kilometres. \nMayon was showing no signs of calming down soon, said Paul Alanis of the Philippine volcanology agency. \n“Right now our instruments around the volcano are measuring or detecting magma constantly coming up from below,” Alanis said. \n“So there’s always that danger, that this may still escalate.” Writing by Martin Petty; Editing by Clarence Fernandez", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-25T13:56:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-25T14:12:14.006+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
