It is possible that Third Point does not go public with any demands, one of the sources added. \nPinnacle and Third Point did not immediately respond to requests for comment. \nPinnacle shares ended trading up 4 percent on the news at $61.65, giving the company a market capitalization of around $7 billion. \nParsippany, New Jersey-based Pinnacle, whose brands include Duncan Hines baking products and Birds Eye frozen vegetables, has made a push toward healthier offerings, which are faster-growing and generate higher profit margins. \nPinnacle bought Boulder Brands Inc, owner of Udi’s Gluten Free Bread, for $975 million in 2016.
