He was speaking at the World Economic Forum in Davos on the eve of Trump's arrival at the Swiss resort.\nMnuchin's comments provided a fresh trigger for selling of the dollar, which has been on the back foot for months on the view that the U.S. Federal Reserve is no longer the only game in town when it comes to tighter monetary policy, as growth in other regions - in Europe in particular - picks up speed.\n\"The Mnuchin comments have helped feed it (the weaker dollar) a little bit, but they certainly didn't get the move going in the first place,\" said BMO Capital Markets currency strategist Stephen Gallo, in London.\n\"He gave the green light for benign neglect of the currency, in the short run.
