Schneiderman said the cut amounted to about 25 percent of the funding for New York’s Basic Health Program. \nAbout 800,000 people in both states are covered by the programs, according to the lawsuit. \nA spokesman for HHS could not immediately be reached for comment. \n(Corrects Basic Health Plan to Basic Health Program in paragraphs 3 and 4.)
