Another man, Richard Meltz, pleaded guilty to related charges. \nAll four men were registered users of DarkFetishNet, an online forum where tens of thousands of individuals share their musings about bizarre sexual fantasies, including necrophilia, according to court filings. \nAsch, who has been in custody since his arrest, purchased a collection of tools that he intended to use to kidnap and torture women, including a stun gun and leg spreaders, prosecutors said in court papers. \nAsch was caught after plotting with an undercover Federal Bureau of Investigation agent to kidnap a woman, who was also an undercover FBI agent.
