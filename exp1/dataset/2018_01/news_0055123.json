The organizational aspect is more important than the technical aspect,” he added.\nBefore FANR issues an operating licence, it not only needs to be confident that the reactor meets the highest technical and safety standards, but also that all Nawah’s staff have been properly trained in running the reactor under all circumstances and can handle any emergencies.\nThe four-reactor Barakah nuclear plant will have total capacity of 5,600 MW and will supply about a quarter of the UEA’s electricity when it is fully operational in 2020.\nIn September, the UAE said the second and third reactors were 86 percent and 76 percent complete, while the fourth was 54 percent done.\nReporting by Stanley Carvalho; Writing by Geert De Clercq; Editing by Susan Fenton\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-01-30T20:24:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-31T16:49:44.034+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
