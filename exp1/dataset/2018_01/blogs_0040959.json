Then you go to the office, or to work ... you come home, you're with the family or with the crew and hanging out,\" he says. \"You never have time for yourself.\" \nBut during his research, John discovered that successful people make an effort to pause and reflect. For example, John writes in \"Rise and Grind\" that musician Tyler Okonma, known as Tyler The Creator, does just that. \n\"Once when I called him, he'd just gone to sit in a tree for a couple of hours â€” just you know, to think,\" John writes in the book. \"He creates space for himself throughout the day, either [playing music] at his keyboard or up in a tree, for inspiration to find him.\" \nThe key is focusing on yourself and your goals. \n\"When you're out there answering everybody else, and doing everything everybody else wants, you're on defense. You're never on offense,\" John explains. \nInstead, make sure you find the time to ask yourself, \"Why am I getting up today?\" John says. \"What is the end purpose of today? What did I do today that I need to do better tomorrow? What did I not get to today? \nFor John, \"The way that you use the 24 hours in the day for the best is to find out what you want the most out of that day.\" Then work hard and accomplish it.
