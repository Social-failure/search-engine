Carrefour said yesterday it was seeking a partnership in China with Tencent in the face of competition from Amazon.\nReporting by Ina Zhou; Editing by Vincent Baby\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-01-24T16:45:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-25T13:15:31.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
