REUTERS/Ralph Orlowski/File Photo \nECB president Mario Draghi does not want to commit to an end date of the asset purchases right now, as keeping all options open might help to keep the euro’s value in check, Knot said. \n“That’s why we don’t commit to communicating now that it has to be done after September,” Knot, who is the Netherlands’ member of the ECB’s governing council, said. “But I think that’s where we’re going and that this sentiment is shared within the governing council.” \nEnding the asset purchases would give room to start looking at the possibility of increasing interest rates in 2019, Knot said. \nBut interest rates will probably only rise slowly and gradually in the coming years, he said. “Interest is mainly low because there are more people that want to save, than that want to invest. This will change as the economy grows, but that will take time.” Reporting by Bart Meijer.
