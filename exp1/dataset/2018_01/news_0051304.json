It shows that sober business is still prevailing and it does not change our project; we will go ahead full throttle,” Enders said.\n“The single largest market for the CSeries - as also for the (larger mainline) single-aisle - is the U.S. and it cannot be wrong to have a strong position in the U.S.”\nAirbus began producing some single-aisle A320-family jets, which compete with Boeing’s 737, in Mobile in September 2015, expanding its footprint beyond Europe and China. It plans a second line at the same plant for CSeries production.\nBoeing had argued that Bombardier dumped CSeries planes to Delta at prices below the cost of production, adding a new layer to existing trade friction between Boeing and the U.S. carrier.\n“I never heard of a good strategy that was conducted aggressively against one’s own customer and that is what I would take away from that. I don’t think that’s the way to do business,” Enders told Reuters.\nBoeing said it disagreed with Friday’s trade ruling and would review it when further details became available.\nReporting by Tim Hepher; Editing by Tom Brown and Richard Chang\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-01-27T06:37:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-27T07:51:27.022+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
