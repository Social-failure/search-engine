He had been dismissed as president by the Madrid government in October after organizing an illegal referendum and declaring independence. He fled to Belgium as the government laid sedition and rebellion charges against him and took direct control of the region.\n“I invite all the parties of this country to make the efforts in the way that could show positive results,” Puigdemont said.\nReporting by Teis Jensen and Stine Jacobsen; writing by Jacob Gronholt-Pedersen, Editing by Angus MacSwan\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-01-23T20:20:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-24T15:16:02.042+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
