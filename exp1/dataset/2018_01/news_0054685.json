Execute.LA was co-founded by Hank Leber and Wesley Clock and has employees located in the US and in Europe.\n\"These days it's hard for early stage and growing companies to find effective agency resources without having to commit to a year of service or paying high monthly fees,\" says Leber. \"With that in mind, we're thrilled to work with Hawke Media. This is a win for both Execute and for our clients, as they will get a great boost from the resources and expertise Hawke brings.\"\nWith this acquisition, Hawke Media continues its trend of investing in forward-thinking marketing practices and pushing the boundaries of what's possible for its clients. Hawke Media has integrated cutting edge technologies like Facebook Live and Instagram Live in its client strategies, and successfully experimented with physical retail concepts with The Nest, a co-retail space on Abbot Kinney in Venice, CA, that featured brands who lived exclusively online up to then.\nNotable Execute.LA clients coming to Hawke Media include Bruno Mars's SelvaRey Rum , and DrumChannel , the star-studded learning platform created by DW Drums Founder, Don Lombardi.\n\"Execute.LA has done some incredible work for a number of really impressive brands and we are excited to be bringing both the team and their clients into the Hawke Media family,\" says Erik Huberman, Founder & CEO of Hawke Media.\nFor more information about Hawke Media go to www.hawkemedia.com\nFor press contact:\nJanie LaFont\nPublic Relations\nHawke Media LLC\nDirect: 1 (310) 923-4378\nOffice: 1 (310) 451-7295\njanie@hawkemedia.com\nAbout Hawke Media\nHawke Media is a full-service Outsourced CMO headquartered in Santa Monica, CA.
