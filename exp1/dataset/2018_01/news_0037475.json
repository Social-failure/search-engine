I live in Mandalay, and it’s never happened like this before,” said Ven Ya Ma, 40, who led a group of about 30 monks from the city’s Ma Soe Yein monastery. \nVen Ya Ma opposed the actions of the Thai police against the Dhammakaya temple, which he said was only promoting Buddhism worldwide.

His whereabouts are unknown. \nDhammakaya claims millions of followers in Thailand and around the world, and in recent years has forged closer ties with Myanmar’s Buddhists. \nWirathu is a leading light in Ma Ba Tha, a religious group accused of whipping up anti-Muslim sentiment in Myanmar. \nA brutal military crackdown in Rakhine State, in western Myanmar, has driven about 650,000 Rohingya Muslims over the border into Bangladesh since August.
