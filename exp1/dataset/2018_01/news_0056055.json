(the “Company”) (OTCPink:BKOR), the parent company of Bank of Oak Ridge (the “Bank”), announced unaudited financial results for the fourth quarter and full year ending December 31, 2017.\n2017 Highlights\nEarnings per share of $1.22 for all of 2017, up 23 cents from 2016; earnings per share of $0.29 for the three months ended December 31, 2017, up 3 cents from 2016 - the enactment of the new federal tax law reduced 2017 annual and fourth quarter basic and diluted earnings per share by $0.10 Return on average common stockholders’ equity of 9.19% for all of 2017, compared to 8.79% for 2016; return on average common stockholders’ equity of 8.88% for the three months ended December 31, 2017, compared to 8.89% for 2016 Period end loans of $340.6 million, up 11.1% from December 31, 2016 Period end deposits of $361.7 million, up 9.8% from December 31, 2016 Period end noninterest-bearing deposits of $52.4 million, up 10.4% from December 31, 2016 Nonperforming assets of $2.8 million, down from $3.5 million at December 31, 2016 Repurchased 23,000 of the Company’s outstanding common shares The Company was recognized as one of top 200 Publicly Traded Community Banks and Thrifts by American Banker magazine (based on three-year average return on equity through December 31, 2016), was a winner of the Best Bank in the Triad for the sixth consecutive year and was a finalist for Triad Business Journal’s annual Best Places to Work awards\nTom Wayne, President and Chief Financial Officer, reported, “We were very pleased with loan and deposit growth in the fourth quarter and indeed, all of 2017. Our strong loan growth was due to increased production by our lending team, and our retail banking team has supported our loan growth, as total deposits also increased significantly in 2017. We have also been very pleased with the growth in noninterest-bearing deposits during 2017. Lastly, the recognition we received reflected our achievements in support of three very important stakeholder groups – our shareholders, our clients and our employees. I am very pleased with our overall performance in 2017 and thank our dedicated employees, our Board of Directors, and our clients for their continued support.”\nThe enactment of the new federal tax law, signed in late December 2017, negatively affected net income for the Company for the current quarter and year. The new tax rates become effective in 2018, but the 2017 enactment requires companies to revalue their deferred tax assets at the new tax rate in 2017. Accordingly, the Company recognized a $245,000 ($0.10 per basic and diluted share) charge to its deferred tax asset and a corresponding increase in income tax expense in the fourth quarter. Beginning in 2018, income tax expense will be positively affected by the substantial reduction in the corporate tax rate. The law provides for the corporate tax rate to be reduced from 35% to 21%.\nBank of Oak Ridge’s capital ratios remain strong and exceed all regulatory requirements at December 31, 2017. As of December 31, 2017, the Company’s stockholders’ equity was 7.2% of total assets, compared to 7.0% as of December 31, 2016. Book value per common share was $13.17 as of December 31, 2017, compared to $11.37 as of December 31, 2016.\nWith respect to the consolidated statement of operations for 2017 and 2016, net interest income was $14.5 million for all of 2017, which was an increase from $13.4 million during the same period in 2016. For 2017, the net interest margin was 3.66% compared to 3.84% for the same period in 2016, a decrease of 18 basis points.\nThe Company recorded a negative provision for loan losses of $60,000 for 2017, compared with a negative provision of $170,000 for 2016. The allowance for loan losses as a percentage of total loans was 1.04% at December 31, 2017 compared to 1.20% at December 31, 2016. The need to supplement the allowance for loan losses in 2017 was reduced by improvement in various quantitative and qualitative factors used in the determination of the allowance. Nonperforming assets represented 0.65% of total assets at December 31, 2017, compared to 0.89% at December 31, 2016.\nNoninterest income totaled $2.81 million in 2017, compared with $2.94 million in 2016, a decrease of $130,000 or 4.4%. The biggest noninterest income category contributing to the decline was decreases in gain on sale of securities, which declined $236,000 from 2016 to 2017.\nNoninterest expense totaled $13.10 million in 2017, compared with $12.74 million in 2016, an increase of $360,000 or 2.8%.\nAbout Oak Ridge Financial Services, Inc.\nOak Ridge Financial Services, Inc.
