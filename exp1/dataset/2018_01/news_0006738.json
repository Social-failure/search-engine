For the UK to look like a welcoming place is really important.”\nIndex Ventures partner Jan Hammer also said any post-Brexit restrictions on EU citizens movement would be detrimental.\n“Protecting the talent inflow is the key source of growth of start ups,” he said.\nAt the moment, however, London was setting the standard both in breadth and quality of start-ups, he said, noting that the city was home to role models such as Just Eat, King, a gaming company acquired by Activision Blizzard for $5.9 billion in 2015, and TransferWise.\n“In our portfolio roughly 50 companies of the 150 companies we have are headquartered in London, and there are about another 25 foreign companies that have set up in London,” he said.\n($1 = 0.7388 pounds)\nReporting by Paul Sandle Editing by Jeremy Gaunt.\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-05T02:06:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-05T02:20:14.058+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
