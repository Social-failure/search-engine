Bunge has declined to comment on ADM’s approach.\nAcquiring Minsa’s mills is “an important strategic step” to strengthen Bunge’s food and ingredients business, Todd Bastean, president Bunge North America, said in a statement. It makes Bunge a leading U.S. producer of corn flour used to make tortillas and expands the company’s reach into specialty products, such as organic corn flour, according to Bunge.\nBunge made the deal with Minsa after terminating an acquisition last year for a controlling stake in Grupo Minsa SAB de CV, which would have made Bunge the top grain miller in Mexico.\nIn September, Bunge bought a 70 percent stake in palm and tropical oils company IOI Loders Croklaan for nearly $1 billion - a move that industry experts said at the time would make it a tougher takeover target.
