(AP) — A half-ton of butter has been transformed into a sculpture celebrating Pennsylvania's dairy industry — and heralding the start of the state's 102nd Farm Show. \nAgriculture Secretary Russell Redding says the sculpture unveiled Thursday highlights the careers and roles the dairy industry plays in the state. \nIt features renderings of a cow and farmer, an agronomist, a milk processor and a shopper with a basket full of products. \nThe butter came from waste scrap butter that's not suitable for human consumption. After the show, the sculpture will be taken to a farm and turned into energy in a methane digester. \nThe Pennsylvania Farm Show is the nation's largest indoor agricultural event, featuring 12,000 competitive exhibits, more than 5,200 of which are animal competitions. \nIt runs Jan. 6 to Jan. 13.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-04T22:16:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-04T23:39:12.012+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
