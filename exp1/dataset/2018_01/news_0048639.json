He edged Bhuvneshwar Kumar (2-17) to wicketkeeper Parthiv Patel. \nBoth Rabada and Amla lived dangerously after that against a ball that was jagging in both directions as cracks on the pitch opened up in the Highveld sun. \nBut in the last half-hour of the session they were able to lift the scoring rate to put South Africa in control of a test that is unlikely to last the full five days. \nIndia had been dismissed for 187 on the opening day, a score batsman Cheteshwar Pujara (50) felt would have been worth 300 on a less seam-friendly surface. Rabada (3-39) was the pick of the home bowlers. \nSouth Africa won the opening two tests in Cape Town and Pretoria.
