It plans to launch the one-time treatment in March, charging an unprecedented $850,000.\nSpark will receive $105 million from Novartis and up to $65 million in milestone payments based on near-term European regulatory approval and initial sales in certain markets. Spark is also entitled to future royalties on net sales outside the United States.\nIn a statement, Spark said the deal leverages Novartis’ “large, existing commercial and medical infrastructure in ophthalmology, as well as its commitment to commercializing genetic-based medicines.”\nNovartis last year won U.S. approval for Kymriah, the first of a new type of potent gene-modifying immunotherapy for leukemia.\nLuxturna treats inherited retinal disease caused by defects in a gene known as RPE65, which affects between 1,000 and 2,000 people in the United States. It works by delivering by an eye injection viral vector particles containing a correct copy of the gene to retinal cells, restoring their ability to make a needed enzyme.\nReporting By Deena Beasley; Editing by Susan Thomas\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-01-25T06:24:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-25T13:05:58.011+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
