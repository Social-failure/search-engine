I have repeatedly made this clear to the Turkish government.”\nGermany and Turkey earlier this month resumed bilateral government consultations that had been suspended after Ankara’s arrest of German-Turkish journalist Deniz Yucel in February 2017. The Yucel case, however, remains a major irritant.\nReporting by Michael Nienaber and Andreas Rinke; Editing by Paul Carrel/Mark Heinrich\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-01-25T20:48:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-26T21:25:30.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
