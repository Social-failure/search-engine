We can’t be silent anymore,” Whittig said. “We’re still second-class citizens.” \nMarches were also held on Sunday in U.S. cities ranging from Miami to Knoxville as well as in London and Paris. \n\nA woman holds a sign encouraging voters during the Women's March rally in Las Vegas, Nevada, U.S. January 21, 2018. REUTERS/Steve Marcus March organizers said they designated Las Vegas as the site of the main event because of its status as a key political swing state, as well as to honor the victims of the mass shooting that killed 58 people and left more than 850 injured in October. \n“We want to let people to know Vegas is strong, and that’s really why they chose this place,” said Chris Giunchigliani, a Clark County commissioner and a Democratic candidate for Nevada governor. “It’s not only about empowering women and diversity.” \n\nSlideshow (6 Images) The event, held in a 40,000-seat football stadium, took on a festive atmosphere on a warm Sunday morning. \nDozens of volunteers fanned out looking to register people to vote among the thousands in attendance, as representatives of progressive Democratic candidates passed out literature. \nProtesters waved signs bearing slogans that included “Dissent is patriotic,” “Stand against racism,” “Make America sane again,” and “A shutdown means the president is weak.” \nSarah Casey and Leslie Morgan, both of Las Vegas, registered to vote at the stadium. \n“It’s partly about not liking Trump, but it’s also the GOP and how they’re just playing dirty politics,” Morgan said, referring to the Republicans. “It’s also all the things he’s rolling back that Obama did. Anything to do with the environment and anything to do with immigrants.” \nWriting by Frank McGurty; Editing by Jeffrey Benkoe and Daniel Wallis\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-21T23:43:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-22T00:01:02.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
