Canada reported similar health problems among its staff in Havana but, given the lack of evidence about the cause, has not shrunk its embassy. \nCordoba said Colombia was doing all it could to help Cuban families and has not rejected a single visa request from Cubans to travel to Bogota for interviews at the U.S. embassy. \nIn the line of applicants, Delio Sotolongo said he had come from the central province of Villa Clara, 250 km (155 miles) away. Given his monthly salary of $15 as an accountant, his wife in Miami was paying all the fees. \n“We need to be optimistic now,” the 50-year old said, “and think that we will finally manage to join our families again.” Reporting by Nelson Acosta in Havana; Additional Reporting by Grant Smith in New York; Writing by Sarah Marsh; Editing by Daniel Flynn and Rosalba O'Brien", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-01-19T19:12:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-19T13:34:38.013+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
