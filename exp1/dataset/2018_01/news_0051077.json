(OTCQX:STBI) announced net income of $3.2 million for 2017, and net income of $828,000 for the fourth quarter of 2017, Eric L. Eishen, President and CEO, announced today.\nSturgis Bancorp is the holding company for Sturgis Bank & Trust Company (Bank), and its subsidiaries Oakleaf Financial Services, Inc., Oak Mortgage, LLC, Oak Insurance Services, LLC, and Oak Title Services, LLC. Sturgis Bancorp provides a full array of trust, commercial and consumer banking services from 12 banking centers in Sturgis, Bangor, Bronson, Centreville, Climax, Colon, South Haven, Three Rivers and White Pigeon, MI. Oakleaf Financial Services offers a complete range of investment and financial-advisory services. Oak Mortgage offers residential mortgages in all markets of the Bank. Oak Insurance Services offers various competitive commercial and consumer insurance products. Oak Title Services offers commercial and consumer title insurance.\nKey Highlights for 2017:\nNet income for 2017 was $3.2 million, or $1.52 per share, compared to net income of $2.7 million, or $1.28 per share, in 2016. The Bank capital ratios exceeded “well-capitalized” requirements and ended 2017 with Tier 1 capital at 8.35% of average assets and 12.55% of risk-weighted assets. Total capital at December 31, 2017 was 13.69% of risk-weighted assets. The allowance for loan losses decreased to 1.09% of total (gross) loans from 1.20% at the end of 2016, primarily due to improvements in asset quality and loss experience. Net charge offs in 2017 were ($43,000), compared to $329,000 in 2016.\nYear 2017 vs. 2016 - Net income for the year ended December 31, 2017 increased to $3.2 million, or $1.52 per share from net income of $2.7 million, or $1.28 per share, for 2016. Net interest income increased 5.1% to $12.9 million, from $12.3 million for 2016. The increase in net interest income is primarily due to growth in loans.\nThe average rate paid on interest-bearing liabilities increased to 0.70% in 2017 from 0.65% in 2016. Average interest-earning assets increased to $361.3 million in 2017 from $342.7 million in 2016. The tax equivalent net interest margin was 3.76% in both 2017 and 2016.\nThe provision for loan losses was ($213,000) for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to $357,000 for the year ended December 31, 2016. The provision for loan losses was based upon management’s assessment of relevant factors, including types and amounts of non-performing loans, historical and anticipated loss experience on such types of loans, and economic conditions. Loans charged off during 2017, net of recoveries, were ($43,000), compared to $329,000 in 2016.\nNoninterest income was $5.5 million in 2017, compared to $5.2 million in 2016. The Bank increased service charges on deposit accounts to $1.4 million in 2017 from $1.0 million in 2016. The Bank also realized $258,000 net gain on cash flow hedges in 2017, compared to $99,000 in 2016.\nNoninterest expense was $15.3 million in 2017, compared to $13.8 million in 2016. Salaries and employee benefits increased $726,000. This increase is primarily due to wages, health insurance benefits and pension expense increases. The Bank realized $441,000 losses on sales of available-for-sale securities in 2017, compared to net gain of ($1,000) in 2016. The additional pension expense and loss on sale of securities were realized to manage the tax rate change enacted in December 2017. Management actively minimizes noninterest expense, although certain noninterest expenses are outside of Management’s direct control.\nTotal assets increased to $414.4 million at December 31, 2017 from $398.6 million at December 31, 2016, primarily in loans. Net loans increased $13.7 million, to $280.6 million at December 31, 2017. Most of the net loan growth was in home equity lines of credit, commercial real estate loans, and nonresidential construction loans.\nDeposits were $337.1 million at December 31, 2017 compared to $297.8 million at December 31, 2016, an increase of $39.3 million. Interest-bearing deposits increased to $255.5 million at December 31, 2017 from $232.3 million at December 31, 2016. Brokered certificates of deposit increased to $43.5 million at December 31, 2017 from $9.6 million at December 31, 2016, as the Bank replaced borrowed funds with brokered deposits. Non-brokered jumbo certificates reduced slightly to $12.9 million at December 31, 2017 from $13.0 million at December 31, 2016. The Bank uses brokered and jumbo certificates as sources of liquidity. Bank management is actively attempting to increase core deposit account relationships. Transaction savings accounts and checking accounts provide relatively inexpensive funding for future growth, compared to alternative certificates of deposit and borrowed funds at higher interest rates. The Bank offers competitive rates on its time deposits and uses brokered certificates or borrowed funds, when that strategy is expected to enhance net interest income.\nFederal Home Loan Bank advances and other borrowings decreased $26.7 million. Matured advances were refinanced with new brokered deposits.\nThe stockholders’ equity of Bancorp was $37.3 million at December 31, 2017 compared to $34.7 million at December 31, 2016, an increase of $2.5 million, or 7.3%. The primary component of this increase was retained earnings. Cash dividends of $873,000, or $0.42 per share, were paid in 2016. The stockholders’ equity was 8.99% of total assets at December 31, 2017. Book value per share increased to $17.78 at December 31, 2016 from $16.65 at December 31, 2016.\nThe regular quarterly dividend for Bancorp was maintained at $0.12 per share in 2017, for $0.48 per share total dividends, compared to $0.42 per share in 2016. The increases was well supported with core earnings improvements and credit quality improvements in recent years, and remains in line with the Company's historical payout ratio.\nFourth Quarter of 2017 vs. 2016 - Net income for the quarter ended December 31, 2017 increased to $828,000, or $0.40 per share, from $695,000, or $0.33 per share, for the fourth quarter of 2016. The primary component of the increase was fourth quarter 2017 benefit from federal income taxes of ($548,000), compared to provision of $157,000 in the fourth quarter of 2016. The Bank revalued its net deferred tax positions in the fourth quarter of 2017, using the lower corporate tax rate. Because the Bank has greater deferred tax liabilities than deferred tax assets, the net of revaluations were a benefit to the Bank.\nNet interest income increased $202,000, to $3.3 million in the fourth quarter of 2017. The increase is primarily due to growth in average interest-earning assets. The tax-equivalent net interest margin increased to 3.79 in the fourth quarter of 2017 from 3.68% in the last quarter of 2016, primarily due to growth in loans and market rate increases.\nNet charge-offs for the fourth quarter of 2017 were $5,000, compared to $107,000 a year ago. The Company recorded ($31,000) provision for loan losses in the fourth quarter of 2017, compared to $73,000 for the same quarter of 2016.\nNoninterest income increased $32,000 in the fourth quarter of 2017 to $1.3 million. The primarily component of noninterest income was commission income, which increased $63,000. The company recorded $99,000 net gain on cash flow hedges in the fourth quarter of 2016.\nNoninterest expense increased $855,000 in the fourth quarter of 2017, primarily due to losses on sale of available-for-sale securities and tax strategies implemented in response to the reduction in corporate tax rates for 2018.\nThis release contains statements that constitute forward-looking statements.
