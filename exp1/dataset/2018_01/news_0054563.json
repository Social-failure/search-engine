REUTERS/Bobby Yip \nThe Asian financial hub has been governed under a “one country, two systems” formula since its return from British rule in 1997, allowing autonomy and freedom not enjoyed in mainland China, such as an independent judiciary and limited democracy. \nThose freedoms, and Hong Kong’s relationship with Beijing, are enshrined in the territory’s mini-constitution known as the Basic Law that guarantees its capitalist way of life for 50 years. \nThe ban decision sparked anger among opposition leaders, who led a crowd of at least 2,000 people in protest against “political censorship” outside government headquarters on Sunday. \n“You are shutting the gates to us running for office,” said a visibly upset Wong, just a few days after he was released from prison on bail pending appeal. “We will open other gates to find a path for Hong Kong’s democratic movement.” \nCases before Chow’s involved radical candidates actively demanding independence or legislators who delivered profanity-laden oaths of office, but her disqualification effectively thwarts her Demosisto party, seen as an emerging outlet for the city’s young people. \nIn calling for “self-determination”, Demosisto leaders say they are not advocating independence but instead demanding a referendum on Hong Kong’s future after 2047, which would include independence among other options.
