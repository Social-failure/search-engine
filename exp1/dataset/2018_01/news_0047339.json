Results for each of these periods were affected by certain previously announced operating charges. Net income-wise, however, the charges were outpaced by greater than average realized gains from sales of investment securities. Additionally, 2017 net operating income and net income were influenced by year-end 2017 deferred income tax adjustments emanating from recently enacted changes in U.S. Federal income tax rates. The separate and aggregate effects of these matters on year-over-year comparisons of segmented and consolidated earnings are shown in the three tables following the Financial Highlights immediately below.\nFinancial Highlights (a)\nQuarters Ended December 31,\nYears Ended December 31,\n2017\n2016\nChange\n2017\n2016\nChange\nOperating revenues:\nGeneral insurance\n$\n904.0\n$\n847.6\n6.7%\n$\n3,531.6\n$\n3,354.7\n5.3%\nTitle insurance\n626.0\n628.9\n-0.5\n2,325.0\n2,244.1\n3.6\nCorporate and other\n12.4\n12.7\n-1.9\n50.1\n35.4\n41.3\nSubtotal\n1,542.6\n1,489.3\n3.6\n5,906.8\n5,634.3\n4.8\nRFIG run-off business\n29.5\n44.6\n-34.0\n144.6\n193.2\n-25.2\nTotal\n$\n1,572.1\n$\n1,533.9\n2.5%\n$\n6,051.5\n$\n5,827.6\n3.8%\nPretax operating income (loss):\nGeneral insurance\n$\n124.1\n$\n76.8\n61.5%\n$\n340.3\n$\n319.9\n6.4%\nTitle insurance\n64.2\n85.6\n-25.0\n237.1\n210.2\n12.8\nCorporate and other\n(2.5)\n4.1\n-162.3\n9.9\n13.0\n-24.1\nSubtotal\n185.8\n166.7\n11.5\n587.3\n543.3\n8.1\nRFIG run-off business\n14.8\n9.3\n58.9\n(73.5)\n69.8\n-205.4\nTotal\n200.6\n176.0\n14.0\n513.8\n613.1\n-16.2\nPretax realized investment gains (losses):\nFrom sales\n154.0\n14.7\nN/M\n211.6\n77.8\n172.0\nFrom impairments\n-\n-\n-\n-\n(4.9)\n100.0\nRealized investment gains (losses)\n154.0\n14.7\nN/M\n211.6\n72.8\n190.4\nConsolidated pretax income (loss)\n354.7\n190.7\n85.9\n725.4\n686.0\n5.7\nIncome taxes (credits)\n55.0\n58.7\n-6.3\n164.8\n219.0\n-24.7\nNet income (loss)\n$\n299.6\n$\n131.9\n127.0%\n$\n560.5\n$\n466.9\n20.0%\nComponents of diluted earnings per share (see analysis on pages 2 - 4):\nNet operating income (loss):\nGeneral insurance\n$\n0.05\n$\n0.19\n-73.7%\n$\n0.57\n$\n0.76\n-25.0%\nTitle insurance\n0.15\n0.19\n-21.1\n0.53\n0.46\n15.2\nCorporate and other\n(0.07)\n0.03\nN/M\n-\n0.09\n-100.0\nSubtotal\n0.13\n0.41\n-68.3\n1.10\n1.31\n-16.0\nRFIG run-off business\n0.20\n0.02\nN/M\n0.01\n0.15\n-93.3\nTotal\n0.33\n0.43\n-23.3\n1.11\n1.46\n-24.0\nNet realized investment gains (losses)\n0.68\n0.03\nN/M\n0.81\n0.16\nN/M\nNet income (loss)\n$\n1.01\n$\n0.46\n119.6%\n$\n1.92\n$\n1.62\n18.5%\nCash dividends declared per share (b)\n$\n1.1900\n$\n0.1875\nN/M\n$\n1.7600\n$\n0.7500\n134.7%\nEnding book value per share\n$\n17.72\n$\n17.16\n3.3%\nN/M = Not meaningful / (a) Unaudited; All amounts in this report are stated in millions except per share data and percentages. / (b) A special cash dividend of $1.00 per share was declared in late December 2017 in addition to the regular quarterly dividend payment of $0.1900 per share.\nThe tables on pages 3 and 4 set forth the effects of certain previously announced 2017 charges which do not normally occur but are properly includable in the determination of net operating income and net income.

Management uses operating income, a non-GAAP financial measure, to evaluate and better explain operating performance, believing that the measure enhances an understanding of Old Republic's core business results. Operating income, however, does not replace GAAP net income as a measure of total profitability.\nThe recognition of realized investment gains or losses can be highly discretionary due to such factors as the timing of individual securities sales, the recording of estimated losses from write-downs of impaired securities, tax-planning and tax rate considerations, and changes in investment management judgments regarding the direction of securities markets or the future prospects of individual investees or industry sectors.\nIn recent years, asset management operations have to a large extent been oriented toward an enhancement of income from interest and dividends to counter a perniciously low yield environment. The strategy has led to a minimization of non-income producing or low-yielding securities. Proceeds from such securities' sales and maturities, as well as newly investable funds have largely been directed to purchases of higher yielding common shares of American companies with distinguished long-term records of earnings and dividend growth. More recently, the Company has allotted greater investable funds to tax-exempt issues which generally provide pretax yields lower than those of fully taxable corporate or U.S. Government fixed maturity securities but tend to generate better post-tax yields. The latter approach may be reconsidered, however, in light of the newly established U.S. Federal income tax rates that took effect on January 1, 2018.\nThe Company reported net realized investment gains of $154.0 in the fourth quarter 2017 compared to $14.7 in the same period of 2016. The gains, substantially higher than those realized in comparable periods in recent years, stem from managed sales of investment portfolio securities whose values had risen to higher than expected levels over the course of 2017's strong securities market. For the year 2017, net realized gains were $211.6 while gains for the year 2016 totaled $72.8. The net-of-tax proceeds from gross securities sales of $464.5 in 2017's final quarter have been reinvested in common stocks expected to return moderately higher dividend income than the securities that were sold. For the fourth quarter and year 2017, net realized investment gains (losses) includes $104.9 of deferred income tax credits to adjust to the new 21% tax rate pertaining to unrealized gains (losses) as of December 31, 2017. Deferred income taxes on unrealized gains (losses) would normally be a part of the statement of comprehensive income rather than the income statement.\nBeginning in 2018, in pursuance of recently established rules of the Financial Accounting Standards Board, the Company will include the market-driven changes of its equity investments' valuations in periodic income statements. The inclusion of such unrealized gains or losses is likely to produce greater period-to-period fluctuations in reported net income particularly at times of significant instability or volatility in the securities markets. The change, however, will have no impact on the conduct of the Company's business or evaluation of its core operating performance, nor on the determination of GAAP shareholders' equity at any point in time.\nGeneral Insurance Results – The table below shows the major elements affecting this segment's performance for each of the periods reported upon.\nGeneral Insurance Group\nQuarters Ended December 31,\nYears Ended December 31,\n2017\n2016\nChange\n2017\n2016\nChange\nNet premiums earned\n$\n797.1\n$\n743.5\n7.2%\n$\n3,110.8\n$\n2,936.3\n5.9%\nNet investment income\n80.9\n78.5\n3.0\n318.9\n312.1\n2.2\nOther income\n26.0\n25.6\n1.6\n101.8\n106.2\n-4.1\nOperating revenues\n904.0\n847.6\n6.7\n3,531.6\n3,354.7\n5.3\nBenefits and claim costs (a)\n524.9\n547.5\n-4.1\n2,234.4\n2,143.1\n4.3\nSales and general expenses\n239.2\n208.3\n14.8\n893.8\n833.9\n7.2\nInterest and other costs\n15.6\n14.8\n5.8\n62.9\n57.6\n9.2\nTotal operating expenses\n779.9\n770.7\n1.2\n3,191.3\n3,034.7\n5.2\nPretax operating income (loss) (b)\n$\n124.1\n$\n76.8\n61.5%\n$\n340.3\n$\n319.9\n6.4%\nBenefit and claim ratio\n65.9%\n73.6%\n71.8%\n73.0%\nExpense ratio\n26.8\n24.6\n25.5\n24.8\nComposite underwriting ratio\n92.7%\n98.2%\n97.3%\n97.8%\n(a)\nGeneral insurance pretax results for the quarter and year ended December 31, 2017 include hurricane-related claim costs currently estimated at $(12.0) and $8.0, respectively.\n(b)\nIn connection with the run-off mortgage guaranty (\"MI\") and consumer credit indemnity (\"CCI\") combination, $1.8 and $(121.1) of pretax operating gains (losses) for the fourth quarter and year 2017, and $(7.5) and $(33.8) for the same periods of 2016, respectively, were retained by certain general insurance companies pursuant to various quota share and stop loss reinsurance agreements. All of these amounts, however, have been reclassified such that 100% of the CCI run-off business is reported in the RFIG run-off segment.\nPositive general insurance earned premiums trends throughout 2017 were unevenly distributed among various insurance coverages and sources of business. Gains were registered most prominently in commercial automobile (trucking), risk management and national accounts, home and auto warranty, and in a new underwriting facility established in early 2015. On the other hand, premium growth was constrained by low volume in a large account contractors book of business faced with a particularly competitive market place, and by reduced opportunities in gas and oil energy services and several smaller industry sectors.\nNet investment income edged up during 2017 on the strength of a greater invested asset base, while the yield environment continued to exhibit lower returns on both fixed maturity and high quality equity securities.\nThe ratio of claims and related settlement costs to earned premiums improved in the final quarter and full year of 2017 compared with 2016 periods. While current accident year claim ratios reflected moderate year-over-year declines, these were affected by moderately favorable (unfavorable) developments of prior years' reserves of 2.4 and (0.7) percentage points in 2017's fourth quarter and twelve month periods, respectively. 2017's unfavorable developments for the year were concentrated in the Company's largest insurance coverages of workers' compensation and general liability which were partially offset by favorable development trends in commercial automobile (trucking). For the respective 2016 periods, the claim and related settlement costs ratios include unfavorable development of 1.7 and 0.3 percentage points. Expense ratios for the 2017 periods reported upon were slightly above the range of a long-term operating objective of 23% to 25% due to the previously announced charges for estimated employee incentive awards.\nQuarterly and even annual claim provisions and the trends they display may not be particularly meaningful in Old Republic's long-term liability insurance mix of business. Absent significant economic and insurance industry dislocations in the foreseeable future, it is currently anticipated that reported claim ratios could range within targeted averages in the high 60% to low 70% levels. The current mix of business should result in expense ratios within the aforementioned range.\nTitle Insurance Results – 2017 pretax operating income gained for the year as both revenues and claim costs extended the favorable trends of recent years.\nTitle Insurance Group\nQuarters Ended December 31,\nYears Ended December 31,\n2017\n2016\nChange\n2017\n2016\nChange\nNet premiums and fees earned\n$\n616.6\n$\n619.4\n-0.5%\n$\n2,287.2\n$\n2,206.6\n3.6%\nNet investment income\n9.3\n9.2\n1.7\n37.3\n36.2\n3.1\nOther income\n-\n0.2\n-89.3\n0.5\n1.2\n-56.4\nOperating revenues\n626.0\n628.9\n-0.5\n2,325.0\n2,244.1\n3.6\nClaim costs\n(13.7)\n2.5\nN/M\n20.8\n84.3\n-75.3\nSales and general expenses\n574.4\n538.8\n6.6\n2,060.1\n1,941.8\n6.1\nInterest and other costs\n1.1\n1.8\n-38.0\n6.9\n7.6\n-8.6\nTotal operating expenses\n561.8\n543.2\n3.4\n2,087.9\n2,033.8\n2.7\nPretax operating income (loss)\n$\n64.2\n$\n85.6\n-25.0%\n$\n237.1\n$\n210.2\n12.8%\nClaim ratio\n-2.2%\n0.4%\n0.9%\n3.8%\nExpense ratio\n93.1\n86.9\n90.0\n87.9\nComposite underwriting ratio\n90.9%\n87.3%\n90.9%\n91.7%\nThe continuation of a generally positive mortgage rate environment and reasonably strong housing and commercial property markets were major factors in the year-over-year gain in premiums and fees for 2017. On the expense side of the ledger, claim costs were lower in the face of declining claims activity since the Great Recession years. Favorable developments of reserves established in prior years further reduced the claim ratio by 6.4 and 3.3 percentage points in 2017's fourth quarter and full year, respectively. For the related periods of 2016, the ratios were reduced by 3.8 and 1.1 percentage points, respectively. Except for the effect of aforementioned additions of employee incentive awards in the final quarter of 2017, the expense ratio for the periods reported upon remained generally aligned with earned premiums and fees levels.\nRFIG Run-off Business Results – Overall pretax operating results for 2017 periods were most significantly impacted by additional claim and related expense provisions ($130.0 million) applicable to final settlements and probable dispositions of all known litigated and other claim costs incurred during the Great Recession years and their aftermath.\nRFIG Run-off Business\nQuarters Ended December 31,\nYears Ended December 31,\n2017\n2016\nChange\n2017\n2016\nChange\nA.

These costs, registered in the third quarter of the year, apply to the final settlements and probable dispositions of all known litigated and other claim costs incurred by the Company's run-off Financial Indemnity business during the Great Recession years and their aftermath. Of the total charge, $23.0 related to mortgage guaranty claim costs and $107.0 was attributable to additional claim provisions in the consumer credit indemnity run-off business.\n(b)\nIn connection with the run-off mortgage guaranty (\"MI\") and consumer credit indemnity (\"CCI\") combination, $1.8 and $(121.1) of pretax operating gains (losses) for the fourth quarter and year 2017, and $(7.5) and $(33.8) for the same periods of 2016, respectively, were retained by certain general insurance companies pursuant to various quota share and stop loss reinsurance agreements. All of these amounts, however, have been reclassified such that 100% of the CCI run-off business is reported in the RFIG run-off segment.\nConsistent with a run-off operating mode, further declines of earned premiums were posted by the combined MI and CCI lines. MI investment income was also lower as reduced premium volume and on-going claim payments effected downward pressures on the invested asset base.\nThe declining premium base led to a higher claim ratio for 2017 though current accident year reported claim costs, absent the MI charges referred to below, were relatively level in comparison to the related periods of 2016. Reductions in the provision for current year losses stemming from a continuing drop in newly reported delinquencies as well as improving cure rates resulted in favorable developments of previously established claim reserves. The developments led to reductions of the claim ratios by 32.6 and 38.3 percentage points in the fourth quarter and all of 2017, respectively. In the same respective periods of 2016, the claim ratio reductions amounted to 24.7 and 39.8 percentage points. As already noted however, MI claim costs for 2017 rose most significantly due to a third quarter additional claim provision of $23.0 which added 20.9 percentage points to the claim ratio for the year. MI operating costs and the related expense ratios were also impacted by costs stemming from the partial termination of a leased facility in early 2017.\n2017 year-over-year operating performance comparisons for the CCI portion of the Run-off business were most significantly affected by the aforementioned claim provision of $107.0. Excluding this charge, CCI's pretax operating results would have reflected a minor improvement for the year as a whole.\nCorporate and Other Operations – The combination of a small life and accident insurance business and the net costs associated with operations of the parent holding company and its internal corporate services subsidiaries usually produce highly variable results. Earnings variations posted by these elements of Old Republic's business stem from volatility inherent to the small scale of the life and accident insurance line, changes in net investment income, and net interest expenses related to external and intra-system financing arrangements. Year-over-year comparisons were particularly affected by the previously announced $9.5 charge from a periodic review and resulting update of previously established estimates of future interest rates, mortality, and persistency applicable to largely inactive life insurance products in the fourth quarter 2017. The dynamic period-to-period interplay of these various operating elements is summarized in the following table:\nCorporate and Other Operations\nQuarters Ended\nDecember 31,\nYears Ended\nDecember 31,\n2017\n2016\n2017\n2016\nNet premiums earned\n$\n4.3\n$\n6.1\n$\n18.8\n$\n20.1\nNet investment income\n8.1\n6.5\n31.4\n15.4\nOther income\n-\n-\n(0.1)\n(0.1)\nOperating revenues\n12.4\n12.7\n50.1\n35.4\nBenefits and claim costs\n12.3\n4.9\n25.8\n17.7\nInsurance expenses\n1.3\n1.2\n8.2\n7.8\nCorporate, interest and other expenses - net\n1.4\n2.3\n6.1\n(3.2)\nTotal operating expenses\n15.0\n8.5\n40.2\n22.4\nPretax operating income (loss)\n$\n(2.5)\n$\n4.1\n$\n9.9\n$\n13.0\nConsolidated Results – The above summarized operating results of Old Republic's segmented business are reflected in the following consolidation of accounts.\nORI Consolidated\nQuarters Ended December 31,\nYears Ended December 31,\n2017\n2016\nChange\n2017\n2016\nChange\nNet premiums and fees earned\n$\n1,442.4\n$\n1,408.1\n2.4%\n$\n5,539.7\n$\n5,333.2\n3.9%\nNet investment income\n103.7\n100.0\n3.7\n409.4\n387.0\n5.8\nOther income\n25.9\n25.8\n0.6\n102.2\n107.3\n-4.7\nOperating revenues\n1,572.1\n1,533.9\n2.5\n6,051.5\n5,827.6\n3.8\nBenefits and claim costs\n534.1\n585.7\n-8.8\n2,478.8\n2,347.9\n5.6\nSales and general expenses\n822.6\n755.9\n8.8\n2,995.7\n2,816.3\n6.4\nInterest and other costs\n14.7\n16.2\n-9.2\n63.0\n50.2\n25.5\nTotal operating expenses\n1,371.5\n1,357.9\n1.0\n5,537.7\n5,214.5\n6.2\nPretax operating income (loss)\n200.6\n176.0\n14.0\n513.8\n613.1\n-16.2\nIncome taxes (credits)\n106.0\n53.6\n97.8\n195.7\n193.5\n1.1\nNet operating income (loss)\n94.5\n122.3\n-22.7\n318.0\n419.6\n-24.2\nRealized investment gains (losses)\n154.0\n14.7\nN/M\n211.6\n72.8\n190.4\nIncome taxes (credits) on realized investment gains (losses) (a)\n(51.0)\n5.1\nN/M\n(30.8)\n25.5\n-220.8\nNet realized investment gains (losses)\n205.1\n9.5\nN/M\n242.4\n47.3\nN/M\nNet income (loss)\n$\n299.6\n$\n131.9\n127.0%\n$\n560.5\n$\n466.9\n20.0%\nBenefit and claim ratio\n37.0%\n41.6%\n44.7%\n44.0%\nExpense ratio\n55.0\n51.6\n52.0\n50.6\nComposite underwriting ratio\n92.0%\n93.2%\n96.7%\n94.6%\nConsolidated operating cash flow\n$\n452.8\n$\n637.3\n-29.0%\n(a)\nIncludes $104.9, for the fourth quarter and year 2017, of deferred income tax credits to the new 21% tax rate of 2018 pertaining to unrealized gains (losses) as of December 31, 2017.

Excluding inherently negative operating cash flows in the MI and CCI run-off business, these amounts would be $765.3 and $739.8, respectively.\nThe sum-total of Old Republic's segmented results is represented by the following major components of pretax consolidated income:\nQuarters Ended December 31,\nYears Ended December 31,\nPretax operating income:\n2017\n2016\nChange\n2017\n2016\nChange\nUnderwriting and related services:\nAll segments except RFIG\n$\n102.0\n$\n88.6\n15.2%\n$\n262.6\n$\n229.7\n14.4%\nRFIG run-off\n9.5\n3.6\n161.0\n(95.2)\n46.6\nN/M\nSubtotal\n111.5\n92.2\n21.0\n167.3\n276.3\n-39.4\nNet investment income\n103.7\n100.0\n3.7\n409.4\n387.0\n5.8\nInterest and other costs\n(14.7)\n(16.2)\n-9.2\n(63.0)\n(50.2)\n25.5\nTotal\n200.6\n176.0\n14.0\n513.8\n613.1\n-16.2\nRealized investment gains(losses)\n154.0\n14.7\nN/M\n211.6\n72.8\n190.4\nConsolidated pretax income\n$\n354.7\n$\n190.7\n85.9%\n$\n725.4\n$\n686.0\n5.7%\nCash, Invested Assets, and Shareholders' Equity – The table below shows Old Republic's consolidated cash and invested assets as well as the shareholders' equity balance at the dates shown.\nCash, Invested Assets, and Shareholders' Equity (a)\n% Change\nDecember 31,\nDec.

As a result, previously reported book values per share decreased by $0.04 per share for the years ended 2015 and 2016.\nOld Republic's invested assets are managed in consideration of enterprise-wide risk management objectives. Most importantly, these are intended to ensure solid funding of the insurance subsidiaries' long-term obligations to policyholders and other beneficiaries, as well as the long-term stability of the subsidiaries' capital accounts. To this end, the investment portfolio contains no significant insurance risk-correlated asset exposures to real estate, mortgage-backed securities, collateralized debt obligations (\"CDO's\"), derivatives, hybrid securities, or illiquid private equity and hedge fund investments. Moreover, the Company does not engage in hedging or securities lending transactions, nor does it invest in securities whose values are predicated on non-regulated financial instruments exhibiting amorphous or unfunded counter-party risk attributes.\nAs of December 31, 2017, the consolidated investment portfolio reflected an allocation of approximately 75% to fixed-maturity and short-term investments, and 25% to equities. Investments in high quality, dividend-paying equity securities have been singularly emphasized since 2013, and the asset quality of the fixed maturity portfolio has remained at high levels.\nChanges in shareholders' equity per share are reflected in the following table.
