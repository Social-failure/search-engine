The S&P 500 lost 24.69 points, or 0.87 percent, to 2,828.84 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 49.97 points, or 0.67 percent, to 7,416.54.\nThe pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index lost 0.73 percent and MSCI’s gauge of stocks across the globe shed 0.86 percent.\nBenchmark 10-year notes fell 4/32 in price to yield 2.7142 percent.\nThe dollar reversed Monday’s gains. After six straight weekly declines, the dollar index was on track to fall about 3.4 percent for the month, which would be its biggest monthly fall since March 2016.\nThe dollar index fell 0.03 percent, with the euro up 0.07 percent to $1.239. The Japanese yen strengthened 0.06 percent versus the greenback at 108.92 per dollar.\nBrent crude futures fell 90 cents to $68.56 a barrel, while West Texas Intermediate futures slid $1.28 to $64.28 a barrel.\nExpectations for U.S. crude inventories to rise for the first time in 11 weeks may also be keeping oil under pressure, according to a preliminary poll by Reuters on Monday.\n“The global trend seems to be indicating more oil is coming into the market despite best efforts by the Saudis and Russians to curtail output,” said John Kilduff, partner at Again Capital LLC in New York.\nReporting by Herbert Lash; Editing by Nick Zieminski\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-01-31T01:15:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-31T04:38:20.021+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
