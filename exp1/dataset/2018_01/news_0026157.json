I don’t know if he will be back next week, but we hope he’ll be back soon. Thursday is possible.” \nCoutinho spent six months on loan at Espanyol from Inter Milan in the latter half of the 2011-12 season. \nTriple cup holders Barca trail their cross-town rivals in the tie after losing the first leg away from home 1-0. \nHowever, they could further tighten their grip at the top of La Liga if they beat Betis, which would give them an 11-point advantage over Atletico Madrid, who were held to a 1-1 draw at home to Girona on Saturday.
