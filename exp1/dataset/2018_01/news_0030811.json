Everybody has learned their own lessons. \n“I don’t think there are any grudges felt from any party and I’ll just apply myself as honestly as I can every day, like I would for any manager here. If I get the chance to play I will give everything I can to impress him.” \nStoke have given Ireland a short-term contract until the end of the season to prove his fitness and help the 18th-placed club avoid relegation. \nHe created several chances for Stoke in the first half of 3-0 league defeat at Manchester United on Monday in what was his first top flight start since April 2015. \n“That was my first start in the Premier League in almost three years and to make it at Old Trafford is always going to be tough – but I‘m really, really happy to have done it,” Ireland added. \n“My contract runs out in the summer so there is a lot for me to play for to impress Stoke, the fans, the new manager, the board – at the very least I have to showcase what I can do in the next 15 games.” Reporting by Hardik Vyas in Bengaluru; editing by Amlan Chakraborty", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-18T10:26:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-18T10:47:26.025+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
