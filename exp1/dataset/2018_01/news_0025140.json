But he added there was a growing market for local buyers too with condominium sales in the $22,000 to $90,000 range. \n“The reality is that Phnom Penh needs more homes to cater for the middle income earner,” he said. \nPolitical turbulence last year had little impact on investment, property specialists said. Cambodia’s main opposition party was banned after the arrest of its leader, Kem Sokha, on treason charges he says were politically motivated to eliminate him from an election in 2018. \nDespite criticism from Western donors of Prime Minister Hun Sen’s government for its moves against the opposition, China has stood beside Cambodia. Chinese Prime Minister Li Peng signed a raft of new aid and investment deals in Phnom Penh last week. \n“Chinese investors are not concerned about the up coming election,” O‘Sullivan said. \nThere has been little open opposition to the growing Chinese presence in Cambodia. \nBut in a rare sign of friction, Cambodian police arrested 74 Chinese nationals who had been working on a condominium project in Phnom Penh. Uk Heisela, chief of investigation at the immigration department, said they were suspected of working without permits and staying illegally.
