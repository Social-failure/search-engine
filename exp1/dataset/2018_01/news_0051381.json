The judiciary has confirmed two such deaths but said these were cases of suicide. Activists say up to five people died in detention and have called for an independent investigation.\nReporting by Bozorgmehr Sharafedin; Editing by Raissa Kasolowsky\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-30T11:22:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-30T11:39:27.018+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
