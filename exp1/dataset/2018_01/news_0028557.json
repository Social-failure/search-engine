Growth was also strong with the support of government incentives and tax reductions,” said Haluk Burumcekci, an economist who runs Burumcekci Consulting in Istanbul.\n“However, I expect growth to ...come down toward 4 percent in 2018 due to a slowdown in the credit growth rate and base effects. Additional incentives by the government may lift (this)”\nAfter hitting a 14-year high just below 13 percent in November, Turkey’s inflation completed the year at 11.92 percent in December, data showed.\nThe Reuters poll predicted inflation would remain high but fall to 9.3 percent by the end of this year and 8.5 percent by end-2019, above the government’s targets of 7.0 percent and 6.0 percent respectively.\n(For other stories from the Reuters global long-term economic outlook polls package see)\nReporting and polling by Sarmista Sen and Nevzat Devranoglu; Writing by Ezgi Erkoyun; editing by John Stonestreet\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-01-18T16:28:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-18T12:29:07.053+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
