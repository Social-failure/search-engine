They may choose to listen to messages left by others on subjects such as new job openings, or they can leave a message themselves.\nIf they choose to report abuses in the workplace, a union representative or a lawyer will contact them to help register a formal complaint and follow through with the process.\nThe service is being run by the Tamil Nadu Textile and Common Labour Union, one of the largest women workers’ unions in India’s textile hub.\nUnion president Thivyarakhini Sesuraj said volunteers are spreading the word in “every village” throughout the five Tamil Nadu districts where the service is so far being provided.\n“Problems that workers face are buried inside the spinning mill or garment factory they work in,” she said. “Now a phone call will give officials outside a glimpse of the challenges workers face.”\nReporting by Anuradha Nagaraj, Editing by Jared Ferrie; Please credit the Thomson Reuters Foundation, the charitable arm of Thomson Reuters, that covers humanitarian news, women's rights, trafficking and climate change.
