The lawsuit also names Bosch as a defendant. \n“Bosch takes the allegations of manipulation of the diesel software very seriously. It is a well-known fact that these allegations remain the subject of investigations and civil litigation involving Bosch,” the company said in a statement. \n“Bosch is cooperating with the continuing investigations in various jurisdictions, and is defending its interests in the litigation,” it added, declining to comment further.
