Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel told reporters on Wednesday at a city hall press conference: “We’re going to go compete and we’re going to put our best foot forward.”\nApple’s decision stands in contrast to Amazon, which has held a highly publicized process to select a second headquarters that the e-commerce giant says will generate as many as 50,000 jobs.\nOn Thursday, Amazon narrowed its list of applicants to 20 cities, including Canada’s Toronto and smaller cities such as Raleigh, North Carolina and Columbus, Ohio.\nReporting by Stephen Nellis in San Francisco, Additional reporting by Karen Pierog in Chicago, Editing by Rosalba O'Brien\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-18T23:52:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-19T00:12:55.006+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
