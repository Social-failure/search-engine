As of Dec. 31, clients held $1.9 billion in cash deposits in the portfolios.\n“Our inherent scalability positions us to efficiently bring on these accounts and materially expand our U.S. household penetration,” E*Trade Chief Executive Karl Roessner said in a statement.\nCapital One declined to comment and referred questions to E*Trade.\nThe acquisition, which will be funded with existing corporate cash, is expected to have a neutral impact on 2018 earnings, the statement said.\nThe discount brokerage also reported a 13 percent fall in fourth-quarter net income to $127 million, as the company recognized a $58 million tax expense due to the new U.S. tax law.
