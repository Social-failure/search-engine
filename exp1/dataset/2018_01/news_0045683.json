It is one of a shrinking range of North Korean cash sources not specifically targeted by international sanctions.\nJoint ventures with the state are banned, however, making attracting international investment in North Korea’s tourism industry difficult.\nLast year, America banned its citizens from visiting North Korea and there are no up-to-date statistics on current visitors.\nChina said more than 237,000 Chinese visited in 2012 but it stopped publishing the statistics in 2013. For comparison, eight million Chinese visited South Korea in 2016.\nReporting by Josh Smith; Editing by Nick Macfie\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-01-25T17:49:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-26T21:32:40.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
