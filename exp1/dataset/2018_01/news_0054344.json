Defense lawyers also said Chin had no reason the believe that the steroids were contaminated before they were shipped.\nThe verdict in Chin's case came after a separate jury in March found Cadden guilty of racketeering and fraud but similarly cleared him of second-degree murder over the deaths of 25 people.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-31T21:12:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-31T21:12:01.006+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
