REUTERS/Michaela Rehle \nNew offers can be made for Niki until Friday and a decision will follow within days, German administrator Lucas Floether and his Austrian counterpart Ulla Reisch said in a joint statement on Tuesday. \n“The signatures of both administrators will guarantee the buyer legal security for the closing of the sales contract,” Floether and Reisch said. \nNiki filed for insolvency in Berlin last month after Germany’s Lufthansa ( LHAG.DE ) scrapped plans to buy the Austrian arm of insolvent Air Berlin. \nAfter hurried talks to ensure Niki retained valuable runway slots, British Airways owner IAG ( ICAG.L ) agreed with the German administrator to buy the business for 20 million euros (17.78 million pounds) and make it part of low-cost unit Vueling.
