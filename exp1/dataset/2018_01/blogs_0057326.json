Amazon’s Alexa assistant lost her voice in the company’s preview of its Super Bowl ad. \nAdvertisers are likely to stick with proven strategies, such as comedy or positive emotions rather than controversies such as athletes kneeling during the National Anthem , marketing experts said. \n“My strong prediction is you will see a lot more safe ads,” said Derek Rucker, marketing professor at Northwestern University’s Kellogg School of Management, which runs an annual review of Super Bowl commercials. \nRead: These Super Bowl LII Commercials Are Already Streaming Online \nRatings for National Football League games dropped nearly 10% during the regular season. Media experts said protests over racial inequality drove some viewers away. TV broadcasters showed players kneeling or locking arms during pre-game presentations of “The Star-Spangled Banner,” prompting President Donald Trump to call them unpatriotic. \nSuper Bowl advertisers are likely to avoid the topic altogether, said Charles R. Taylor, marketing professor at the Villanova School of Business. His research has found that 49% of Super Bowl commercials during the past decade used humor, which he expects to continue. \n“The country is just so divided that, for a mass marketer, I think it’s really a mistake to make any type of political statement,” Taylor said. “In the long run, you don’t make up for the people you alienate.” \nRead: Local Craft Brewers Are Betting Big on Super Bowl 52 \nLast year, a handful of spots hit on topics such as immigration and diversity but took measured tones aimed at appealing to a broad range of viewers, Taylor said. \nFor this year’s game, veterans organization Amvets tried to place a one-page advertisement with the message “#PleaseStand” in the Super Bowl program. The NFL rejected the ad and said the program was not a place for anything that could be viewed as a political statement. \nThe game program will include a Veterans of Foreign Wars ad that supports veterans, and the league will celebrate the military at the game, NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell told ESPN Radio on Tuesday. \nRead: Minnesota Is Seeing Lots of Flu Cases Ahead of Super Bowl LII \nOn television, advertisers cannot afford any missteps. Broadcaster NBC, a unit of Comcast (cmcsa) , charged an average of $5 million-plus for a 30-second spot. More than 100 million viewers are expected to watch the contest. \nThis year, more brands are holding back their ads to preserve the element of surprise rather than posting them online in advance of game day. \nSome that have revealed their strategies are tying their products to social missions, an approach that appeals to millennials, Taylor said. \nIn one case, actor Matt Damon tells viewers that Anheuser Busch Inbev (bud) label Stella Artois is donating funds to bring clean water to Africa. Carmaker Hyundai (hymtf) plans a 60-second commercial that recognizes people fighting pediatric cancers and spotlights the company’s nonprofit organization dedicated to the cause. \nSome brands may opt for a dark or political theme to try to stand out from the roughly 50 ads that run during the game, Rucker said. \n“If there are a couple that break that trend, they will get more attention,” Rucker said. “The question will be will they navigate it properly, or will they be the source of ridicule?” SPONSORED FINANCIAL CONTENT ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-31T13:26:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-31T13:27:06.008+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
