Eleven people were injured and around 100 skiers took refuge in a mountain hut for several hours until rescued.\nZao, like Kusatsu-Shirane, is a popular resort area famed for its “snow monsters,” created by water vapor freezing on trees in winter. Its slopes are packed with skiers in winter and hikers in other seasons.\nJapan has 110 active volcanoes and monitors 47 of them around the clock. In September 2014, 63 people were killed on Mount Ontake, the worst volcanic disaster in Japan for nearly 90 years.\nReporting by Elaine Lies; Editing by Michael Perry\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-30T09:04:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-30T09:15:00.012+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
