An Air France Boeing 787-9 scale model is seen in Paris, France January 10, 2018. REUTERS/Gonzalo Fuentes \nItalian Industry Minister Carlo Calenda on Friday said separate offers had been presented by U.S. private equity fund Cerberus and Germany’s Lufthansa ( LHAG.DE ), as well as a joint Air France-EasyJet bid. \nBut in a statement, Air France said it had not taken part in the process launched by the Italian authorities. \n“Air France-KLM denies having made an offer to take over Alitalia,” Air France said in a statement. \nHeavily indebted Alitalia, which has only turned a profit a few times in its 70-year history, was put under special administration last year after its staff rejected a plan to cut jobs and salaries.
