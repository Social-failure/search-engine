We expect growth momentum to reach Asia, Asian stocks are up and so the baht is strengthening with regional peers.” \nThe Thai economy depends significantly on exports, which have been under pressure from the baht’s strength. \nIn 2017, during which exports increased, the baht strengthened more than 9 percent against the dollar. \nOn Friday, the baht touched its strongest in 39 months, at 32.14 against the dollar. \nThe central bank has forecast economic growth of 3.9 percent for 2017 and 2018. Growth in 2016 was 3.2 percent. The 2017 growth numbers will be released next month.
