The identity of the men is unknown. \nThe Interior Ministry could not be immediately reached for comment. \nSecurity sources said the alleged attackers were being questioned at a police station along with Genena. The sources said the injuries were the result of a fight between Genena and the group of men. \n“His knee is broken and he is bleeding from several parts of his body ... they were trying to kill him,” his wife, Wafaa Kedieh, told Reuters. \nOn Tuesday, an army statement read on state TV said Anan’s presidential bid amounted to “a serious breach of the laws of military service” because as a military officer he was required to end his service and get permission before seeking office. \nAs Egypt’s top auditor, Genena had stirred controversy by publicly concluding that government corruption has cost the country billions of dollars. He was sacked by Sisi in 2016.
