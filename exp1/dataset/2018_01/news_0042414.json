Net loss available to common stockholders for the quarter ended December 31, 2017 was $(35.3) million, or $(0.16) per diluted share, compared to net income available to common stockholders of $44.9 million, or $0.33 per diluted share, for the linked quarter ended September 30, 2017 and net income available to common stockholders of $41.0 million, or $0.31 per diluted share, for the three months ended December 31, 2016.\nNet income available to common stockholders for the year ended December 31, 2017 was $91.0 million, or $0.58 per diluted share, compared to net income available to common stockholders of $140.0 million, or $1.07 per diluted share, for the year ended December 31, 2016.\nResults for the fourth quarter and full year 2017 were impacted by merger-related expense and restructuring charges incurred in connection with the Astoria Merger, and a charge to income tax expense related to the Company’s net deferred tax assets due to the changes in tax law. Please refer to the section below “Reconciliation of GAAP Results to Adjusted Results (Non-GAAP)” for additional information on these charges.\nPresident’s Comments\nJack Kopnisky, President and Chief Executive Officer, commented: “We delivered another year of strong operating performance, closing 2017 as a larger, more diversified and more profitable company. As of December 31, 2017, our total assets increased to $30.4 billion, from $14.2 billion a year ago; our total gross loans increased to $20.0 billion from $9.5 billion a year ago; and our total deposits increased to $20.5 billion, from $10.1 billion a year ago.\n“Our strategy and execution have remained consistent since the current management team joined the Company in July 2011. Our primary focus has always been to deliver consistent improvements in operating leverage and efficiency, targeting growth in operating revenues at 2-3x the growth in operating expenses. To achieve this, we grow loans and deposits organically by generating higher levels of productivity from our existing commercial banking teams, we recruit and hire new commercial banking teams that fit our culture and strategy, we allocate capital to business lines and client segments that are scalable and that meet our risk-adjusted return hurdles, and we augment organic growth through opportunistic acquisitions that allow us to accelerate reaching new levels of efficiency and profitability. We are creating a company with a performance driven culture in which our colleagues are highly motivated and rewarded for delivering superior service and results.\n“Our strategy is working; since December 2011, our total assets, adjusted earnings available to common stockholders and adjusted diluted earnings per share available to common stockholders have grown at a compound annual growth rate of 46.3%, 68.5% and 32.5%, respectively. Our growth has resulted in significant improvements in profitability and returns. For the year ended December 31, 2017, our adjusted diluted earnings per share available to common stockholders were $1.40, our adjusted return on average tangible assets was 1.27% and our adjusted return on average tangible common equity was 15.17%. We have also delivered substantial efficiency improvements. Since 2011, our total operating revenues have grown at almost 2x our total operating expenses. For the year ended December 31, 2017, our adjusted operating efficiency ratio was 41.8%.\n“The fundamentals of our business are strong heading into 2018. Adjusting for the balances acquired in the Astoria Merger, we grew total commercial loans by $543.7 million in the fourth quarter, representing an annualized growth rate of 15.4% over the prior quarter. Astoria’s attractive deposit franchise and the significant investments we have made in hiring commercial banking teams across all of our business lines will allow us to continue growing and building a diversified balance sheet with strong core funding. With over 8% in tangible common equity to tangible assets and an estimated Tier 1 Leverage ratio of 9.40%, we have ample capital to support our strategy.\n“The Astoria Merger has allowed us to identify significant revenue enhancement and cost savings opportunities. Through the continued execution of our strategy, we anticipate we will transition the combined balance sheet, increase profitability and efficiency, and achieve our goal of building a high performing, diversified regional bank that serves middle market commercial clients and consumers. We are well positioned to capitalize on these opportunities.\n“We would like to thank our clients, colleagues and shareholders for your support and look forward to continuing to work with all of our partners as we continue to build a great company.\n“Lastly, we have declared a dividend on our common stock of $0.07 per share payable on February 20, 2018 to holders of record as of February 5, 2018.”\nReconciliation of GAAP Results to Adjusted Results (non-GAAP)\nThe Company’s GAAP net loss available to common stockholders of $(35.3) million, or $(0.16) per diluted share, for the fourth quarter of 2017, included the following items:\n2\na pre-tax charge of $30.2 million due to merger-related expense associated with the Astoria Merger for professional fees, change-in-control payments, insurance, client communications, and due diligence expenses; a pre-tax charge of $104.5 million associated with the Astoria Merger for asset write-downs, systems integration expenses, and severance and retention compensation; a pre-tax net loss on sale of securities of $70 thousand; and the pre-tax amortization of non-compete agreements and acquired customer list intangible assets of $333 thousand.\nIn addition, in the fourth quarter of 2017, in connection with the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, we recorded a charge of $40.3 million in income tax expense to write-down our net deferred tax assets to their estimated value. Excluding the impact of these items and their corresponding tax adjustment at the Company’s estimated effective tax rate of 31.5% for full year 2017, adjusted net income available to common stockholders was $87.2 million, or $0.39 per diluted share.\nNon-GAAP financial measures include references to the terms “adjusted” or “excluding”.

The tax equivalent adjustment is assumed at 35% federal tax rate for all periods presented. Fourth quarter 2017 compared with fourth quarter 2016\nNet interest income was $234.0 million, an increase of $126.8 million compared to the fourth quarter of 2016. This was mainly due to an increase in average loans outstanding between the periods as a result of the Astoria Merger and loans originated through our commercial banking teams. Other key components of the changes in net interest income and net interest margin were the following:\nThe yield on loans was 4.77%, compared to 4.49% for the three months ended December 31, 2016. The increase in yield on loans was mainly due to an increase in accretion income on acquired loans, which was $33.7 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 compared to $4.5 million in the fourth quarter of 2016. Accretion income on acquired loans in the fourth quarter of 2017 included $29.9 million related to the Astoria Merger. Average commercial loans were $14.0 billion compared to $8.2 billion in the fourth quarter of 2016, an increase of $5.8 billion or 70.0%. The tax equivalent yield on investment securities increased 22 basis points to 3.03%. This was mainly due to an increase in the proportion of tax exempt securities in the investment portfolio and an increase in market interest rates. Average tax exempt securities balances grew to $2.1 billion for the quarter ended December 31, 2017, compared to $1.2 billion in the fourth quarter of 2016. Average investment securities were $5.9 billion, or 22.8%, of average earning assets for the fourth quarter of 2017 compared to $3.0 billion, or 23.7%, of average earning assets for the fourth quarter of 2016.\n3\nThe tax equivalent yield on interest earning assets increased 30 basis points between the periods to 4.32%. The cost of total deposits was 43 basis points and the cost of borrowings was 1.94%, compared to 36 basis points and 1.72%, respectively, for the same period a year ago. The total cost of interest bearing liabilities increased eight basis points to 0.82% for the fourth quarter of 2017 compared to 0.74% for fourth quarter of 2016. This increase was due to an increase in market interest rates, which increased the cost of wholesale, brokered and certificates of deposit between the periods.\nThe tax equivalent net interest margin was 3.67% for the fourth quarter of 2017 compared to 3.52% for the fourth quarter of 2016. The increase in tax equivalent net interest margin was mainly due to an increase in accretion income on acquired loans. Excluding accretion income, tax equivalent net interest margin was 3.16% for the fourth quarter of 2017 compared to 3.37% in the fourth quarter of 2016.\nFourth quarter 2017 compared with linked quarter ended September 30, 2017\nNet interest income increased $114.0 million compared to the linked quarter ended September 30, 2017. The increase in net interest income in the fourth quarter of 2017 relative to the linked quarter was mainly due to the Astoria Merger and the resulting increase in the average balance of loans and investment securities outstanding. Key components of the changes in net interest income in the linked quarter were the following:\nThe yield on loans was 4.77% compared to 4.67% for the linked quarter, an increase of 10 basis points, which was mainly due to accretion income on acquired loans. Accretion income on acquired loans was $33.7 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 compared to $3.4 million in the linked quarter. The average balance of loans increased $9.3 billion for the fourth quarter of 2017 compared to the linked quarter. Based on end of period balances, total loans increased $9.5 billion relative to the linked quarter. The tax equivalent yield on investment securities increased 16 basis points to 3.03% in the fourth quarter of 2017. Average investment securities increased $2.0 billion compared to the linked quarter. The tax equivalent yield on interest earning assets increased 20 basis points in the fourth quarter of 2017 to 4.32% compared to 4.12% in the linked quarter. The cost of total deposits decreased seven basis points to 43 basis points in the quarter. This was mainly due to the deposits assumed in the Astoria Merger. The total cost of borrowings increased to 1.94% compared to 1.75% in the linked quarter due to $200.0 million of principal balance of senior notes assumed in the Astoria Merger and an increase in other borrowings. Average interest bearing deposits increased by $8.8 billion and average borrowings increased $1.3 billion relative to the linked quarter, which resulted in an increase of $16.9 million in interest expense.\nThe tax equivalent net interest margin was 3.67% compared to 3.42% in the linked quarter. Excluding accretion income on acquired loans of $3.4 million, net interest margin was 3.32% in the linked quarter.\nThe decline in tax equivalent net interest margin excluding accretion income between the current quarter and the prior periods presented was due to a change in the composition of our loan portfolio as a result of the Astoria Merger. In the fourth quarter of 2017, residential mortgage loans represented 26.5% of average loans and multi-family loans represented 24.4%. A year earlier, residential mortgage loans comprised 8.2% of average earning assets and multi-family loans comprised 10.3% of average loans. Residential mortgage and multi-family loans typically have lower yields than our commercial loans. We anticipate replacing the run-off of residential mortgage and multi-family loans with higher yielding commercial loans, which we expect will offset a significant portion of future declines in accretion income on acquired loans.\nThrough the fourth quarter of 2017, we calculated the tax equivalent adjustment on securities assuming a federal tax rate of 35%. Due to the tax law changes, we will begin reporting the tax equivalent adjustment assuming a federal tax rate of 21% in the first quarter of 2018. Although this change will have no impact on our GAAP net interest margin or the cash flows received from our securities portfolio, we anticipate this change will result in a decrease of 15 to 20 basis points in tax equivalent yield on securities and a decrease of eight to 10 basis points in tax equivalent net interest margin. We anticipate the decrease in tax equivalent net interest margin will be offset by a reduction in our estimated effective income tax rate, which will likely result in an increase to net income.\n4\nNon-interest Income\n($ in thousands) For the three months ended Change % 12/31/2016 9/30/2017 12/31/2017 Y-o-Y Linked Qtr Total non-interest income $ 16,057 $ 13,988 $ 23,762 48.0 % 69.9 % Net (loss) on sale of securities (102 ) (21 ) (70 ) (31.4 ) 233.3 Net gain on sale of trust division 2,255 — — (100.0 ) NM Adjusted non-interest income $ 13,904 $ 14,009 $ 23,832 71.4 70.1 Fourth quarter 2017 compared with fourth quarter 2016\nExcluding net (loss) on sale of securities and net gain on sale of trust division, adjusted non-interest income increased $9.9 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 to $23.8 million compared to $13.9 million in the same quarter last year. The change was mainly due to the Astoria Merger. Deposit fees and service charges increased by $4.1 million, bank owned life insurance income increased by $2.1 million and investment management fees increased by $1.5 million, which were all related to the completion of the Astoria Merger. In addition, fee income on loan swaps in the fourth quarter of 2017 increased to $1.1 million compared to $539 thousand for the year ago period.\nFourth quarter 2017 compared with linked quarter ended September 30, 2017\nExcluding net (loss) on sale of securities, adjusted non-interest income increased approximately $9.8 million from $14.0 million in the linked quarter to $23.8 million in the fourth quarter of 2017. This was mainly due to the same factors as discussed above.\nNon-interest Expense\n($ in thousands) For the three months ended Change % / bps 12/31/2016 9/30/2017 12/31/2017 Y-o-Y Linked Qtr Compensation and benefits $ 32,060 $ 32,433 $ 55,670 73.6 % 71.6 % Stock-based compensation plans 1,557 1,969 2,508 61.1 27.4 Occupancy and office operations 8,372 8,583 18,100 116.2 110.9 Amortization of intangible assets 2,881 2,166 6,426 123.0 196.7 FDIC insurance and regulatory assessments 1,531 2,310 5,737 274.7 148.4 Other real estate owned, net (“OREO”) 206 894 742 260.2 (17.0 ) Merger-related expenses — 4,109 30,230 — 635.7 Charge for asset write-downs, systems integration, retention and severance — — 104,506 NM NM Other expenses 10,465 10,153 26,827 156.3 164.2 Total non-interest expense $ 57,072 $ 62,617 $ 250,746 339.4 300.4 Full time equivalent employees (“FTEs”) at period end 970 992 2,076 114.0 109.3 Financial centers at period end 42 40 128 204.8 220.0 Efficiency ratio, as reported 46.3 % 46.7 % 97.3 % (5,100 ) (5,060 ) Efficiency ratio, as adjusted 6 43.3 40.6 41.4 190 (80 ) 6 See a reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures beginning on page 17. Fourth quarter 2017 compared with fourth quarter 2016\nTotal non-interest expense increased $193.7 million relative to the fourth quarter of 2016. Key components of the change in non-interest expense were the following:\nCompensation and benefits increased $23.6 million between the periods. Total FTEs increased to 2,076, which was mainly due to the Astoria Merger. In addition, we continued to hire commercial bankers and risk management personnel. Occupancy and office operations increased $9.7 million mainly due to 88 financial centers and other locations acquired in the Astoria Merger. Amortization of intangible assets increased $3.5 million between the periods. This was due to the Astoria Merger; the increase represents the amortization of the core deposit intangible asset that was recorded.\n5\nFDIC insurance and regulatory assessments increased $4.2 million to $5.7 million in the fourth quarter of 2017, compared to $1.5 million for the fourth quarter of 2016. This was mainly due to growth in our total assets. OREO expense increased $536 thousand to $742 thousand in the fourth quarter of 2017, compared to $206 thousand for the fourth quarter of 2016. This was mainly due to write-downs on the value of properties based on updated appraisals. Merger-related expense was $30.2 million in the fourth quarter of 2017, and included advisory fees, accounting and consulting fees, change-in-control payments, insurance premium expense and client communications expense. We did not incur merger-related expense in the fourth quarter of 2016. Charge for asset write-downs, systems integration, retention and severance was $104.5 million, and included charges for severance and retention compensation, systems integration expense, and asset write-downs to continue our financial center and real estate consolidation strategy. We did not incur similar charges in the fourth quarter of 2016. Other expenses increased $16.4 million mainly due to the Astoria Merger and included a $9.5 million increase in data processing expense, a $1.0 million increase in communications expense, $999 thousand increase in advertising expense, and a $851 thousand increase in operational losses.\nFourth quarter 2017 compared with linked quarter ended September 30, 2017\nTotal non-interest expense increased $188.1 million from $62.6 million in the linked quarter to $250.7 million in the fourth quarter of 2017. Key components of the change in non-interest expense were the following:\nCompensation and benefits increased $23.2 million and was $55.7 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 compared to $32.4 million in the linked quarter. This was mainly due to the Astoria Merger. Occupancy and office operations increased $9.5 million mainly due to 88 financial centers and other locations acquired in the Astoria Merger. Merger-related expense was $30.2 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 compared to $4.1 million in the linked quarter. Charges for asset write-downs, systems integration, severance and retention was $104.5 million in the fourth quarter of 2017. OREO expense declined $152 thousand in the fourth quarter of 2017 due to lower property taxes incurred in the fourth quarter of 2017 compared to the linked quarter. Other expense increased $16.7 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 and was $26.8 million compared to $10.2 million in the linked quarter. The increase was mainly due to the Astoria Merger.\nThrough December 31, 2017, we have recorded merger-related expense and other charges related to the Astoria Merger of $143.7 million, which is below the estimate of $165.0 million that we presented at the announcement of the Astoria Merger. The difference between the actual amounts recorded and the initial estimate is mainly due to lower asset write-downs and restructuring charges on real estate and facilities. As we continue to execute the integration of Astoria, we may incur incremental charges related mainly to additional financial center and real estate consolidations. We estimate that in aggregate, these charges will be below our initial $165.0 million estimate and will be recognized once the GAAP requirements for recording these expenses are met.\nTaxes\nFor the three months ended December 31, 2017, the Company incurred a pre-tax loss of $(5.0) million. However, we recorded income tax expense of $28.3 million which included a charge of $40.3 million to write-down our net deferred tax assets to their estimated value due to the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017.\nDue to the completion of the Astoria Merger and the merger-related expense and other charges discussed above, we revised our 2017 GAAP estimated effective income tax rate to 26.5% from 32.5%. As a result, we reduced year to date income tax expense by recording an income tax benefit in the fourth quarter of 2017. The components of income tax expense in the fourth quarter were a benefit of $1.3 million based on our pre-tax loss of $(5.0) million and our 26.5% GAAP estimated effective tax rate; a benefit of $810 thousand related to vesting of stock-based compensation; the charge of $40.3 million related to the tax law change; and a benefit of $9.8 million related to the first nine months of 2017 to reduce income tax expense to 26.5% of pre-tax income for full year 2017.\nThe Company’s adjusted earnings (non-GAAP) measures are calculated using an estimated effective tax rate of 31.5% for the full year and fourth quarter of 2017. This estimate excludes the impact that merger-related expense and other charges had on the Company’s GAAP effective tax rate. Through the first three quarters of 2017, the Company estimated an effective tax rate of 32.5% for GAAP and adjusted earnings. The decrease to 31.5% in the fourth quarter is due to an increase in the proportion of non-taxable income given strong origination volumes in public sector finance, purchases of municipal securities, an increase in bank owned life insurance income and an income tax benefit associated with the vesting of stock-based compensation in the fourth quarter of 2017.\n6\nGiven the changes in tax laws, the Company anticipates it will record income taxes at an estimated effective tax rate of approximately 24% in 2018.\nKey Balance Sheet Highlights as of December 31, 2017\n($ in thousands) As of Change % / bps 12/31/2016 9/30/2017 12/31/2017 Y-o-Y Linked Qtr Total assets $ 14,178,447 $ 16,780,097 $ 30,359,541 114.1 % 80.9 % Total portfolio loans, gross 9,527,230 10,493,535 20,008,983 110.0 90.7 Commercial & industrial (“C&I”) loans 4,171,950 4,841,664 5,306,821 27.2 9.6 Commercial real estate loans 4,144,018 4,473,245 8,998,419 117.1 101.2 Acquisition, development and construction loans 230,086 236,456 282,792 22.9 19.6 Total commercial loans 8,546,054 9,551,365 14,588,032 70.7 52.7 Total deposits 10,068,259 11,043,438 20,538,204 104.0 86.0 Core deposits 6 8,805,301 9,753,052 17,100,838 94.2 75.3 Investment securities 3,118,838 4,515,650 6,474,561 107.6 43.4 Total borrowings 2,056,612 3,453,783 4,991,210 142.7 44.5 Loans to deposits 94.6 % 95.0 % 97.4 % 280 240 Core deposits to total deposits 87.5 88.3 83.3 (420 ) (500 ) Investment securities to total assets 22.0 26.9 21.3 (70 ) (560 ) 6 Core deposits include retail, commercial and municipal transaction, money market and savings accounts and exclude certificates of deposit and brokered deposits, except for reciprocal Certificate of Deposit Account Registry balances. Highlights in balance sheet items as of December 31, 2017 were the following:\nC&I loans (which include traditional C&I, asset-based lending, payroll finance, warehouse lending, factored receivables, equipment financing and public sector finance loans) represented 26.5%, commercial real estate loans represented 45.0%, consumer and residential mortgage loans combined represented 27.1%, and acquisition, development and construction loans represented 1.4% of the total loan portfolio. Loan growth was a result of the Astoria Merger and originations generated by commercial banking teams. C&I loans grew $465.2 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 compared to the linked quarter. We acquired $96.9 million of C&I loans in the Astoria Merger. Excluding loans acquired in the Astoria Merger, C&I loans increased $368.3 million, or 29.6% annualized in the fourth quarter of 2017. Commercial loans, which includes all C&I loans, commercial real estate (including multi-family) and acquisition, development and construction loans, increased by $6.0 billion for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017. Commercial loans increased by $5.0 billion relative to the linked quarter. Loans acquired in the Astoria Merger represented $4.5 billion of this increase. Multi-family loans, which are included in commercial real estate in the table above increased $3.8 billion in the fourth quarter of 2017 and reached $4.9 billion. The increase was due to the Astoria Merger. Residential mortgage loans were $5.1 billion at December 31, 2017 compared to $672 million at September 30, 2017, the increase was due to the Astoria Merger. Aggregate exposure to taxi medallion relationships was $46.0 million, which represented 0.23% of total loans as of December 31, 2017, a decline of $5.7 million from $51.7 million as of December 31, 2016. The decline was mainly due to a charge-off of $2.0 million and repayments. Total deposits at December 31, 2017 increased $9.5 billion compared to September 30, 2017, and increased $10.5 billion over December 31, 2016. We assumed $9.0 billion of deposits in the Astoria Merger. The remaining increase in deposits was mainly due to growth in commercial deposits and certificates of deposit. Core deposits at December 31, 2017 increased $7.3 billion compared to September 30, 2017. The increase was mainly due to the Astoria Merger. Core deposits increased $8.3 billion over December 31, 2016.\n7\nMunicipal deposits at December 31, 2017 were $1.6 billion and decreased by $165.9 million relative to the linked quarter. Municipal deposits experience seasonal highs at the end of the third quarter. Investment securities increased by $2.0 billion relative to the linked quarter, and represented 21.3% of total assets at December 31, 2017.\nCredit Quality\n($ in thousands) For the three months ended Change % / bps 12/31/2016 9/30/2017 12/31/2017 Y-o-Y Linked Qtr Provision for loan losses $ 5,500 $ 5,000 $ 12,000 118.2 % 140.0 % Net charge-offs 1,283 3,023 6,221 384.9 105.8 Allowance for loan losses 63,622 72,128 77,907 22.5 8.0 Non-performing loans 78,853 69,452 187,213 137.4 169.6 Net charge-offs annualized 0.06 % 0.12 % 0.13 % 7 1 Allowance for loan losses to total loans 0.67 0.69 0.39 (28 ) (30 ) Allowance for loan losses to non-performing loans 80.7 103.9 41.6 (3,910 ) (6,230 ) Provision for loan losses was $12.0 million for the fourth quarter of 2017 compared to $5.0 million in the linked quarter and $5.5 million in the same period a year ago. In the fourth quarter of 2017, provision for loan losses was $5.8 million in excess of net charge-offs of $6.2 million. Allowance coverage ratios were 0.39% of total loans and 41.6% of non-performing loans at December 31, 2017. Due to the Astoria Merger, a significant portion of the Company’s loan portfolio does not carry an allowance for loan losses, as the acquired loans are recorded at their estimated fair value on the acquisition date. Non-performing loans increased by $117.8 million to $187.2 million at December 31, 2017 compared to the linked quarter. The increase in non-performing loans at December 31, 2017 is mainly due to $99.9 million of non-performing loans acquired in the Astoria Merger.\nCapital\n($ in thousands, except share and per share data) As of Change % / bps 12/31/2016 9/30/2017 12/31/2017 Y-o-Y Three\nmonths Total stockholders’ equity $ 1,855,183 $ 1,971,480 $ 4,240,178 128.6 % 115.1 % Preferred stock — — 139,220 NM NM Goodwill and intangible assets 762,953 756,290 1,733,082 127.2 129.2 Tangible common stockholders’ equity $ 1,092,230 $ 1,215,190 $ 2,367,876 116.8 94.9 Common shares outstanding 135,257,570 135,807,544 224,782,694 66.2 65.5 Book value per common share $ 13.72 $ 14.52 $ 18.24 32.9 25.6 Tangible book value per common share 7 8.08 8.95 10.53 30.3 17.7 Tangible common equity to tangible assets 7 8.14 % 7.58 % 8.27 % 13 69 Estimated Tier 1 leverage ratio - Company 8.95 8.42 9.40 45 98 Estimated Tier 1 leverage ratio - Bank 9.08 8.49 10.08 100 159 7 See a reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures beginning on page 17. In connection with the Astoria Merger, the Company issued $135 million of 6.50% Non-Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock with a liquidation preference of $1,000 per share (the “Preferred Stock”) in exchange for each share of Astoria’s 6.50% Non-Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the the Astoria Merger. The Preferred Stock is redeemable in whole or in part from time to time, on October 15, 2022 or any dividend payment date thereafter.\nThe increase in total stockholders’ equity of $2.3 billion to $4.2 billion as of December 31, 2017 compared to September 30, 2017 was mainly due to the Astoria Merger. We issued 88.8 million shares of our common stock with a value of $2.2 billion as consideration for Astoria. Stock-based compensation activity increased stockholders’ equity by $3.3 million. These increases were partially offset by a net loss of $33.3 million, common dividends of $15.7 million and preferred dividends of $2.2 million.\n8\nTotal goodwill and other intangible assets were $1.7 billion at December 31, 2017, an increase of $976.8 million compared to September 30, 2017, which was due to goodwill and the core deposit intangible asset recorded in the Astoria Merger, net of amortization of intangibles for the period.\nFor the quarter ended December 31, 2017, basic and diluted weighted average common shares outstanding increased to 223.5 million and 224.1 million, respectively, compared to 135.3 million and 136.0 million, respectively, for the quarter ended September 30, 2017. The increase in the diluted weighted average shares was mainly due to the shares issued in the Astoria Merger. Total common shares outstanding at December 31, 2017 were approximately 224.8 million.\nTangible book value per share was $10.53 at December 31, 2017, which represented an increase of 30.3% over a year ago and an increase of 17.7% over September 30, 2017.\nConference Call Information\nSterling Bancorp will host a teleconference and webcast on Wednesday, January 24, 2018 at 10:30 AM Eastern Time to discuss the Company’s results.

These non-GAAP/adjusted financial measures complement our GAAP reporting and are presented above to provide investors, analysts, regulators and others information that we use to manage and evaluate our performance each period. This information supplements our GAAP reported results, and should not be viewed in isolation from, or as a substitute for, our GAAP results. When non-GAAP/adjusted measures are impacted by income tax expense, we present the pre-tax amount for the income and expense items that result in the non-GAAP adjustments and present the income tax expense impact at the effective tax rate in effect for the period presented.\n20\n1 Stockholders’ equity as a percentage of total assets, book value per common share, tangible common equity as a percentage of tangible assets and tangible book common value per share provides information to help assess our capital position and financial strength. We believe tangible book measures improve comparability to other banking organizations that have not engaged in acquisitions that have resulted in the accumulation of goodwill and other intangible assets.\n2 Reported return on average tangible common equity and adjusted return on average tangible common equity measures provide information to evaluate the use of our tangible common equity.\n3 Reported return on tangible assets and adjusted return on tangible assets measures provide information to help assess our profitability.\n4 The reported operating efficiency ratio is a non-GAAP measure calculated by dividing our GAAP non-interest expense by the sum of our GAAP net interest income plus GAAP non-interest income. The adjusted operating efficiency ratio is a non-GAAP measure calculated by dividing non-interest expense adjusted for intangible asset amortization and certain expenses generally associated with discrete merger transactions and non-recurring strategic plans by the sum of net interest income plus non-interest income plus the tax equivalent adjustment on securities income and elimination of the impact of gain or loss on sale of securities. The adjusted operating efficiency ratio is a measure we use to assess our operating performance.\n5 Adjusted net income and adjusted diluted earnings per share present a summary of our earnings which includes adjustments to exclude certain revenues and expenses (generally associated with discrete merger transactions and non-recurring strategic plans) to help in assessing our profitability.\nSTERLING BANCORP CONTACT:\nLuis Massiani, SEVP & Chief Financial Officer\n845.369.8040\nhttp://www.sterlingbancorp.com\n21\nSource:Sterling Bancorp", "external_links": ["https://www.globenewswire.com/NewsRoom/AttachmentNg/d666a965-7d86-4ae4-9c4d-2063ba094cf6", "https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=3agCmfhfQypJr4a2aq2nH5VXNd_jAfS9sspgospm3HPKRz9bIhSO-uz0n1I7xTYPJ0M-IVIKaC1i7CsRULr42YfGsRlpDzp7pUCumBNoXEtQGUVAL_fj2WE7IJICByhV"], "published": "2018-01-24T00:10:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-24T00:40:18.027+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
