Artistic and scientific activity will be exempt. \nPoles have fought for years against the use of phrases like “Polish death camps”, which suggest Poland was at least partly responsible for the camps where millions people, mostly Jews, were killed by Nazi Germany. The camps were built and operated by the Nazis after they invaded Poland in 1939. \n“This amendment equips Poland with the most important tools that have long been at the disposal of other countries” Deputy Justice Minister Patryk Jaki told state news agency PAP. \nPoland’s ruling Law and Justice (PiS) party has invoked Poles’ suffering under Nazi occupation - including a death penalty for those who helped Jews - to respond to historical accounts that some Poles also committed crimes against the Jews during the war. \nPiS is currently battling accusations from the opposition that the party’s nationalist-minded, eurosceptic focus was helping to reinvigorate the far right. \nThe head of the Ukrainian national remembrance institute said on social media on Thursday that passing of the bill was likely to halt cooperation between Ukrainian and Polish historians, the PAP agency reported. \nIn November, Ukraine summoned the Polish ambassador in an escalation of a diplomatic spat over the two neighbours’ troubled past.
