The lack of involvement in these talks from nonwhite members of Congress delays the deal, she said, since any DACA agreement will require approval from the Congressional Hispanic Caucus and other groups. \n“The sensitivity even on the wording is really important [and] for people who are engaged in these issues to be there at the table. They’ve been working on it in a bipartisan way for a long time,” she said. \nThe DACA deal is more threatened by Trump’s comments than Pelosi’s. Trump rejected a bipartisan deal by saying that he didn’t want immigrants from “ shithole countries ” like Haiti and countries in Africa. \nYet, Pelosi’s peers are offended by her “five white guys” comment too. \n“That comment is offensive. I am committed to ensuring DREAMers are protected and I will welcome everyone to the table who wants to get this done,” Hoyer told Politico . \n", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-12T12:33:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-12T23:01:59.004+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
