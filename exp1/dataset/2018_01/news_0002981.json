It said only the woman who gives birth can be considered the child’s legal mother.\nIn September, the court made a similar ruling in a case concerning a transsexual man who gave birth to a baby and wanted to be registered as the legal father.\nThe court said in its ruling on Thursday that although the rights and duties of a transsexual person depended on their new gender, the legal relationship with his or her children remained unchanged.\nIn November, Germany’s constitutional court ruled in favor of the introduction of a third gender category for people who do not identify as either male or female or are born with an ambiguous sexual anatomy.\nReporting By Riham Alkousaa; Editing by Robin Pomeroy\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-04T16:27:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-04T16:44:33.015+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
