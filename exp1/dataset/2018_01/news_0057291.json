The employee who transmitted the alert said in a written statement to Hawaii that he or she believed it was an actual alert.\nReporting by David Shepardson Editing by Chizu Nomiyama\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-01-30T23:48:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-31T04:40:33.015+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
