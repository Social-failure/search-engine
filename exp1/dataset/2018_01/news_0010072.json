On two occasions, it said, he enlisted help from brokers to manipulate Libor. \nBetween 2008 and 2009, the watchdog said he entered into 28 “wash trades”, two identical trades that cancel each other out. \nThe trades had no legitimate purpose other than to pay two broker firms as thanks for personal hospitality Danziger had received, the FCA said in its statement. \nDanziger has denied that the trades and hospitality were connected. \nIn a notice of its decision on Danziger, the FCA detailed a phone call that one broker made to a colleague of Danziger’s at RBS on June 26, 2009. \nThe broker said he had been out with Danziger the previous evening, and asked whether Danziger was in the office. He “owes me a little switchy today”, the broker is alleged to have said. \nThe FCA said that in a separate phone call with another individual on the same day, the broker said he had run up a 2,000 pound drinks bill that evening and that Danziger had told him to “put a switch through”. \nThe FCA said ‘switch’ was a term used for wash trade, and that Danziger executed one later that day. \nThe regulator first proposed action against Danziger in 2014, but this was put on hold due to a then ongoing investigation by the Serious Fraud Office.
