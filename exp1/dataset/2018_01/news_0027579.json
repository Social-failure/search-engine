Mediobanca Securities analysts estimated revenues from the unit at just 2 percent of Banco BPM’s 2019-2020 adjusted profit.\nBNP Paribas Securities Services, fully owned by BNP Paribas, is the world’s fifth-largest custodian bank.\nBack in 2010 BNP Paribas Securities Services bought the depositary bank of Banca Popolare di Milano, the Milanese lender which last year merged with Banco Popolare to create Banco BPM.\nReporting by Andrea Mandala, writing by Valentina Za, editing by Agnieszka Flak\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-01-19T00:48:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-19T12:24:14.001+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
