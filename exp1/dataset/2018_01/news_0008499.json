PiS faces local elections in late 2018 and legislative and presidential ballots in 2019 and 2020.\nIt remains to be seen whether Morawiecki will improve Warsaw’s relations with Brussels. He heads to Brussels later on Tuesday for talks.\nJudicial reforms at the heart of the dispute with Brussels are seen by PiS as a fundamental element of its efforts to overhaul Poland’s democratic institutions.\nPiS believes reforms are needed because the country has lost sight of its Catholic soul and is steeped mentality and power structures dating to the post-war communist era. Critics say that the government’s efforts to wield control over courts and public media are tilting Poland toward authoritarian rule.\nReporting by Pawel Sobczak and Lidia Kelly; editing by Mark Heinrich\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-01-09T19:39:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-09T14:53:45.035+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
