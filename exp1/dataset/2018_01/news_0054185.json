They had risen about 2 percent in premarket trading after the company’s quarterly results and full-year forecasts beat expectations.\nU.S. Treasury yields surged to more than three-year highs on expectations that central banks globally will reduce stimulus as the economic outlook improves. A rise in yields makes borrowing cash more expensive.\nMore than the rise in yields, the pace of the increase is what could hurt equity markets, said Hussein Sayed, chief market strategist at FXTM.\n“A simple question that may come to investors mind, is ‘why would I remain in equities when two-year U.S. treasury bills can provide the same divided yield return of the S&P 500?'.”\nAt 9:41 a.m. ET (1441 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 230.55 points, or 0.87 percent, at 26,208.93, the S&P 500 was down 20.52 points, or 0.71 percent, at 2,833.01.\nThe Nasdaq Composite was down 59.61 points, or 0.8 percent, at 7,406.89.\nThe CBOE Volatility Index, the most widely followed barometer of expected near-term stock volatility, hit a high of 14.69, its highest level since Aug. 21.\nAmong earnings, shares of Harley-Davidson dropped 6.7 percent after the motorcycle maker forecast a drop in shipments this year.\nMcDonald’s was down 1.2 percent after the company’s U.S. same-store sales failed to beat lofty Wall Street expectations.\nMetLife dropped 8 percent after saying the U.S. financial regulator is looking into the insurer’s failure to pay some workers’ pensions.\nApple was down another 1 percent, still feeling the effects of news that the company will halve production of its $999 iPhone X smartphone.\nDeclining issues outnumbered advancers on the NYSE by 2,218 to 522. On the Nasdaq, 1,936 issues fell and 608 advanced.\nThe S&P 500 index showed 8 new 52-week highs and no new lows, while the Nasdaq recorded 11 new highs and 15 new lows.
