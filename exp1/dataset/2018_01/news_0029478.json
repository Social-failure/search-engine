And it must not lose speed.” \nSources told Reuters this week that Continental had hired JP Morgan to work on strategic options for the company, including a separation of its current businesses. \nDegenhart said, however, seeking a higher valuation for a unit did not mean selling it outright, according to the magazine article.
