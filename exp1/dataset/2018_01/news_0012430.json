He will return to the dugout for the first time since the incident for Saturday’s home game against Girona in the league. \nMarcelino’s car was destroyed in the crash, while the boar, which typically weigh over 90 kilograms, was killed instantly. \n“It’s difficult for me to describe what happened but it’s as simple as we were on a toll road for security reasons and then suddenly I saw something ahead, it crashed into us and after that everything is difficult to remember,” he said. \n“Fortunately we are all here, three people have been born again. It was a distressing moment but we had a lucky outcome and the car came to a halt. That saved our lives and prevented us from having more serious injuries.” \nValencia made a flying start to the season under Marcelino and emerged as title contenders but have dropped to third in the standings, 11 points behind runaway leaders Barcelona.
