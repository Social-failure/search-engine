The Baoneng-related investor paid 6.63 billion yuan ($1 billion) for the stake. As a result, Kenon’s stake has fallen to 24 percent while Wuhu Chery Automobile Investment Co, a subsidiary of Chery Automobile Co, holds 25 percent. \nKenon has an option to sell its remaining stake in Qoros for 3.12 billion yuan and the investor has an option to increase its stake to 67 percent. \nQoros will be required to repay outstanding shareholder loans to Kenon and Chery in the amount of 944 million yuan. \nIn addition, the investor has committed that it, or its affiliate, will purchase approximately 100,000 vehicles from Qoros each year in the next three years.
