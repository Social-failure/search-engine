Thank you, thank you, thank you,” she squeaked from the red and white polka dot stage.

REUTERS/Mario Anzuoni \nPop star Katy Perry, also dressed in red and white polka dots for the occasion, said she had been a fan of Minnie since the age of two or three. \n“Minnie and Mickey printed diapers - that was my first memory ever and it turned into a lifelong devotion,” the “Firework” singer said. \n“No one rocks a bow, or the color red, quite like her,” Perry added.
