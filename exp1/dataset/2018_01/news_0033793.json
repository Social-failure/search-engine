Almarai has lost access to the Qatari market since June after Saudi Arabia severed trade and travel links with its neighbour in the Gulf’s most severe diplomatic split in years.\nThe company said revenue declined 2.6 percent, mainly due to loss of sales in the Gulf states and export countries, though sales were partly compensated by poultry, dairy and cheese products.\n$1 = 3.7498 riyals Reporting by Saeed Azhar; Editing by Tom Arnold\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-01-21T13:39:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-22T20:43:49.017+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
