Slideshow (5 Images) \nAside from the real roses blossoming on the trellises, guests were treated to embroidered flowers and a voluminous 50s-inspired skirt with watercolour-style splashes of colour. \nModels - including 16-year-old Kaia Gerber, daughter of supermodel Cindy Crawford - showed off intricate wedge boots assorted to their outfits, some with lace, some with sequins and jewels. \nDisplays from Paris’ select Haute couture club - a small circle of designers creating luxury, handmade outfits for clients - runs until Jan. 25.
