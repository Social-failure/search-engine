It was the blue-chip index's biggest one-day reversal since Feb. 10, 2016.\n\"It's a warning shot across the bow,\" Aviance's president and chief investment officer said in an interview with \" Closing Bell .\"\n\"It's time to look a little more defensively … and start moving away from technology and some of the other names that have had huge runs here.\"\nHe said he expects the market to rise only 3 to 4 percent by the end of the year.\nIn fact, the S&P 500 has been rising so quickly, it has already topped or matched about a third of Wall Street analysts' year-end 2018 targets, collected by CNBC .\nKenny Polcari, director at O'Neill Securities, told \"Closing Bell\" he thinks the market is exhausted.\n\"It's overdone. I think the momentum has taken it so far out of line that it needs to come back,\" he said. \"It's actually healthy for the market to pull back a little bit to give [it] a chance to calm down.\"\n— CNBC's Patti Domm contributed to this report.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-17T01:17:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-17T01:24:33.004+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
