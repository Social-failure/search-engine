Millions more have been hit by a severe humanitarian crisis.\nCiting U.N. sources, Radio Okapi, which is supported by Congo’s peacekeeping mission, MONUSCO, said the assailants attacked a military post near Kananga’s airport in the early morning hours before disappearing into the surrounding bush.\nLocal authorities were not immediately reachable for comment on the attack.\nMore than a decade after the end of a 1998-2003 war in which millions of people died, mostly from hunger and disease, militia attacks are on the rise across the vast, mineral-rich nation.\nThe violence comes amid a political crisis linked to President Joseph Kabila’s refusal to step down when his mandate expired a year ago and has raised concerns that Congo could again slide into all-out war.\nReporting by Joe Bavier, editing by David Evans\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-01-14T23:44:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-14T20:22:26.003+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
