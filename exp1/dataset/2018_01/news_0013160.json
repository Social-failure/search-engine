(NasdaqGS: ABAX), a global diagnostics company manufacturing point-of-care blood analysis instruments and consumables for the medical and veterinary markets worldwide, today reported preliminary financial results for the third fiscal quarter ended December 31, 2017.\nAbaxis expects revenues in the third fiscal quarter of fiscal 2018 in a range of $59.0 million to $60.0 million, an increase of 12% to 14%, over last year's comparable quarter. In addition, Abaxis expects operating income before income tax provision in the third fiscal quarter of fiscal 2018 of $9.0 million to $10.0 million compared to $10.8 million in last year's third quarter. Abaxis expects its gross margin for the third fiscal quarter of fiscal 2018 to be between 53.5% and 54.0%.\nFollowing the recently enacted Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (\"TCJA\") on December 22, 2017, Abaxis expects its effective income tax rate to decline by 200 to 300 basis points in fiscal 2018 compared to fiscal 2017, excluding a one-time non-cash charge described below. In the third quarter of fiscal 2018, Abaxis expects its effective income tax rate to be approximately 27%, excluding a one-time non-cash charge described below. Abaxis estimates its effective income tax rate in fiscal 2019 will be lower by 1,000 to 1,200 basis points compared to fiscal 2017.\nDuring the third quarter of fiscal 2018, Abaxis expects to record a one-time non-cash charge of approximately $2.5 million to $3.5 million to its income statement as a result of TCJA. The charge is due to a reduction in deferred tax assets as a result of the reduction of the federal tax rate from 35% to 21% effective January 1, 2018. The actual impact of the TCJA on the Company's effective income tax rates may differ from the estimates above, due to changes in interpretations and assumptions made by the Company. The Company anticipates subsequent regulations associated with the TCJA will be forthcoming and will continue to analyze the tax legislation to determine the full effects of the new law on Abaxis' financial statements.\nThese estimated results for the third quarter of fiscal 2018 are preliminary and subject to change upon completion of Abaxis' quarter-end financial review process. Abaxis plans to announce its detailed earnings results on January 25, 2018.\nAbout Abaxis\nAbaxis, Inc. is a worldwide developer, manufacturer and marketer of portable blood analysis systems that are used in a broad range of medical specialties in human or veterinary patient care to provide clinicians with rapid blood constituent measurements.
