But a sustainable solution to the challenges of the new information ecosystem requires further measures,\" he said.\n\"In particular, a viable subscription model on platforms that enables publishers to build a direct relationship with readers and to manage the terms of access to their content.\" (Reporting by Aishwarya Venugopal in Bengaluru; editing by Patrick Graham)", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-12T15:35:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-13T09:01:08.002+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
