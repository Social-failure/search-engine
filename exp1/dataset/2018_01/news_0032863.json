He called the outlook for the economy “challenging” and “fragile”, despite the bank raising its growth forecasts slightly to 1.4 percent for this year and 1.6 percent for 2019.\nReporting by Mfuneko Toyana and Nqobile Dludla; Editing by Alison Williams; Writing by Alexander Winning\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-01-18T22:20:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-19T12:30:10.020+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
