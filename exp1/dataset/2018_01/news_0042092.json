Our disciplined share repurchase program, along with our quarterly dividend, has returned $183 million to shareholders during the first 6 months of fiscal 2018, demonstrating our commitment to our capital allocation priorities. Our transformation and cost reduction initiatives continue to gain traction, as operating income and operating margin increased sequentially. With the expectation of seasonally strong growth in the March quarter, additional cost reductions, and a strong balance sheet, we are well positioned to improve upon our performance in the second half of fiscal 2018 as we progress towards our long term financial objectives.”\nOutlook for Third Quarter of Fiscal 2018 Ending on March 31, 2018\nSales are expected to be in the range of $4.65 billion to $4.95 billion Adjusted diluted earnings per share 1 is expected to be in the range of $0.90 to $1.00 per share The guidance assumes 121 million average diluted shares outstanding and an adjusted tax rate of 21% to 25%\nThe above guidance excludes any additional acquisitions, any results of discontinued operations, amortization of intangibles, accelerated depreciation, any potential restructuring, integration, and other expenses and certain income tax adjustments. In addition, the above guidance assumes that the average U.S. Dollar to Euro currency exchange rate for the third quarter of fiscal 2018 is $1.21 to €1.00.

When the U.S. Dollar strengthens and the stronger exchange rates of the current year are used to translate the results of operations of Avnet’s subsidiaries denominated in foreign currencies, the resulting impact is a decrease in U.S. Dollars of reported results. Conversely, when the U.S. Dollar weakens and the weaker exchange rates of the current year are used to translate the results of operations of Avnet’s subsidiaries denominated in foreign currencies, the resulting impact is an increase in U.S. Dollars of reported results. In the discussion of the Company’s results of operations, results excluding this impact are referred to as “excluding the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates” or “constant currency.” Management believes organic sales and sales in constant currency are useful measures for evaluating current period performance as compared with prior periods and for understanding underlying trends. In order to determine the translation impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates on sales, income or expense items for subsidiaries reporting in currencies other than the U.S. Dollar, the Company adjusts the average exchange rates used in current periods to be consistent with the average exchange rates in effect during the comparative period.\nManagement believes that operating income and operating expenses adjusted for restructuring, integration and other expenses and amortization of acquired intangible assets and other, are useful measures to help investors better assess and understand the Company’s operating performance. This is especially the case when comparing results with previous periods or forecasting performance for future periods, primarily because management views the excluded items to be outside of Avnet’s normal operating results or non-cash in nature. Management analyzes operating income and operating expenses without the impact of these items as well as other income (expense) excluding certain non-recurring amounts as an indicator of ongoing margin performance and underlying trends in the business. Management also uses these non-GAAP measures to establish operational goals and, in many cases, for measuring performance for compensation purposes.\nAdditional non-GAAP metrics management uses are adjusted operating income margin, which is defined as adjusted operating income (as defined above) divided by sales and adjusted operating expense to gross profit ratio, which is defined as adjusted operating expenses (as defined above) divided by gross profit.\nManagement also believes income tax expense, income from continuing operations and diluted earnings per share from continuing operations adjusted for the impact of the items described above and certain items impacting income tax expense are useful to investors because they provide a measure of the Company’s net profitability on a more comparable basis to historical periods and provide a more meaningful basis for forecasting future performance. Additionally, because of management’s focus on generating shareholder value, of which net profitability is a primary driver, management believes income from continuing operations and diluted earnings per share from continuing operations excluding the impact of these items provides an important measure of the Company’s net profitability for the investing public.\nOther metrics management monitors in its assessment of business performance include return on working capital (ROWC), return on capital employed (ROCE) and working capital velocity (WC velocity).\nROWC is defined as annualized adjusted operating income (as defined above) divided by the sum of the monthly average balances of receivables and inventories less accounts payable from both continuing and discontinued operations. ROCE is defined as annualized, tax effected adjusted operating income (as defined above) divided by the monthly average balances of interest-bearing debt and equity (including the impact of adjustments to operating income discussed above) less cash and cash equivalents from both continuing and discontinued operations. WC velocity is defined as annualized sales divided by the sum of the monthly average balances of receivables and inventories less accounts payable.\nAny analysis of results and outlook on a non-GAAP basis should be used as a complement to, and in conjunction with, results presented in accordance with GAAP.\nQuarters Ended Fiscal Year to Date December 30, September 30, 2018 2017* 2017* ($ in thousands, except per share amounts) GAAP selling, general and administrative expenses -
