Trump dismisses any talk of collusion.\nThe Judiciary Committee’s ranking Democrat, Senator Dianne Feinstein, angered Grassley this month by releasing the transcript of the panel’s interview with Glenn Simpson, a co-founder of Fusion GPS, which researched Trump’s ties to Russia and produced a dossier denounced by the White House.\nGrassley said on Thursday Feinstein’s action “spooked” other potential witnesses, including Trump’s son-in-law and close adviser, Jared Kushner.\n“As a result, it looks like our chances of getting a voluntary interview with Mr. Kushner have been shot,” Grassley said.\nGrassley said he felt his committee’s investigation of the June 2016 Trump Tower meeting, attended by Russians and close Trump associates, was complete, so it was time to start releasing the transcripts.\n“That can hopefully be done through agreement with the Ranking Member, but if not, possibly through a Committee vote. I’d like to work on getting that done as soon as possible,” Grassley said.\nA spokesman for Feinstein did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\nDemocrats and Republicans in Congress have also been arguing this week over a memorandum commissioned by House of Representatives Republicans that Republicans say illustrates anti-Trump bias at the Federal Bureau of Investigation.\nReporting by Patricia Zengerle; Editing by Susan Thomas\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-01-26T00:28:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-26T21:32:36.009+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
