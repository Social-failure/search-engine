The '70s classic runs on bio-diesel. \nAs Osborne notes, compared to your typical gas guzzler, that means the engine has fewer parts and a lower operating cost. \n\"You drive to your favorite Chinese restaurant. When you finish dinner, you ask them for the check and also for the oil that they fried your pork fried rice in, and then just put it in the car and you drive home,\" jokes Osborne. \nIn actuality, it's \"not quite that simple at all,\" says Leno. Bio-diesel is based in vegetable oil or animal fat, but it's often blended. 1989 Morgan Plus 8 \nThis traditional English sports car, which originally sold for $35,000 at a time when manufacturers were racing to meet emission standards, runs on propane. \n\"Propane burns more efficiently than gasoline does, so it actually provides a higher octane and better combustion, which gives you more performance,\" Osborne tells Leno. \"The problem is: The infrastructure for getting propane is not that for getting gasoline,\" because, though propane is more efficient, gas is cheaper. 1953 Paxton Phoenix \nOldest and perhaps most intriguing of the three, this high-end fiberglass luxury car is a personal favorite of Osborne. It's powered by steam. \nTo produce the car, 20th century entrepreneur Robert Paxton McCulloch consulted with Abner Doble, an engineer who designed over 40 unique car prototypes and who is a personal hero of Leno's. \n\"He produced the greatest steam car ever made: The only steam car where you turn a key and drive away,\" says Leno. \"I have two of them.\" \nThe Phoenix never made it to production, notes Osborne, because of hold ups at the steam power plant. Had it gotten to the market, it would have cost around $10,000 in the early 1950s, a time when the average car cost between $2,000 and $3,000. \nThis one appreciated over 100 percent in the past five years from a value of $175,000 to $375,000. According to Osborne, that's because of a recent rise in public interest interest in one-offs, prototypes and concept cars. \nWhat about the others? Have they appreciated more or less?
