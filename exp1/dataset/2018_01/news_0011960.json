REUTERS/Clodagh Kilcoyne/File Photo \nThe think tank said it forecast quarterly growth of 0.6 percent during the fourth quarter of 2017, compared with 0.4 percent in the previous quarter. \nBased on this, NIESR said it predicted annual average economic growth for 2017 at 1.8 percent. Its forecasts followed better-than-expected industrial production data for November published earlier on Wednesday. \n“This recovery, combined with above-target CPI inflation, is consistent with a gradual withdrawal of monetary policy stimulus,” Amit Kara, NIESR’s head of UK macroeconomic forecasting, said. \nThe Bank of England was now on track to raise interest rates again in May, Kara said.
