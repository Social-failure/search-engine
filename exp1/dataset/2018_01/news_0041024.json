A total of 94,464,400 units (the “Units”) of the Company were sold at a price of $1.40 per Unit for gross proceeds of approximately $132 million.\nEach Unit consists of one Sherritt common share (a “Common Share”) and one-half of one common share purchase warrant linked to the price of cobalt (each full warrant, a “Cobalt-Linked Warrant”). Each full Cobalt-Linked Warrant will be exercisable at an exercise price of $1.95 for a period of 36 months, effective from today.\nParadigm Capital, Eight Capital and National Bank Financial acted as co-lead agents and joint-bookrunners on behalf of a syndicate that included TD Securities (collectively, the “Agents”). The Agents received a cash commission equal to 5.5% of the gross proceeds raised in consideration for their services.\nThe Cobalt-Linked Warrants are expected to begin trading on the TSX on January 25, 2018 under the symbol S.WT. Each Cobalt-Linked Warrant will be exercisable to acquire between 1.00 and 1.25 Common Shares of Sherritt, determined based on the Applicable Reference Cobalt Price (as defined below), subject to adjustment in accordance with the warrant indenture. The Cobalt-Linked Warrants have been structured to provide investors with increased leverage to upwards movement in the price of cobalt.\nEach Cobalt-Linked Warrant will entitle the holder thereof to acquire that number of Common Shares that is equal to the Common Shares per Warrant Ratio. The Common Shares per Warrant Ratio will be determined and published on the fifth business day of each month, based on the Applicable Reference Cobalt Price per Pound in accordance with the following table:\nApplicable Reference Cobalt Price per Pound\nUS$34.99 or lower\nUS$35.00 – US$39.99\nUS$40.00 – US$44.99\nUS$45.00 – US$49.99\nUS$50.00 – US$54.99\nUS$55.00 and higher\nCommon Shares per Warrant Ratio\n1.00\n1.05\n1.10\n1.15\n1.20\n1.25\nThe Applicable Reference Cobalt Price per Pound will be calculated and published by Sherritt monthly, based on a rolling average of the prior three consecutive full calendar months’ cobalt price using the midpoint of the Metal Bulletin High Price and the Metal Bulletin Low Price 1 , expressed in US dollars per pound, for each month in such three-month period. The initial Common Shares per Warrant Ratio will be 1.0 based on an initial Applicable Reference Cobalt Price of US$31.60. The next Applicable Reference Cobalt Price and Common Shares per Warrant Ratio will be published on February 7, 2018.\nThe net proceeds of the Offering will be used to reduce Sherritt’s outstanding indebtedness, for general corporate purposes and to fund future growth initiatives. Sherritt intends to use the proceeds of the Offering and its existing cash balance to repurchase a portion of one or more of each of its senior unsecured debentures (the “Debentures”) for a targeted aggregate principal amount of up to $75 million. The Debentures will be repurchased under the terms of a modified Dutch auction tender offer (the “Tender Offer”). For further details of the Tender Offer, investors are advised to consult Sherritt’s press release dated January 16, 2018, entitled Sherritt Announces Dutch Auction to Purchase up to $75 Million of Outstanding Debentures.\nThe securities described herein have not been, and will not be, registered under the U.S. Securities Act, or any state securities laws, and accordingly, may not be offered or sold to, or for the account or benefit of, persons in the United States or to U.S. Persons (as such term is defined in Regulation S under the U.S. Securities Act), except in compliance with the registration requirements of the U.S. Securities Act and applicable state securities requirements or pursuant to exemptions therefrom.
