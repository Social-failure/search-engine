The result was also impacted by the deconsolidation of its Baltic operations, where Nordea has merged with Norway’s DNB .\nThe company said it was confident its net profit would grow this year, and it expected to see slightly higher revenues, lower costs and a stable credit quality.\nThe bank raised its proposed dividend to 0.68 euro per share from 0.65 euro last year and slightly higher than the 0.67 euro forecast by analysts. The bank’s ambition is to achieve a yearly increase in dividend.\nNet interest income, which includes income from mortgages and loans to companies, came in at 1.11 billion euros compared with 1.21 billion a year ago, lower than the expected 1.15 billion, while commission income also missed analysts’ expectations.\nTotal costs rose to 1.36 billion euros from 1.23 billion a year ago, slightly less than the 1.38 billion seen by analysts.\n$1 = 0.8034 euros Reporting by Johan Ahlander, Editing by Niklas Pollard and Sherry Jacob-Phillips\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-01-25T15:21:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-26T21:23:32.001+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
