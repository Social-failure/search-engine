It first funded itself by collecting $600,000 from individual angel investors. \nWhile inspired by bitcoin, the system is not yet on blockchain, a record-keeping system that is designed to make transactions irreversible, Fomenko said. It is also not formally convertible into established currencies, as widely traded, often volatile cryptocurrencies can be, he said. \nFomenko plans eventually to develop the technical and security features to enable it to be listed on cryptocurrency exchanges, creating a marketplace for movement, he said. \nThese and other money-making plans have been put on hold while the 10-member Sweatcoin team struggles to satisfy growing volumes of consumers using its basic fitness tracking features. Co-founder Anton Derlyatka said Sweatcoin had 2.28 million active users who have counted their steps on Tuesday this week. \nIt’s a successful second act for Fomenko, whose last start-up, Bloom.fm, a music app launched in 2013, drew 1.3 million downloads before imploding when its sole investor, a unit of Gazprom Media, pulled out after Russia’s invasion of Crimea. ( reut.rs/2mNVg2S ) \nLondon-based Sweatcoin has ranked as the top health and fitness app in both countries since September 2017 and is among the most downloaded apps of all types on both the Apple iOS and Google Play stores.
