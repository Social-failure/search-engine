Its request for $812 million in 2017 was only about half funded.\n“The Congolese government and the international community must re-engage on all fronts to prevent a major famine in Kasai,” Jibidar said in a statement. “Failure to do so, immediately and collectively, means many people will die.”\nMore than 3,000 people have been killed and at least 1.7 million forced to flee their homes in Kasai since the start of the insurrection by the Kamuina Nsapu militia, which wants military forces to withdraw from the region.\nThe conflict has driven farmers from their land and disrupted three consecutive planting seasons, leaving people in an area which depends heavily on agriculture with very little to eat, according to the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO).\n“Agriculture is the only way to become productive again,” said FAO representative Alexis Bonte.\n“Not only does it generate food and income for families, but it restores hope, dignity and self-reliance.”\nChildren in Kasai have been hit hardest by the fighting, with 400,000 of those aged five or under severely malnourished, said Tajudeen Oyewale of the U.N. children’s agency (UNICEF).\n“They are likely to die unless they urgently receive health, water, sanitation and nutrition support,” he said.\nEthnic violence in Congo, Africa’s second-largest country, has spread and worsened since December 2016 when President Joseph Kabila refused to step down at the end of his mandate.\nReporting by Karla Mendes.
