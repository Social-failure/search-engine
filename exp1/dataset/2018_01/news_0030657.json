The bodies of two sailors were recovered from the ship while a third body was pulled from the sea near the vessel. The remaining 29 crew of the ship are presumed dead.\nThe Chinese Ministry of Transport said on Wednesday a salvage team had located the wreck, which was at a depth of 115 meters (377 feet) under sea level, and was preparing to send underwater robots to explore it.\nThe SOA said in its statement late on Wednesday it had collected water samples from 19 spill sites, and found water from five sites had petroleum substances at levels exceeding standards.\nThe oil spill from a stricken Iranian tanker Sanchi that sank on Sunday is seen in the East China Sea, on January 17, 2018 in this photo provided by Japan's 10th Regional Coast Guard. 10th Regional Coast Guard Headquarters/Handout via REUTERS Clean-up teams were continuing to monitor the wreck area to assess the drift and diffusion of the oil spill and the ecological impact.\nOne of the slicks, about 18 kms in length and 300 meters wide, was found about 11 kms north of the sunken tanker, and another, about 20 kms long and about 500 meters wide, was found 2 kms southwest of the wreck, it said.\nSlideshow (2 Images) The Sanchi had been adrift and ablaze after crashing into the freighter CF Crystal (IMO:9497050) on Jan. 6. Strong winds pushed it away from the Chinese coast, where the incident happened, and into Japanâ€™s exclusive economic zone.\nThe ship was carrying 136,000 tonnes or almost 1 million barrels of condensate - an ultra-light, highly flammable crude oil.\n(This story has been refiled to change statement issued to Wednesday, not Thursday)\nReporting by Dominique Patton; editing by Richard Pullin\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-18T04:29:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-18T04:39:04.023+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
