He most recently has been working as a television analyst.\nThe Colts, meanwhile, thanked Pagano for his body of work, while at the same time showing him the door.\n“Chuck’s first season was one of the more inspirational stories in NFL history as he courageously battled and overcame leukemia,” Colts Owner & CEO Jim Irsay said in a statement.\nPagano, speaking before his firing had been announced, said: “I‘m just grateful I‘m on this side of the dirt,” referring to his recovery from leukemia.\nPagano guided the Colts to a 56-46 overall record (including the post-season) after joining the team in 2012.\nHe led them to three consecutive 11-5 seasons and playoff appearances from 2012-14, which included the 2014 AFC Championship game.\nBut the team failed to compile a winning record the past three seasons as they were hampered by multiple injuries to quarterback Andrew Luck.\nDel Rio and Pagano are likely to be joined by several other sacked head coaches over the next couple of days.\nBen McAdoo of the New York Giants was the only head coach fired during the season.\nReporting by Andrew Both in Cary, North Carolina; Editing by Greg Stutchbury\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-01-01T07:28:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-01T03:56:08.003+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
