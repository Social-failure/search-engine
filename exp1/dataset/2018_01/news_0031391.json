A major investor in Turkey, the bank says its has invested 10 billion euros to date, almost all of that in the private sector. \nEBRD President Suma Chakrabarti is visiting Turkey on Thursday and Friday to meet with government officials and company representatives. \nAnkara and officials from the EBRD last year denied speculation that European institutions, including the EBRD, would stop funds to Turkey after relations with Germany soured. \nEBRDâ€™s first investment in Turkey since then came earlier this month when Turkish firm YDA issued a 400 million lira (75.9 million pounds) bond, for which the bank provided 90 million lira in funding.
