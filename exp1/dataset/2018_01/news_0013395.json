Relief and Works Agency for Palestinian refugees.\nThe United States is the largest donor to UNRWA, with a pledge of nearly $370 million as of 2016, according to the organization’s website.\nLast Tuesday, President Donald Trump said the United States may withhold future aid payments to Palestinians, accusing them of being unwilling to talk peace with Israel. Earlier, his U.N. Ambassador Nikki Haley said the future U.S. funding for UNRWA was under review.\nA State Department official later said that no decision had been made on payment.\n“We’re just trying to sort out what the exact information is on that,” Skoog said on Tuesday, adding that he has brought the subject up bilaterally with Haley.\nRelations between the Palestinians and Washington soured last month after Trump announced the United States would recognize Jerusalem as Israel’s capital, generating outrage across the Arab world and concern among Washington’s Western allies.\nPalestinians want East Jerusalem as the capital of a state they seek to establish in the West Bank and Gaza Strip.\nPalestinian officials have said Trump’s declaration on Jerusalem meant he could not serve as an honest broker in peace negotiations with Israel that Washington has been trying to revive.\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu repeated over the weekend his call for UNRWA to be dismantled.\nReporting by Rodrigo Campos; Editing by Susan Thomas\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-09T19:41:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-09T19:49:20.005+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
