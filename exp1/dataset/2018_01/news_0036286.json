I love playing for England and I don’t like missing games of cricket,” said Root, who suffered from dehydration, diarrhoea and vomiting because of viral gastroenteritis during the final Ashes test. \n”I had a long chat with (England coach) Trevor Bayliss about things and there’s obviously a big summer ahead and a lot of cricket still to be played. It’s going to be really important to make sure that I‘m available for all of that. \n“The decision has been made to have a little break. I‘m sure when I‘m at home I will be sat watching and willing the lads on.” Writing by Ken Ferris; Editing by Greg Stutchbury", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-23T01:50:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-23T02:20:14.009+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
