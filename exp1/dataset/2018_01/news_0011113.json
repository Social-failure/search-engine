'A good thing' \nThe State Department had said Pyongyang \"might be trying to drive a wedge\" between Washington and Seoul and weaken a U.S.-led campaign to force North Korea to give up its development of nuclear-tipped missiles capable of hitting the United States. \nU.S. President Donald Trump spent much of the past year deriding negotiations as useless and lobbing insults at North Korean leader Kim Jong Un , but recently Trump called the new talks \"a good thing\" and said they had been prompted by his \"firm, strong\" stance. \nTrump has said he would like to see talks go beyond the Olympics and added: \"At the appropriate time, we'll get involved.\" \nA spokeswoman for the U.S. State Department, Katina Adams, did not respond directly when asked about suggestions from some South Korean officials that the two Koreas could march under a single flag at the Olympic opening ceremony and even compete as a single nation in some events, but said: \"We are in close contact with the Republic of Korea about our unified response to North Korea, including the need to maintain pressure to achieve a denuclearized Korean Peninsula. \n\"Diplomatic options remain viable and open and the United States remains committed to finding a peaceful path to denuclearising the Korean Peninsula.\" \nAt the same time, Adams said Washington remained \"clear-eyed about (North Korea's) track record when it comes to negotiations\" and added: \"Time will tell if this is a genuine gesture.\" \nU.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson reiterated last week that any future talks between the United States and North Korea must be aimed at denuclearization and warned that diplomatic efforts were backed by a strong military option if necessary. \nU.S. Defense Secretary James Mattis and Japanese Defense Minister Itsunori Onodera spoke by phone on Monday and discussed \"the importance of maximizing pressure\" on North Korea to abandons its nuclear and missile programs, the Pentagon said in a statement. \nSouth Korea and the United States have agreed to delay joint military exercises until after the Olympics in a bid to reduce tensions and possibly create room for diplomacy. \nThe talks come after North Korea's Kim used his New Year's Day speech to announce he was open to sending a delegation to the Olympics as well as reducing tensions on the Korean peninsula, while vowing to never give up his nuclear weapons program. \nNorth Korea's delegation will be led by Ri Son Gwon, chairman of the North's Committee for the Peaceful Reunification of the Fatherland. Committee vice chairman Jon Song Su and Hwang Chung Song, a director, will join Ri. \nRi, the committee chairman who was promoted to his current position in June 2016, is a seasoned negotiator for inter-Korean talks although his previous experience has mostly been military-related due to his career in the armed forces.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-09T05:17:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-09T10:21:10.030+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
