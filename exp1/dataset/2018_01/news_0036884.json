(NYSE: PLD), the global leader in logistics real estate, today reported results for the fourth quarter and full year 2017.\nNet earnings per diluted share was $0.55 for the quarter and $3.06 for the year compared with $0.82 and $2.27 for the same periods in 2016. The year-over-year increase is principally due to higher gains on real estate transactions, stronger operating results and higher net promote income.\nCore funds from operations* per diluted share was $0.67 for the quarter and $2.81 for the year compared with $0.63 and $2.57 for the same periods in 2016. The year-over-year increase is due primarily to stronger operating results and higher net promote income.\n\"Our results are a testament to our high-quality portfolio, proven strategy and strong execution by our global team,\" said Hamid R. Moghadam, chairman and CEO, Prologis. \"We are starting 2018 with even more embedded rental upside than we had last year. Looking forward, it's all about using our scale and expertise to drive organic growth, put our global land bank to work and deliver further value from our customer relationships.\"\nOPERATING RESULTS REMAIN EXCELLENT\nOwned & Managed\n4Q17\n4Q16\nNotes\nPeriod End Occupancy\n97.2%\n97.1%\nRecord and led by the U.S. at 98.0%\nLeases Signed\n42MSF\n39MSF\nPrologis Share\n4Q17\n4Q16\nNotes\nNet Effective Rent Change\n19.0%\n16.0%\nLed by the U.S. at 29.8%\nCash Rent Change\n8.8%\n7.0%\nNet Effective Same Store NOI*\n4.1%\n3.2%\nLed by the U.S. at 5.4%\nCash Same Store NOI*\n5.5%\n4.4%\nLed by the U.S. at 6.8%\nSTRONG CUSTOMER RELATIONSHIPS DRIVE RECORD BUILD-TO-SUIT ACTIVITY\nPrologis Share\n4Q17\nFY2017\nBuilding Acquisitions\n$79M\n$185M\nWeighted avg stabilized cap rate\n5.6%\n5.6%\nDevelopment Stabilizations\n$525M\n$2,037M\nEstimated weighted avg yield\n6.9%\n6.6%\nEstimated weighted avg margin\n29.0%\n28.6%\nEstimated value creation\n$152M\n$583M\n% Build-to-suit\n46.4%\n34.9%\nDevelopment Starts\n$692M\n$2,332M\nEstimated weighted avg margin\n19.5%\n19.1%\nEstimated value creation\n$135M\n$446M\n% Build-to-suit\n43.3%\n47.1%\nDispositions and Contributions\n$839M\n$2,528M\nWeighted avg stabilized cap rate (excluding land and other real estate)\n6.0%\n5.5%\nBEST-IN-CLASS BALANCE SHEET PRIMED FOR GROWTH\nDuring the fourth quarter, Prologis and its co-investment ventures completed $1.9 billion of refinancings and redeemed $788 million of near-term bonds. For the full year, on a look-through basis, the company reduced its leverage by 340 basis points to 23.7 percent on a market capitalization basis and improved its debt-to-adjusted EBITDA* by approximately 0.2x to 4.6x.\nCOMPANY ESTABLISHES 2018 EARNINGS GUIDANCE RANGES\nThe company established a guidance range for net earnings per diluted share of $2.10 to $2.25 and a range for Core FFO* per diluted share of $2.85 to $2.95.\n\"Strong operating fundamentals will translate to robust earnings growth in 2018,\" said Thomas S. Olinger, chief financial officer, Prologis. \"Fueled by same store NOI growth, Core FFO, excluding promotes, is expected to increase 7 percent at the midpoint. This represents very strong growth, given that we anticipate further delevering of our already conservative balance sheet.\"\n2018 GUIDANCE\nEarnings (per diluted share)\nNet Earnings\n$2.10 to $2.25\nCore FFO*\n$2.85 to $2.95\nOperations\nYear-end occupancy\n96.0% to 97.0%\nNet Effective Same Store NOI – Prologis share*\n4.0% to 5.0%\nOther Assumptions (in millions)\nStrategic capital revenue, excl. promote revenue\n$260 to $270\nNet promote income\n$30 to $40\nGeneral & administrative expenses\n$227 to $237\nRealized development gains\n$300 to $400\nCapital Deployment (Prologis Share, in millions)\nPrologis Share\nOwned and Managed\nDevelopment stabilizations\n$1,800 to $2,000\n$2,100 to $2,300\nDevelopment starts\n$2,000 to $2,300\n$2,500 to $2,900\nBuilding acquisitions\n$300 to $500\n$500 to $800\nBuilding and land dispositions\n$950 to $1,200\n$1,600 to $2,000\nBuilding contributions\n$1,350 to $1,650\n$1,800 to $2,200\nThe earnings guidance described above includes potential future gains recognized from real estate transactions but excludes any future foreign currency or derivative gains or losses as these items are difficult to predict. In reconciling from net earnings to Core FFO*, Prologis makes certain adjustments, including but not limited to real estate depreciation and amortization expense, gains (losses) recognized from real estate transactions and early extinguishment of debt, impairment charges, deferred taxes and unrealized gains or losses on foreign currency or derivative activity. The difference between the company's Core FFO* and net earnings guidance for 2018 relates predominantly to these items. Please refer to our fourth quarter Supplemental Information, which is available on our Investor Relations website at www.ir.prologis.com and on the SEC's website at www.sec.gov for a definition of Core FFO* and other non-GAAP measures used by Prologis, along with reconciliations of these items to the closest GAAP measure for our results and guidance.\nWEBCAST & CONFERENCE CALL INFORMATION\nPrologis will host a live webcast and conference call to discuss quarterly results, current market conditions and outlook.

These forward-looking statements are based on current expectations, estimates and projections about the industry and markets in which we operate as well as management's beliefs and assumptions. Such statements involve uncertainties that could significantly impact our financial results. Words such as \"expects,\" \"anticipates,\" \"intends,\" \"plans,\" \"believes,\" \"seeks,\" \"estimates\" and variations of such words and similar expressions are intended to identify such forward-looking statements, which generally are not historical in nature. All statements that address operating performance, events or developments that we expect or anticipate will occur in the future — including statements relating to rent and occupancy growth, development activity and changes in sales or contribution volume of properties, disposition activity, general conditions in the geographic areas where we operate, our debt, capital structure and financial position, our ability to form new co-investment ventures and the availability of capital in existing or new co-investment ventures — are forward-looking statements. These statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve certain risks, uncertainties and assumptions that are difficult to predict. Although we believe the expectations reflected in any forward-looking statements are based on reasonable assumptions, we can give no assurance that our expectations will be attained and therefore, actual outcomes and results may differ materially from what is expressed or forecasted in such forward-looking statements. Some of the factors that may affect outcomes and results include, but are not limited to: (i) national, international, regional and local economic climates, (ii) changes in financial markets, interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates, (iii) increased or unanticipated competition for our properties, (iv) risks associated with acquisitions, dispositions and development of properties, (v) maintenance of real estate investment trust status, tax structuring and income tax rates (vi) availability of financing and capital, the levels of debt that we maintain and our credit ratings, (vii) risks related to our investments in our co-investment ventures, including our ability to establish new co-investment ventures and funds, (viii) risks of doing business internationally, including currency risks, (ix) environmental uncertainties, including risks of natural disasters, and (x) those additional factors discussed in reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission by us under the heading \"Risk Factors.\" We undertake no duty to update any forward-looking statements appearing in this document.\n*This is a non-GAAP financial measure.

We use Adjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP financial measure, as a measure of our operating performance. The most directly comparable GAAP measure to Adjusted EBITDA is net earnings.\nWe calculate Adjusted EBITDA beginning with consolidated net earnings attributable to common stockholders and removing the effect of: interest expense, income taxes, depreciation and amortization, impairment charges, third party acquisition expenses related to the acquisition of real estate, gains or losses from the disposition of investments in real estate (excluding development properties and land), gains from the revaluation of equity investments upon acquisition of a controlling interest, gains or losses on early extinguishment of debt and derivative contracts (including cash charges), similar adjustments we make to our FFO measures (see definition below), and other items, such as, stock based compensation and unrealized gains or losses on foreign currency and derivatives. We also include a pro forma adjustment to reflect a full period of NOI on the operating properties we acquire or stabilize during the quarter and to remove NOI on properties we dispose of during the quarter, assuming all transactions occurred at the beginning of the quarter. The pro forma adjustment also includes economic ownership changes in our ventures to reflect the full quarter at the new ownership percentage.\nWe believe Adjusted EBITDA provides investors relevant and useful information because it permits investors to view our operating performance, analyze our ability to meet interest payment obligations and make quarterly preferred stock dividends on an unleveraged basis before the effects of income tax, non-cash depreciation and amortization expense, gains and losses on the disposition of non-development properties and other items (outlined above), that affect comparability. While all items are not infrequent or unusual in nature, these items may result from market fluctuations that can have inconsistent effects on our results of operations. The economics underlying these items reflect market and financing conditions in the short-term but can obscure our performance and the value of our long-term investment decisions and strategies.\nWhile we believe Adjusted EBITDA is an important measure, it should not be used alone because it excludes significant components of net earnings, such as our historical cash expenditures or future cash requirements for working capital, capital expenditures, distribution requirements, contractual commitments or interest and principal payments on our outstanding debt and is therefore limited as an analytical tool.\nOur computation of Adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to EBITDA reported by other companies in both the real estate industry and other industries. We compensate for the limitations of Adjusted EBITDA by providing investors with financial statements prepared according to GAAP, along with this detailed discussion of Adjusted EBITDA and a reconciliation to Adjusted EBITDA from consolidated net earnings attributable to common stockholders.\nBusiness Line Reporting is a non-GAAP financial measure . Core FFO and development gains are generated by our three lines of business: (i) real estate operations; (ii) strategic capital; and (iii) development. The real estate operations line of business represents total Prologis Core FFO, less the amount allocated to the Strategic Capital line of business. The amount of Core FFO allocated to the Strategic Capital line of business represents the third party share of asset management and transactional fees that we earn from our consolidated and unconsolidated co-investment ventures less costs directly associated to our strategic capital group, plus development management income. Realized development gains include our share of gains on dispositions of development properties and land, net of taxes. To calculate the per share amount, the amount generated by each line of business is divided by the weighted average diluted common shares outstanding used in our Core FFO per share calculation. Management believes evaluating our results by line of business is a useful supplemental measure of our operating performance because it helps the investing public compare the operating performance of Prologis' respective businesses to other companies' comparable businesses. Prologis' computation of FFO by line of business may not be comparable to that reported by other real estate investment trusts as they may use different methodologies in computing such measures.\nCalculation of Per Share Amounts\nin thousands, except per share amount\nThree Months Ended\nTwelve Months Ended\nDec. 31,\nDec. 31,\n2017\n2016\n2017\n2016\nNet earnings\nNet earnings\n$\n295,515\n$\n440,539\n$\n1,641,931\n$\n1,203,218\nNoncontrolling interest attributable to exchangeable limited partnership units\n8,153\n12,600\n46,280\n37,079\nAdjusted net earnings - Diluted\n$\n303,668\n$\n453,139\n$\n1,688,211\n$\n1,240,297\nWeighted average common shares outstanding - Basic\n531,478\n528,012\n530,400\n526,103\nIncremental weighted average effect on exchange of limited partnership units\n15,336\n15,869\n15,945\n16,833\nIncremental weighted average effect of equity awards\n7,587\n7,004\n5,955\n3,730\nWeighted average common shares outstanding - Diluted\n554,401\n550,885\n552,300\n546,666\nNet earnings per share - Basic\n$\n0.56\n$\n0.83\n$\n3.10\n$\n2.29\nNet earnings per share - Diluted\n$\n0.55\n$\n0.82\n$\n3.06\n$\n2.27\nCore FFO\nCore FFO\n$\n373,267\n$\n344,787\n$\n1,551,153\n$\n1,400,498\nNoncontrolling interest attributable to exchangeable limited partnership units\n415\n991\n2,903\n4,273\nCore FFO - Diluted\n$\n373,682\n$\n345,778\n$\n1,554,056\n$\n1,404,771\nWeighted average common shares outstanding - Basic\n531,478\n528,012\n530,400\n526,103\nIncremental weighted average effect on exchange of limited partnership units\n15,336\n15,869\n15,945\n16,833\nIncremental weighted average effect of equity awards\n7,587\n7,004\n5,955\n3,730\nWeighted average common shares outstanding - Diluted\n554,401\n550,885\n552,300\n546,666\nCore FFO per share - Diluted\n$\n0.67\n$\n0.63\n$\n2.81\n$\n2.57\nEstimated Value Creation represents the value that we expect to create through our development and leasing activities. We calculate Value Creation by estimating the Stabilized NOI that the property will generate and applying a stabilized capitalization rate applicable to that property. Estimated Value Creation is calculated as the amount by which the value exceeds our total expected investment and does not include any fees or promotes we may earn. Estimated Value Creation for our Value-Added Properties that are sold includes the realized economic gain.\nEstimated Weighted Average Margin is calculated on development properties as Estimated Value Creation, less estimated closing costs and taxes, if any, on properties expected to be sold or contributed, divided by TEI.\nEstimated Weighted Average Stabilized Yield is calculated on development properties as Stabilized NOI divided by TEI.\nFFO, as modified by Prologis attributable to common stockholders/unitholders (\"FFO, as modified by Prologis\"); Core FFO attributable to common stockholders/unitholders (\"Core FFO\"); AFFO; (collectively referred to as \"FFO\"). FFO is a non-GAAP financial measure that is commonly used in the real estate industry. The most directly comparable GAAP measure to FFO is net earnings.\nThe National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts (\"NAREIT\") defines FFO as earnings computed under GAAP to exclude historical cost depreciation and gains and losses from the sales, along with impairment charges, of previously depreciated properties. We also exclude the gains on revaluation of equity investments upon acquisition of a controlling interest and the gain recognized from a partial sale of our investment, as these are similar to gains from the sales of previously depreciated properties. We exclude similar adjustments from our unconsolidated entities and the third parties' share of our consolidated co-investment ventures.\nOur FFO Measures\nOur FFO measures begin with NAREIT's definition and we make certain adjustments to reflect our business and the way that management plans and executes our business strategy. While not infrequent or unusual, the additional items we adjust for in calculating FFO, as modified by Prologis, Core FFO and AFFO, as defined below, are subject to significant fluctuations from period to period. Although these items may have a material impact on our operations and are reflected in our financial statements, the removal of the effects of these items allows us to better understand the core operating performance of our properties over the long term. These items have both positive and negative short-term effects on our results of operations in inconsistent and unpredictable directions that are not relevant to our long-term outlook.\nWe calculate our FFO measures, as defined below, based on our proportionate ownership share of both our unconsolidated and consolidated ventures. We reflect our share of our FFO measures for unconsolidated ventures by applying our average ownership percentage for the period to the applicable reconciling items on an entity by entity basis. We reflect our share for consolidated ventures in which we do not own 100% of the equity by adjusting our FFO measures to remove the noncontrolling interests share of the applicable reconciling items based on our average ownership percentage for the applicable periods.\nThese FFO measures are used by management as supplemental financial measures of operating performance and we believe that it is important that stockholders, potential investors and financial analysts understand the measures management uses. We do not use our FFO measures as, nor should they be considered to be, alternatives to net earnings computed under GAAP, as indicators of our operating performance, as alternatives to cash from operating activities computed under GAAP or as indicators of our ability to fund our cash needs.\nWe analyze our operating performance primarily by the rental revenues of our real estate and the revenues from our strategic capital business, net of operating, administrative and financing expenses. This income stream is not directly impacted by fluctuations in the market value of our investments in real estate or debt securities.\nFFO, as modified by Prologis\nTo arrive at FFO, as modified by Prologis, we adjust the NAREIT defined FFO measure to exclude the impact of foreign currency related items and deferred tax, specifically:\n(i)\ndeferred income tax benefits and deferred income tax expenses recognized by our subsidiaries;\n(ii)\ncurrent income tax expense related to acquired tax liabilities that were recorded as deferred tax liabilities in an acquisition, to the extent the expense is offset with a deferred income tax benefit in earnings that is excluded from our defined FFO measure;\n(iii)\nunhedged foreign currency exchange gains and losses resulting from debt transactions between us and our foreign consolidated subsidiaries and our foreign unconsolidated entities;\n(iv)\nforeign currency exchange gains and losses from the remeasurement (based on current foreign currency exchange rates) of certain third party debt of our foreign consolidated and unconsolidated entities; and\n(v)\nmark-to-market adjustments associated with derivative financial instruments.\nWe use FFO, as modified by Prologis, so that management, analysts and investors are able to evaluate our performance against other REITs that do not have similar operations or operations in jurisdictions outside the U.S.\nCore FFO\nIn addition to FFO, as modified by Prologis, we also use Core FFO. To arrive at Core FFO, we adjust FFO, as modified by Prologis, to exclude the following recurring and nonrecurring items that we recognized directly in FFO, as modified by Prologis:\n(i)\ngains or losses from the disposition of land and development properties that were developed with the intent to contribute or sell;\n(ii)\nincome tax expense related to the sale of investments in real estate and third-party acquisition costs related to the acquisition of real estate;\n(iii)\nimpairment charges recognized related to our investments in real estate generally as a result of our change in intent to contribute or sell these properties;\n(iv)\ngains or losses from the early extinguishment of debt and redemption and repurchase of preferred stock; and\n(v)\nexpenses related to natural disasters.\nWe use Core FFO, including by segment and region, to: (i) assess our operating performance as compared to other real estate companies, (ii) evaluate our performance and the performance of our properties in comparison with expected results and results of previous periods; (iii) evaluate the performance of our management; (iv) budget and forecast future results to assist in the allocation of resources; (v) provide guidance to the financial markets to understand our expected operating performance; and (v) evaluate how a specific potential investment will impact our future results.\nAFFO\nTo arrive at AFFO, we adjust Core FFO to include realized gains from the disposition of land and development properties and recurring capital expenditures and exclude the following items that we recognize directly in Core FFO:\n(i)\nstraight-line rents;\n(ii)\namortization of above- and below-market lease intangibles;\n(iii)\namortization of management contracts;\n(iv)\namortization of debt premiums and discounts and financing costs, net of amounts capitalized, and;\n(v)\nstock compensation expense.\nWe use AFFO to (i) assess our operating performance as compared to other real estate companies, (ii) evaluate our performance and the performance of our properties in comparison with expected results and results of previous periods, (iii) evaluate the performance of our management, (iv) budget and forecast future results to assist in the allocation of resources, and (v) evaluate how a specific potential investment will impact our future results.\nLimitations on the use of our FFO measures\nWhile we believe our modified FFO measures are important supplemental measures, neither NAREIT's nor our measures of FFO should be used alone because they exclude significant economic components of net earnings computed under GAAP and are, therefore, limited as an analytical tool. Accordingly, these are only a few of the many measures we use when analyzing our business. Some of the limitations are:\nThe current income tax expenses and acquisition costs that are excluded from our modified FFO measures represent the taxes and transaction costs that are payable. Depreciation and amortization of real estate assets are economic costs that are excluded from FFO. FFO is limited, as it does not reflect the cash requirements that may be necessary for future replacements of the real estate assets. Furthermore, the amortization of capital expenditures and leasing costs necessary to maintain the operating performance of logistics facilities are not reflected in FFO. Gains or losses from non-development property and dispositions or impairment charges related to expected dispositions represent changes in value of the properties. By excluding these gains and losses, FFO does not capture realized changes in the value of disposed properties arising from changes in market conditions. The deferred income tax benefits and expenses that are excluded from our modified FFO measures result from the creation of a deferred income tax asset or liability that may have to be settled at some future point. Our modified FFO measures do not currently reflect any income or expense that may result from such settlement. The foreign currency exchange gains and losses that are excluded from our modified FFO measures are generally recognized based on movements in foreign currency exchange rates through a specific point in time. The ultimate settlement of our foreign currency-denominated net assets is indefinite as to timing and amount. Our FFO measures are limited in that they do not reflect the current period changes in these net assets that result from periodic foreign currency exchange rate movements. The gains and losses on extinguishment of debt that we exclude from our Core FFO, may provide a benefit or cost to us as we may be settling our debt at less or more than our future obligation. The natural disaster expenses that we exclude from Core FFO are costs that we have incurred.\nWe compensate for these limitations by using our FFO measures only in conjunction with net earnings computed under GAAP when making our decisions. This information should be read with our complete Consolidated Financial Statements prepared under GAAP. To assist investors in compensating for these limitations, we reconcile our modified FFO measures to our net earnings computed under GAAP.\nGuidance. The following is a reconciliation of our annual guided Net Earnings per share to our guided Core FFO per share:\nLow\nHigh\nNet Earnings\n$\n2.10\n$\n2.25\nOur share of:\nDepreciation and amortization\n1.69\n1.74\nNet gains on real estate transactions, net of taxes\n(0.94)\n(1.04)\nUnrealized foreign currency losses and other, net\n0.00\n0.00\nCore FFO\n$\n2.85\n$\n2.95\nPrologis Share represents our proportionate economic ownership of each entity included in our total owned and managed portfolio whether consolidated or unconsolidated.\nRent Change (Cash) represents the change in starting rental rates per the lease agreement, on new and renewed leases, signed during the periods as compared with the previous ending rental rates in that same space. This measure excludes any free rent periods and teaser rates defined as 50% or less of the stabilized rate.\nRent Change (Net Effective) represents the change in net effective rental rates (average rate over the lease term), on new and renewed leases, signed during the period as compared with the previous effective rental rates in that same space.\nSame Store. We evaluate the operating performance of the operating properties we own and manage using a \"same store\" analysis because the population of properties in this analysis is consistent from period to period, which eliminates the effects of changes in the composition of the portfolio. We have defined the same store portfolio, for the three months ended December 31, 2017, as those owned and managed properties that were in operation at January 1, 2016 and have been in operation throughout the same three-month periods in both 2016 and 2017 (including development properties that have been completed and available for lease). We have removed all properties that were disposed of to a third party or were classified as held for sale to a third party from the population for both periods. We believe the factors that affect rental revenues, rental expenses and NOI in the same store portfolio are generally the same as for the total operating portfolio. To derive an appropriate measure of period-to-period operating performance, we remove the effects of foreign currency exchange rate movements by using the recent period end exchange rate to translate from local currency into the U.S. dollar, for both periods.\nSame store is a commonly used measure in the real estate industry. Our same store measures are non-GAAP financial measures that are calculated beginning with rental revenues, rental recoveries and rental expenses from the financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP. It is also common in the real estate industry and expected from the analyst and investor community that these numbers be further adjusted to remove certain non-cash items included in the financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP to reflect a cash same store number. In order to clearly label these metrics, we call one Same Store NOI and one Same Store NOI – Cash. As our same store measures are non-GAAP financial measures, they have certain limitations as analytical tools and may vary among real estate companies. As a result, we provide a reconciliation from our financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP to same store property NOI with explanations of how these metrics are calculated.\nThe following is a reconciliation of our consolidated rental revenues, rental recoveries, rental expenses and property NOI, as included in the Consolidated Statements of Operations, to the respective amounts in our same store portfolio analysis:\ndollars in thousands\nThree Months Ended\nDec. 31,\n2017\n2016\nChange (%)\nRental revenues:\nRental revenues\n$\n433,568\n$\n435,722\nRental recoveries\n117,081\n124,163\nPer the Consolidated Statements of Operations\n550,649\n559,885\nProperties not included and other adjustments (a)\n(82,049)\n(65,536)\nUnconsolidated co-investment ventures\n525,164\n463,858\nSame Store - rental revenues\n$\n993,764\n$\n958,207\n3.7\n%\nRental expenses:\nPer the Consolidated Statements of Operations\n$\n140,338\n$\n141,050\nProperties not included and other adjustments (b)\n(13,986)\n(8,314)\nUnconsolidated co-investment ventures\n123,928\n104,962\nSame Store - rental expenses\n$\n250,280\n$\n237,698\n5.3\n%\nNOI:\nConsolidated NOI\n$\n410,311\n$\n418,835\nProperties not included and other adjustments\n(68,063)\n(57,222)\nUnconsolidated Co-Investment Ventures\n401,236\n358,896\nSame Store - NOI\n$\n743,484\n$\n720,509\n3.2\n%\nSame Store - NOI - Prologis Share (c)\n$\n426,803\n$\n409,982\n4.1\n%\nNOI- Cash:\nSame store- NOI\n$\n743,484\n$\n720,509\nStraight-line rent adjustments (d)\n(9,591)\n(13,635)\nFair value lease adjustments (d)\n532\n(1,089)\nSame Store - NOI- Cash\n$\n734,425\n$\n705,785\n4.1\n%\nSame Store - NOI- Prologis Share (c)\n$\n423,606\n$\n401,530\n5.5\n%\n(a)\nTo calculate Same Store rental income, we exclude net termination and renegotiation fees to allow us to evaluate the growth or decline in each property's rental income without regard to one-time items that are not indicative of the property's recurring operating performance.\n(b)\nTo calculate Same Store rental expense, we include an allocation of the property management expenses for our consolidated properties based on the property management fee that is provided for in the individual management agreements under which our wholly owned management companies provide property management services (generally the fee is based on a percentage of revenue). On consolidation, the management fee income and expenses are eliminated and the actual cost of providing property management services is recognized.\n(c)\nPrologis share of Same Store is calculated using the underlying building information from the Same Store NOI and NOI - Cash calculations and applying our ownership percentage as of December 31, 2017 to the NOI of each building for both periods.\n(d)\nIn order to derive Same Store- NOI - Cash, we adjust Same Store- NOI to exclude non-cash items included in our rental income in our financial statements, including straight line rent adjustments and adjustments related to purchase accounting to reflect leases at fair value at the time of acquisition.\nWeighted Average Stabilized Capitalization (\"Cap\") Rate is calculated as Stabilized NOI divided by the Acquisition Cost.\nView original content with multimedia: http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/prologis-reports-fourth-quarter-and-full-year-2017-earnings-results-300586445.html\nSOURCE Prologis, Inc.", "external_links": ["http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/prologis-reports-fourth-quarter-and-full-year-2017-earnings-results-300586445.html", "http://ir.prologis.com/"], "published": "2018-01-23T16:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-23T18:22:56.010+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
