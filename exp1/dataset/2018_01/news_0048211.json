We want to come up with our own set of regulations,” Aquino told a news conference. “You have to be extra careful how investors in this new space are protected.”\nAuthorities around the world, particularly in Asia, have attempted to rein in the global boom in trading bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies - a form of digital money created and maintained by its users.\nChinese authorities have banned initial coin offerings and shut down local trading platforms, while South Korea - where speculation on cryptocurrencies is also rife - is working on plans to ban virtual coin exchanges.\nThe regulation on ICOs will include guidelines on cybersecurity of cryptocurrency markets, eligibility of issuers including the officials and technology utilized, and financial literacy of investors, Aquino said.\nThe corporate regulator has yet to approve any public sale of cryptocurrencies and is investigating unlicensed sellers.\n“Unfortunately, there have been a lot of cases where ICO promoters vanish into thin air. We don’t want that to happen here,” Aquino said.\nHackers last week stole $530 million worth of digital money from Tokyo-based cryptocurrency exchange Coincheck Inc in one of the biggest-ever thefts of digital money.\nReporting by Neil Jerome Morales; Editing by Sam Holmes\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-29T09:37:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-29T09:51:50.001+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
