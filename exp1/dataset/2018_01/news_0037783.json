The country has the world’s largest proven oil reserves but suffers inflation and food shortages.\nFor a list of the officials sanctioned on Monday, please go to: here .pdf%23page\nWriting by Gabriela Baczynska, Editing by William Maclean\n ", "external_links": ["http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=OJ%3aL%3a2018%3a016I%3aFULL&from=EN", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-01-22T20:35:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-23T18:05:27.024+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
