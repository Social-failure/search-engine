AT&T declined to comment.\nThe Mate 10 Pro, launched in Europe in October with a price tag of 799 euros ($955), comes with AI-enhanced chips that Huawei, the world's third largest smartphone vendor, says process data faster than those used by Apple and Samsung.\nBut the collapse of the deal with AT&T, first reported by the Wall Street Journal, will mean that Huawei will likely struggle to make a hit of its smartphones there as a U.S. mobile carrier would typically promote the products as well as provide subsidies and special package deals.\nIn 2012, Huawei and ZTE Corp were the subject of a U.S. investigation that looked into whether the companies' equipment provided an opportunity for greater foreign espionage and threatened critical U.S. infrastructure - a link that Huawei has consistently denied.
