Critics said the policy would have the opposite effect. \nAn EPA official did not immediately respond to a request for comment. \nThe advisory boards provide the scientific input for agency decisions around pollution and climate change regulation and were created by Congress to serve as a check on EPA policies and research. \nIn its complaint, the Union of Concerned Scientists called the decision a “purge”, and “an attack on science itself.” \n“It portrays legitimate, independent scientists — who provide accurate, evidence-based information backed by verifiable, peer-reviewed research... - as just another interest group,” it said. \nIt said the EPA’s memorandum on the decision did not prove that receiving EPA grants causes bias, or explain why the decision did not also bar scientists that are affiliated with private industry or local governments. \n“The effect is that private industry views will be overweighted,” on the panels, it said. \nThe complaint asks that the court to prevent the EPA from implementing the policy. \nDuring his election campaign last year, Trump promised to roll back environmental regulations, including those limiting carbon dioxide emissions blamed for global warming, to make government more friendly to the drilling, mining, and manufacturing businesses. \nPruitt, who had sued the EPA repeatedly while Oklahoma’s attorney general, was among Trump’s most controversial nominees. He is an outspoken doubter of mainstream climate science that concludes carbon dioxide from human use of fossil fuels is a primary driver of global warming, triggering more frequent volatile storms, sea level rise and droughts.
