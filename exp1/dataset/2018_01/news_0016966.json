Supply from local soybean crop was also good,” said Sandeep Bajoria, chief executive of vegetable oil importer Sunvin group.\nIndia, the world’s biggest edible oil buyer, in November doubled the import tax on crude palm oil to 30 percent, while the duty on refined palm oil was raised to 40 percent from 25 percent.\nSoybean crushing has picked up after the duty hike, dealers said.\nThe country’s palm oil imports in December were 722,857 tonnes, slightly down from 723,158 tonnes a year ago, the SEA data showed.\nIndia’s palm oil and soyoil imports in January could rise to 775,000 tonnes and 190,000 tonnes respectively, Bajoria said.\nIndia primarily imports palm oil from Indonesia and Malaysia and soyoil from Argentina and Brazil. It also buys small volumes of sunflower oil from Ukraine and canola oil from Canada.\nReporting by Rajendra Jadhav; editing by Richard Pullin\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-12T09:03:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-12T09:34:30.001+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
