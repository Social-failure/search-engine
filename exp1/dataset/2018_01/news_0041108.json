REUTERS/Stefano Rellandini \nFour-times overall World Cup winner Vonn shook her head in frustration after her run. \nBut her second place in Friday’s downhill and her win on Saturday showed that the 33-year-old, who missed Sochi through injury, will still be a gold medal contender in Pyeongchang next month. \n“An unlucky day...never had such a strong wind gust in a race ever in my life. Oh well, can’t change it. I’ll save the good luck for February I guess,” said Vonn on Twitter. \n“Also tough race considering most of the athletes are still qualifying for the Olympics and wind is dictating results.” \nShiffrin remained runaway leader of the overall World Cup standings with 1477 points, a huge 876 clear of Tina Weirather. Gut’s win took her top of the Super G standings.
