Included in the $(277,000) loss is a one-time write-down of $880,000 of deferred tax assets due to the reduction in corporate tax rates for 2018. For the year ended December 31, 2017, NCB reported net income of $1,971,000, or $6.83 per share, compared to $4,685,000, or $16.27 per share for the year ended December 31, 2016. NCB continues to improve asset quality which resulted in a reversal of loan provision expense in the amount of $1,264,000 for the twelve months of 2017 compared to a $3,662,000 provision reversal for the same period in 2016. Non-performing loans to total loans have decreased from 1.95% to 0.20% over the last year.\nTotal assets increased year-over-year to $429,752,000 at December 31, 2017 compared to $412,162,000 at December 31, 2016. Total loans of $271,037,000 at December 31, 2017 increased 29.8% from $208,724,000 the year before as the Bank continued to build and expand its commercial and commercial real estate lending programs. Of this growth, $16,900,000 occurred during the fourth quarter. Total deposits grew to $380,651,000 at December 31, 2017, a 5.1% increase over $362,170,000 the year before with $16,985,000 gathered in the fourth quarter. The Bank's net interest margin increased to 3.26% at December 31, 2017 up from 2.87% a year ago as a result of the improvements in credit quality, loan growth and a change in the mix of the loan portfolio.\nTotal shareholders' equity increased to $43,628,000 at December 31, 2017 from $40,985,000 a year ago. For the year ended December 31, 2017 the return on average assets and return on average equity was 0.47% and 4.51%, respectively.\nRichard B. (Randy) Anderson, Jr. President and Chief Executive Officer said, \"Adjusting for the impact of the one-time deferred tax asset write-down, as well as the loan loss provision reversals and gains on sale of securities, we are excited about the continued progress made during 2017 to improve the core earnings potential of the Bank and position it for greater profitability in 2018. Net interest income has improved significantly and the lending, business development and support staff are now in place to continue this momentum without any significant additions.\"\nThe National Capital Bank of Washington was founded in 1889 and is Washington's Oldest Bank.
