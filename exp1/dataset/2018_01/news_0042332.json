ORIGINAL DRAMA \nDarroch said the company’s investment in original programming, such as dramas “Riviera” and “Tin Star”, drove viewing figures for Sky’s own channels up 6 percent. \n“We have an exceptional line-up of acquired series, and when you add to that our own Sky Originals, it puts us in what I think is the strongest content position we’ve ever had,” he told reporters on Thursday. \nThe results come two days after Britain’s competition regulatory ruled that Fox’s bid to buy the 61 percent of Sky it does not already own was not in the public interest. \nMurdoch, who also owns newspapers in Britain, now has to come up with an arrangement that will prevent him from influencing the news agenda at Sky, for instance by spinning off its Sky News channel. \nDarroch said Sky, along with Fox, was focused on this media ownership hurdle after the competition regulator dismissed concerns about Murdoch’s commitment to broadcasting standards. \n“We are very much focused in the process with the (regulator) CMA,” he told reporters. \n“We have (media) plurality as the final issue to work though,(...) and we’ll see where that takes us.” \nHe would not comment on the company’s thinking about Sky News, saying any messages about the 24-hour service would be given directly to staff. \n“We have got a day job to do,” he said. “And I think you can see from results and the plan we are laying out for 2018 we are not being distracted from any of that.” \nBefore the government gives its final decision on the Fox deal in June, Sky faces the next auction for English Premier League rights, the cornerstone of its offer to soccer fans. \nSome of the pressure on Sky to pay huge sums to retain the biggest packages of games has been eased by a deal it struck with its biggest rival BT to supply channels on each other’s platform. \nDarroch said he wouldn’t give a running commentary on the auction, adding Sky’s bid strategy was commercially sensitive. $1 = 0.7019 pounds Editing by James Davey and Mark Potter", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-01-25T15:36:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-25T10:14:32.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
