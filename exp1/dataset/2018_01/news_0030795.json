Slideshow (10 Images) WEAKENED BOURNEMOUTH \nWigan, who won the competition five years ago but have since slipped down the divisions, overcame a weakened Bournemouth side with a first-half effort from Sam Morsy and quick-fire second-half goals from Dan Burn and Callum Elder. \nBournemouth made eight changes to the side that had beaten Arsenal on Sunday, clearly signalling where the FA Cup lies in their priorities as they battle to steer clear of the Premier League relegation zone. \nMorsy swept home after Will Grigg’s initial effort was saved, substitute Burn volleyed in from Max Power’s cross and Elder headed in at the far post to complete a superb victory for the lower league side. \nJordan Ayew gave Swansea the lead after 11 minutes with a superb goal reminiscent of Ricky Villa’s famous Cup final replay winner for Tottenham Hotspur against Manchester City in 1981. \nWolves, however, equalised after 66 minutes through Diogo Jota only for Bony to poke in at the other end three minutes later after the visitors failed to deal with Tom Carroll’s cross.
