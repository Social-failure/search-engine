Because of the severity of the infringement, the European Commission opted to fine Qualcomm 4.9% of its 2017 revenues.\n“Qualcomm illegally shut out rivals from the market for LTE baseband chipsets for over five years, thereby cementing its market dominance,” said Margrethe Vestager, the Commission’s competition chief. “These payments were not just reductions in price--they were made on the condition that Apple would exclusively use Qualcomm’s baseband chipsets in all its iPhones and iPads.”\n“This meant that no rival could effectively challenge Qualcomm in this market, no matter how good their products were. Qualcomm’s behaviour denied consumers and other companies more choice and innovation--and this in a sector with a huge demand and potential for innovative technologies. This is illegal under EU antitrust rules and why we have taken today’s decision.”\nQualcomm, which stressed that the decision had no effect on its ongoing operations, said it would appeal.\n“We are confident this agreement did not violate EU competition rules or adversely affect market competition or European consumers,” said Don Rosenberg, the company’s executive vice president and general counsel. “We have a strong case for judicial review and we will immediately commence that process.”\nRead: Chip Wars 2018: What Intel, Nvidia, AMD and Qualcomm Announced at CES \nThe agreement between Apple aapl and Qualcomm qcom began in 2011 and was renewed in 2013. It ran until the end of 2016.\nThe Commission examined internal Apple documents that showed the payments steered the company away from sourcing part of its baseband chipset requirements from Intel. A few months before the agreement expired, once the Commission had started probing the arrangement, Apple went ahead and did just that.\nIronically, Intel was itself fined $1.3 billion by the Commission’s antitrust directorate in 2009--a record at the time--for paying PC manufacturers to exclusively use its processors.\nSouth Korea’s antitrust regulator fined Qualcomm $854 million in late 2016 for unfair business practices in its patent licensing and modem chip sales.\nFortune has asked Apple and Intel for reaction to Wednesday’s fine, but has received none at the time of writing.\nThis article was updated to include Qualcomm’s statement, and to note that Apple started sourcing Intel parts shortly before its Qualcomm agreement expired.
