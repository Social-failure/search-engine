Islamic State claimed responsibility for the attack near the Marshal Fahim military academy on the city’s western outskirts.\nThe attacks have put pressure on President Ashraf Ghani and his U.S. allies, who have expressed growing confidence that a new, more aggressive military strategy has succeeded in driving Taliban insurgents back from major provincial centers.\nPAKISTAN ROLE Ties between the United States and Pakistan are already brittle after Washington announced plans earlier in January to suspend up to roughly $2 billion in U.S. security assistance. U.S. President Donald Trump tweeted that Pakistan had rewarded past U.S. aid with “nothing but lies & deceit.”\nPakistan, which denies the accusations it allows safe havens for militants, condemned Saturday’s attack and accused Washington of betrayal.\nAs tensions rise, the United States has been quietly examining ways to mitigate any retaliation by Pakistan, a crucial gateway for U.S. military supplies destined for troops fighting the 16-year-old war in landlocked Afghanistan.\nIt also has not ruled out additional steps, including unilateral strikes in Pakistan against Haqqani targets.\nSaikal renewed the longstanding Afghan concern that the plots for these attacks were coming from Pakistan and cheered Trump’s rejection on Monday of the possibility of peace talks with the Taliban.\n“We hope the fight also includes focus on where the terrorist attacks are plotted and organized,” he said in an interview.\nReporting by Phil Stewart and Idrees Ali; Editing by Peter Cooney and Tom Brown\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-01-30T04:38:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-30T03:24:02.002+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
