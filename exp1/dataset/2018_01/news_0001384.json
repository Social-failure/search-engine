REUTERS/Mike Blake/File photo \nThe 22-year-old Alpine ski racer heads to her second Olympic Games oozing with confidence after notching 37 World Cup wins, including the first ever in downhill late last year which stunned the skiing world. \nHer torrid pace at World Cup events puts her on track to top Swedish legend Ingemar Stenmark’s all-time record of 86 wins. \nBut the slalom specialist will soon be ready to shift her focus from racking up World Cup wins to claiming medals on the sport’s biggest stage. \nIn a statement that should strike fear into the hearts of her competitors, she told Reuters that she was a better skiier now than she was when the then 18-year-old from Colorado won gold in slalom in Sochi, becoming the youngest women’s slalom champion in Olympic history. \n“Being four years older I feel like I have more experience and knowledge under my belt,” she said. \n“But especially since I have improved my skiing a lot since Sochi and I have had more success in events other than slalom, I feel like I‘m going into Pyeongchang with the unique opportunity to be a multiple event medal threat, which is super cool.” \nDespite her success in downhill, where she earned her maiden World Cup victory in the discipline at Canada’s Lake Louise in early December, she is resisting the urge to stretch herself too thin in South Korea.
