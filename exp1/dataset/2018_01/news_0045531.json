Look at the car today - it’s 80 pct different,” Guajardo said. \nHe said negotiators needed to listen to what Trump had promised to achieve in NAFTA reform, and try to interpret that in a way that did as little damage as possible, with a scope and time frame that was manageable for business. \n“The president is right in saying that in North America, we have to make a much better effort to integrate value production in the North American countries,” he said. \nAnother complex negotiating issue is dispute settlement, he said. \nAsked what could kill NAFTA, Freeland said there was a clause in the agreement that allowed any member to withdraw, after giving six months’ notice, and so a political decision could allow any of the three to leave. \n“It will not kill NAFTA,” Guajardo said. \n“That is what I was about to say,” Freeland added. She urged business leaders at Davos to make their voices heard if they wanted a NAFTA deal. \nThe Davos panel where Guajardo and Freeland were speaking did not include a U.S. government representative.
