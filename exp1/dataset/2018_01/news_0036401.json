Republicans approved tax cuts in December that will add about $1.5 trillion to the debt over 10 years. \nAfter a dramatic standoff with Democrats over immigration policy, Congress approved the stopgap bill to fund the federal government until Feb. 8. President Donald Trump signed it into law late Monday, ending a three-day government shutdown.
