Russia’s central election commission declined to register Navalny as a candidate in the election, citing what Navalny said was a trumped up criminal conviction. \nThursday’s police search took place on the same day as President Vladimir Putin, who polls show is on track to be comfortably re-elected, was visiting St Petersburg.
