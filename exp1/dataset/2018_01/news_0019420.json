REUTERS/Youssef Boudlal “This is what the government has done to us,” said one a protester named Fouad. “Pockets are empty by unfair decisions of the government...I am a professor and my wife is a teacher, but we are suffering today to meet what we need.”\n“We have only won the freedom of expression after 2011 revolution ... but we will remain in the streets until we win our economic rights just as we have our freedom”, he added.\nSlideshow (3 Images) Police seeking to separate supporters of the opposition Popular Front party and the Islamist Ennahda party, which is part of the ruling coalition. The government and Ennahda accuse the PF of being behind some of the violence last week.\nPrices have increased for fuel and some consumer goods, while taxes on cars, phone calls, the internet, hotel accommodation and other items have also gone up.\nTunisia has been hailed as the only democratic success of the Arab Spring: the one Arab country to topple a long-serving leader in that year’s uprisings without triggering widespread violence or civil war.\nBut Tunisia has had nine governments since Ben Ali’s overthrow, none of which have been able to resolve deep-rooted economic problems. The economy worsened since a vital tourism sector was nearly wiped out by a wave of deadly militant attacks in 2015, and has yet to recover despite improved security.\nEditing by Ulf Laessing and Raissa Kasolowsky\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-14T15:04:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-14T15:26:15.015+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
