If adopted, these adjustments could have a positive yet insignificant impact on our final risk-based capital computations. Community Trust Bancorp, Inc. anticipates electing to early adopt effective December 31, 2017 should the proposed guidance be issued.\nCommunity Trust Bancorp, Inc. (NASDAQ:CTBI) reports record earnings for the fourth quarter 2017 of $14.9 million, or $0.84 per basic share, compared to $13.8 million, or $0.78 per basic share, earned during the third quarter 2017 and $11.9 million, or $0.67 per basic share, earned during the fourth quarter 2016. Earnings for the year ended December 31, 2017 were a record $51.5 million, or $2.92 per basic share, compared to $47.3 million, or $2.70 per basic share, for the year ended December 31, 2016.\nThe December 22, 2017 enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 resulted in an immediate recognition of a tax benefit of $2.8 million as CTBI is in a net deferred tax liability position. The impact to earnings per share was $0.16 per share for the quarter and year ended December 31, 2017. As a result of the positive impact on income tax expense during the period, CTBI announced a one-time bonus for all non-executive employees of $1,000 per full-time employee and $500 per part-time employee. The $0.7 million after-tax impact to earnings per share resulting from this accrual was $0.04 per share for the quarter and year ended December 31, 2017. The net impact to earnings per share from these two events, therefore, was an increase of $0.12 per share.\n4 th Quarter 2017 Highlights\nNet interest income for the quarter of $35.1 million was an increase of $0.1 million, or 0.4%, from third quarter 2017 and $1.7 million, or 5.1%, from prior year fourth quarter. Provision for loan losses for the quarter ended December 31, 2017 increased $2.2 million from prior quarter and $0.8 million from prior year same quarter. Our loan portfolio increased $9.5 million, an annualized 1.2%, during the quarter and $184.6 million, or 6.3%, from December 31, 2016. Net loan charge-offs for the quarter ended December 31, 2017 were $3.1 million, or 0.39% of average loans annualized, compared to $1.4 million, or 0.18%, experienced for the third quarter 2017 and $1.9 million, or 0.26%, for the fourth quarter 2016. Nonperforming loans at $28.3 million decreased $1.7 million from September 30, 2017 but increased $0.8 million from December 31, 2016. Nonperforming assets at $60.4 million decreased $1.8 million from September 30, 2017 and $3.0 million from December 31, 2016. Deposits, including repurchase agreements, increased $47.3 million during the quarter and $175.3 million from December 31, 2016. Noninterest income for the quarter ended December 31, 2017 of $12.4 million was an increase of $0.2 million, or 1.8%, from prior quarter but a decrease of $0.1 million, or 0.8%, from prior year same quarter. The variance in noninterest income was primarily due to fluctuations in the valuation of our mortgage servicing rights. Noninterest expense for the quarter ended December 31, 2017 of $27.7 million increased $0.8 million, or 3.0%, from prior quarter, and $0.7 million, or 2.7%, from prior year same quarter. The variance in noninterest expense for the quarter was due to the one-time bonus discussed above, which resulted in an increase in personnel expense. The increase in personnel expense was partially offset by a decrease in net other real estate owned expense.\nNet Interest Income\nNet interest income for the quarter of $35.1 million was an increase of $0.1 million, or 0.4%, from third quarter 2017 and $1.7 million, or 5.1%, from prior year fourth quarter. Our net interest margin at 3.65% was down two basis points from prior quarter and one basis point from prior year same quarter, while our average earning assets increased $31.0 million and $178.6 million, respectively, during those same periods. Our yield on average earning assets increased 5 basis points from prior quarter and 18 basis points from prior year same quarter, and our cost of funds increased 10 basis points from prior quarter and 26 basis points from prior year same quarter. Our ratio of average loans to deposits, including repurchase agreements, was 89.1% for the quarter ended December 31, 2017 compared to 91.1% for the quarter ended September 30, 2017 and 87.9% for the quarter ended December 31, 2016.

The increase from prior quarter consisted of a $0.3 million increase in loan related fees, as a result of fluctuations in the valuation of our mortgage servicing rights, and a $0.1 million increase in trust revenue. These increases were partially offset by a $0.1 million decrease in net gains on other real estate owned. The decrease from prior year same quarter consisted of a $0.4 million decrease in loan related fees, partially offset by a $0.2 million increase in trust revenue. Noninterest income for the year ended December 31, 2017 of $48.5 million was a $0.1 million, or 0.1% increase, from the year ended December 31, 2016.\nNoninterest Expense\nNoninterest expense for the quarter ended December 31, 2017 of $27.7 million increased $0.8 million, or 3.0%, from prior quarter, and $0.7 million, or 2.7%, from prior year same quarter. The increase in noninterest expense was due to increased personnel expense of $1.7 million from prior quarter and $1.4 million from prior year same quarter. Personnel expense increased $0.9 million due to a one-time bonus for all non-executive employees of $1,000 per full-time employee and $500 per part-time employee so that they may share in the benefit CTBI received from the recently enacted tax legislation. Personnel expense was also impacted by a $0.6 million increase in the cost of group medical and life insurance from prior quarter and a $0.3 million increase in salaries from prior year same quarter. The increase in personnel expense was partially offset by a decrease in net other real estate owned expense of $0.9 million from prior quarter and $0.5 million from prior year same quarter. Noninterest expense for the year ended December 31, 2017 increased $2.8 million, or 2.6%, compared to the year ended December 31, 2016, as a result of a $1.8 million increase in pe", "external_links": ["http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180117005819/en/"], "published": "2018-01-17T17:02:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-17T19:13:53.018+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
