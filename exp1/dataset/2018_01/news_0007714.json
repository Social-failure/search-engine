REUTERS/Valentyn Ogirenko \nUkraine said it would consider Georgia’s extradition request though legal procedures would have to be followed. \n“Prosecutors are in the process of arranging a date for Saakashvili’s questioning due to Georgia’s request to extradite him,” Andriy Lysenko, spokesman for the Ukrainian prosecutor general, told Reuters by phone in Kiev. \nThe 50-year-old Saakashvili, a mercurial figure, moved to Ukraine in 2014. \nHis support for Ukraine’s pro-Europe Maidan movement, which forced a Russian-backed president to flee the country, won him favor from incoming President Petro Poroshenko who appointed him governor of the Black Sea Odessa region. \nBut he has fallen out badly with his former patron in Ukraine after accusing him of corruption and is under suspicion of assisting a criminal organization, which he denies. \nHe attracts big crowds to rallies in Ukraine and there have been occasional violent clashes between his supporters and police in Kiev.
