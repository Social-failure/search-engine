The recent announcement of reduction in international termination rates will further accentuate this decline,\" Gopal Vittal, Bharti Airtel's managing director and chief executive for India and South Asia, said in a statement on Thursday. ( bit.ly/2rk5hJG ) \nRevenue from mobile services in India fell 22.2 percent to 107.51 billion rupees, while overall revenue dropped 13 percent to 203.19 billion rupees. \nBharti’s shares fell nearly one percent. They climbed 73.2 percent in 2017, helped by the company’s acquisition strategy and other measures to tackle competition. \n($1 = 63.8525 Indian rupees)", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-18T14:59:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-18T15:15:52.027+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
