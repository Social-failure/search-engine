REUTERS/Kim Kyung-Hoon \nAbe’s ruling bloc has a two-thirds “super majority” in both chambers - at least until an upper house election next year - but the outlook for a referendum remains murky. \nAbe has proposed an amendment that would retain Article 9’s first clause renouncing the right to go to war and a second clause banning a standing military while adding a specific reference to the “Self-Defense Forces” (SDF), as Japan calls its military. \nThose in favour of his proposal say it would just codify the status quo. Opponents argue it would make it easier for Japan’s military to take part in overseas conflicts. \nA Mainichi newspaper survey published on Monday showed 31 percent agreed with Abe’s proposal, while 12 percent supported a more drastic proposal that would delete the second clause while adding a reference to the SDF. \nTwenty-one percent opposed any change and 27 percent said they didn’t know. \nA public vote on the constitution could end up a referendum on Abe, whose support last year fell sharply due to suspected cronyism scandals. \nThe Mainichi poll put support for Abe at 44 percent, though only 37 percent want to see him win a third term as LDP leader in September, a win that would put him on track to become Japan’s longest serving premier. \nAll of which means Abe may decide not to rush and risk rejection. “Abe is flexible. He might aim for an amendment around 2020,” Harukata Takenaka, a professor at the National Graduate Institute for Policy Studies, told reporters recently.
