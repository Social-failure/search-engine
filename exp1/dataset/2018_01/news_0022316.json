Many U.K.-based firms are worried that they are going to lose access to those markets.\nOnce the U.K. leaves the European economic bloc in March 2019, \"we can offer a very good solution for companies who potentially may have a difficulty,\" D'Arcy continued. \"We are a pro-business country. We are non-protectionist.\"\nAside from a low corporate tax rate of 12.5 percent — well below the U.K.'s 19 percent and Hong Kong's 16.5 percent — Ireland boasts other advantages such as a flexible workforce and a robust financial services sector, D'Arcy said.\nThe United Kingdom , which includes Northern Ireland, voted in 2016 to leave the European Union, but the Republic of Ireland remains within the bloc.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-15T06:56:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-15T06:57:12.006+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
