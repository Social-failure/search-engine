( bit.ly/2D0YMkl ) \nAccording to the report, consultant Bain & Co was hired to help review IBM’s Global Technology Services unit. \nThe “projected headcount impact of 2018 actions” include 10,900 from the U.S. and 20,000 across the globe in IBM’s Client Innovation Centres, according to the report. \n“Many consultants recommend things to IBM, many of which remain merely recommendations,” IBM said. \nIBM, one of the world’s original PC producers but now a diversified technology company, beat expectations for revenue in its last quarterly results in October after 22 straight quarters of declines. \nShares of IBM were little changed.
