The survival of the cub or cubs will not be fully confirmed until March, when bears emerge after winter.\nThe polar bear breeding season began in March last year, during which time Victoria mated with Arktos, one of the park’s two males.\n“While we are absolutely thrilled, we are not celebrating prematurely as polar bear cubs have a high mortality rate in the first weeks of life due to their undeveloped immune system and the mother’s exaggerated need for privacy, with any disturbance risking the cub being killed or abandoned,” Richardson said.\nPolar bears are born about 30 cm long and weigh roughly the same as a guinea pig. They emerge blind and do not open their eyes until they are about a month old, depending entirely on their mother’s milk.\nReporting by Elisabeth O'Leary; editing by Stephen Addison\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-03T15:43:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-03T15:59:53.013+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
