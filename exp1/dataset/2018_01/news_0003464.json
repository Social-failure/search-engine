So if it’s better than that, then that’s positive. \n“But playing the matches and getting used to that intensity again and how you recover from a match is what is important. And I‘m hoping I‘m going to be okay, but you never know for sure until you go through it.” Reporting by Aditi Prakash in Bengaluru; Editing by Christian Radnedge", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-01T17:32:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-01T17:43:09.020+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
