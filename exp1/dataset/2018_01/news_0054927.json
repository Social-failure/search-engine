LOUIS, Jan. 31, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Energizer Holdings, Inc. (NYSE: ENR) today announced results for the first fiscal quarter, which ended December 31, 2017. For the first fiscal quarter, net earnings were $60.4 million, or $0.98 per diluted share, compared to $95.6 million, or $1.52 per diluted share, in the prior year first quarter. Adjusted net earnings in the first quarter were $95.5 million, or $1.55 per diluted share, compared to adjusted net earnings of $95.1 million, or $1.51 per diluted share, in the prior year first quarter.\n\"During the critical holiday season, we continued to deliver strong operating results with continued innovation, which included the introduction of our best performing Energizer Max ever,\" said Alan Hoskins, Chief Executive Officer. \"We also continue to drive productivity gains with progress on our continuous improvement efforts. We complemented these operating results by repurchasing 1.1 million shares during the quarter and announced an agreement to acquire Spectrum Brands Holdings' global battery and portable lighting business. As a result of our strong first quarter results and the impact of the new U.S. tax legislation, we are increasing our full year Fiscal 2018 adjusted earnings per share guidance to $3.30 to $3.40.\"\nFirst Quarter 2018 Financial Highlights (Unaudited)\nThe following is a summary of key first fiscal quarter results. All comparisons are with the first quarter of fiscal 2017 unless otherwise stated.\nNet sales were $573.3 million, an increase of 2.4%: (a) Organic net sales increased $5.9 million, or 1.1%, due to pricing favorability and benefits recognized from our portfolio optimization offset by retailer merchandising changes in the U.S., lapping of hurricane activity in the prior fiscal quarter and the May 2017 divestiture of the non-core promotional sales business acquired with the auto care acquisition. Favorable currency impacts were $7.8 million, or 1.3%. Gross Margin percentage was 48.5%, flat to prior year driven by improved pricing and the favorable impact of foreign currency. These items were primarily offset by less favorable overhead absorption versus the prior fiscal quarter and investments made in continuous improvement initiatives. A&P spending was 6.5% of net sales, an increase of 40 basis points, or $3.0 million, versus the prior year, primarily in support of portfolio initiatives and holiday programs. SG&A spending, excluding acquisition and integration costs, was $93.5 million, an increase of $9.9 million over the prior year due to our current year investments in our continuous improvement initiatives. SG&A, excluding acquisition and integration costs, was 16.3% of net sales compared to 14.9% in the prior year. (a) (b) Earnings before income tax was favorably impacted by the movement in foreign currencies by approximately $3 million, net of hedge impact, in the first fiscal quarter. Income tax rate on a year to date basis was 49.2% as compared to 28.7% in the prior year. The current year rate includes a $31 million charge for the one-time impact of the new U.S. tax legislation passed in December 2017. Excluding the impact of our Non-GAAP adjustments, the year to date tax rate was 23.4% as compared to 28.8% in the prior year. The decrease in the rate is driven by the U.S. tax legislation and takes into account the new statutory U.S. rate that is now effective for fiscal year 2018. (a) Diluted earnings per share for the quarter was $0.98 and Adjusted diluted earnings per share for the quarter was $1.55. Net cash from operating activities on a year to date basis was $141.0 million and Free Cash Flow on a year to date basis was $135.5 million, or 23.6% of net sales. (a) Dividend payments in the quarter were approximately $17.6 million, or $0.29 per share. Repurchased approximately 1,126,000 shares of common stock for $50.0 million.\n(a) See Press Release attachments for additional information as well as the GAAP to Non-GAAP reconciliations.\n(b) The first quarter 2018 adoption of ASU 2017-07, Improving the Presentation of Net Periodic Pension Cost and Net Periodic Postretirement Benefit Costs (ASU 2017-07) requires pension financing costs to be recorded in Other items, net. The 2017 quarter reflects this reclassification which caused a net pension benefit of $3.1 million to be reclassified out of SG&A.\nTotal Net Sales (In millions - Unaudited)\nFor the Quarter Ended December 31, 2017\nQ1\n% Chg\nNet Sales - FY'17\n$\n559.6\nOrganic\n5.9\n1.1\n%\nImpact of currency\n7.8\n1.3\n%\nNet sales - FY'18\n$\n573.3\n2.4\n%\nTotal net sales increased 2.4%, or 13.7 million:\nOrganic net sales were up 1.1%, or $5.9 million, in the first fiscal quarter due to the following items: Favorable pricing across several markets increased net sales by 3%; Investments made for our portfolio realignment in the back half of fiscal 2017 benefited our top-line in the first fiscal quarter of 2018 accounting for 0.5% of the organic sales increase; and Offsetting the above increases in organic net sales were retailer merchandising changes in the U.S. that negatively impacted net sales by 1.3%, lapping of storm volume from prior year of 0.6% and the May 2017 divestiture of the non-core promotional sales business acquired with the auto care acquisition that negatively impacted net sales by 0.5%. Favorable currency impacts were 7.8 million, or 1.3%.\nTotal Segment Profit (In millions - Unaudited)\nFor the Quarter Ended December 31, 2017\nQ1\n% Chg\nSegment Profit - FY'17\n$\n173.9\nOrganic\n(6.5)\n(3.7)\n%\nImpact of currency\n4.9\n2.8\n%\nSegment Profit - FY'18\n$\n172.3\n(0.9)\n%\nTotal Segment Profit in the first fiscal quarter decreased $1.6 million, or 0.9%. Excluding the favorable movement in foreign currencies of $4.9 million, organic segment profit decreased $6.5 million, or 3.7%, in the current fiscal quarter. Top-line growth in the quarter was more than offset by increases in SG&A and A&P due to our continuous improvement initiatives and A&P spending related to our portfolio optimization and holiday programs.\nRefer to the Reconciliation of GAAP and Non-GAAP Financial Measures attached for further information on our above breakouts.\nFinancial Outlook for Fiscal Year 2018\nThe company has increased its previously communicated adjusted EPS outlook for the full fiscal year to $3.30 to $3.40. This updated range takes into account the impact related to the new U.S. tax legislation passed in December as well as the positive first quarter operating performance. The Company is providing the updated assumptions below related to its financial outlook for the fiscal year 2018.\nNote that all comparisons are with the fiscal year ended September 30, 2017 unless otherwise stated. The outlook provided below takes into account our lapping of significant hurricane activity in fiscal 2017 that contributed approximately $26 million of net sales and $0.08 to adjusted earnings per share. Our outlook assumes that activity is not expected to repeat.\nNet Sales on a reported basis are expected to be up low single digits:\nOrganic net sales are expected to be up low single digits, including lapping the impact of hurricane activity of approximately $26 million and lapping distribution gains in fiscal 2017; Favorable movements in foreign currency are expected to benefit net sales by 1.0% to 1.5% based on current rates.\nGross margin rates are now expected to be up 50 basis points versus the prior year, excluding fiscal 2017 acquisition and integration costs, driven primarily by improved productivity despite rising commodities and the costs of continuous improvement associated with optimizing our footprint.\nA&P spending is expected to be in the range of 6% to 7% of net sales, consistent with our long term outlook.\nSG&A as a percent of net sales is expected to be flat on a year over year basis excluding acquisition and integration costs. (a)\nEarnings before income taxes is expected to be favorably impacted by the movement of foreign currencies by roughly $5 to $10 million, net of hedge impacts, based on current rates.\nEx-unusual tax rate is now expected to be in the range of 23% to 25% taking into account the impact related to the new U.S. tax legislation passed in December and our current expected country mix of earnings.\nAdjusted Diluted earnings per share for the full fiscal year is now expected to be in the range of $3.30 to $3.40, inclusive of the new U.S. tax legislation passed in December.\nCapital spending is expected to be in the range of $30 to $35 million.\nFree cash flow is now expected to be in the range of $240 to $250 million, which includes the impact of fiscal year 2018 U.S. tax legislation passed in December.\n(a) SG&A guidance takes into account the adoption of ASU 2017-07 which requires pension financing costs to be recorded in Other items, net. The 2018 guidance reflects the fiscal year 2017 reclassification which resulted in a net pension benefit of $3.1 million reclassified out of SG&A to Other items, net, and a resulting increase in SG&A as a percent of net sales from 19.7% to 20.4% for fiscal year 2017.\nWebcast Information\nIn conjunction with this announcement, the Company will hold an investor conference call beginning at 10:00 a.m. eastern time today.

However, management believes that certain non-GAAP financial measures provide users with additional meaningful comparisons to the corresponding historical or future period. These non-GAAP financial measures exclude items that are not reflective of the Company's on-going operating performance, such as acquisition and integration costs, costs related to spin and the one-time impact of the new U.S. tax legislation. In addition, these measures help investors to analyze year over year comparability when excluding currency fluctuations, acquisition activity as well as other company initiatives that are not on-going. We believe these non-GAAP financial measures are an enhancement to assist investors in understanding our business and in performing analysis consistent with financial models developed by research analysts. Investors should consider non-GAAP measures in addition to, not as a substitute for, or superior to, the comparable GAAP measures. In addition, these non-GAAP measures may not be the same as similar measures used by other companies due to possible differences in method and in the items being adjusted.\nWe provide the following non-GAAP measures and calculations, as well as the corresponding reconciliation to the closest GAAP measure in the following supplemental schedules:\nSegment Profit. This amount represents the operations of our three geographic segments including allocations for shared support functions. General corporate and other expenses, Global marketing expenses, R&D expenses, amortization expense, interest expense, other items, net, charges related to acquisition and integration and the spin-off have all been excluded from segment profit.\nAdjusted Earnings Before Income Taxes, Adjusted Net Earnings and Adjusted Diluted EPS . These measures exclude the impact of costs related to acquisition and integration, the spin-off and the one-time impact of the new U.S. tax legislation.\nEx-unusual Tax Rate . This is the tax rate when excluding the pre-tax impact of acquisition and integration and spin-off costs, as well as the related tax impact for these items, calculated utilizing the statutory rate for where the costs were incurred, as well as the one-time impact of the new U.S. tax legislation.\nOrganic. This is the non-GAAP financial measurement of the change in revenue, segment profit or other margins that excludes or otherwise adjusts for the impact of acquisitions and the impact of currency from the changes in foreign currency exchange rates as defined below:\nImpact of acquisitions. The Company acquired an auto care business on July 1, 2016. This includes the impact of the auto care on-going operations contributed to each respective income statement caption. This does not include the impact of acquisition and integration costs associated with the auto care acquisition.\nImpact of currency . The Company evaluates the operating performance of our Company on a currency neutral basis. The impact of currency is the difference between the value of current year foreign operations at the current period ending USD exchange rate, compared to the value of the current year foreign operations at the prior period ending USD exchange rate.\nAdjusted Comparisons. Detail for adjusted SG&A as a percent of sales are also supplemental non-GAAP measure disclosures. These measures exclude the impact of costs related acquisition and integration.\nFree Cash Flow. Free Cash Flow is defined as net cash provided by operating activities reduced by capital expenditures, net of the proceeds from asset sales. Given our extensive international operations, a significant portion of our cash is generated outside of the U.S. The repatriation of cash balances from certain of our subsidiaries could have adverse tax consequences or be subject to regulatory capital requirements.\nEnergizer Holdings, Inc.\nSupplemental Schedules - Segment Information and Supplemental Sales Data\nFor the Quarter Ended December 31, 2017\n(In millions, except per share data - Unaudited)\nOperations for Energizer are managed via three major geographic reportable segments: Americas (North America and Latin America), Europe, Middle East and Africa (\"EMEA\"), and Asia Pacific.\nEnergizer's operating model includes a combination of standalone and shared business functions between the geographic segments, varying by country and region of the world. Energizer applies a fully allocated cost basis, in which shared business functions are allocated between segments.
