Shareholders of record will receive two 2017 1099-DIVs—one 1099-DIV relating to the Special Distribution paid on January 23, 2018 and an additional 1099-DIV relating to the quarterly dividends paid in 2017 prior to the Special Distribution. \"Street name\" shareholders should expect to receive their 1099-DIVs from their bank, brokerage firm, or other nominee. The amounts indicated on the 2017 1099-DIVs should be reported on shareholders' 2017 federal income tax returns.\nPlease note that a substantial portion of the January 23, 2018 Special Distribution is included in the tax allocations for 2017 and is therefore taxable for the 2017 tax year. Approximately 5.3% of the Special Distribution relates to the 2018 tax year. The final tax allocations for 2018 distributions will be provided in January 2019.\nInvestors are encouraged to seek legal and/or tax professional advice about the specific tax treatment of distributions paid by the Company for the 2017 and 2018 tax years.\nABOUT ALEXANDER & BALDWIN\nAlexander & Baldwin is Hawaii's premier commercial real estate company and the state's largest owner of grocery/drug-anchored retail centers.
