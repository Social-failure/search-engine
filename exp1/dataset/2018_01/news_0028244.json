Slideshow (3 Images) \nThe 70-metre long work, the precise origins of which are obscure and which has not left France in its nearly 950-year known history, is currently on display in the town of Bayeux, in the northwestern French region of Normandy. \nMacron told reporters that the France and Britain were now fighting wars together, a reference to cooperation between the two former European adversaries against armed Islamist movements including in countries Mali. \n“We are in a way making a new tapestry together,” he said. \nA French official said on Wednesday the loan would not take place immediately because work needed to be done on the tapestry to ensure it was safe to move it.
