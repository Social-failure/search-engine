Petrobras said the settlement was not an admission of guilt and denied any wrongdoing.\n“The voluntary act of Petrobras paying $3 billion to foreign shareholders indicates it should pay proportional values to Brazilian shareholders,” Andre de Almeida, a lawyer leading the shareholder lawsuit in Brazil, told Reuters.\n“After all, the same facts, the same defendants, should have the same consequence, independent of the jurisdiction of the investment.”\nPetrobras declined to comment.\nWednesday’s settlement agreement, which must still be approved by a U.S. court, was one of the largest ever class action settlements in the United States.\nFor the last four years Brazil has been rocked by the so-called Car Wash investigation into kickbacks from contractors to executives of state-run companies and politicians in return for public projects.\nReporting by Marta Nogueira; Writing by Jake Spring, Editing by Rosalba O'Brien\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-05T00:09:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-05T00:21:45.039+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
