DEFICIT DOWN \nWhen the Conservative Party took power in 2010, Britain’s budget gap stood at 10 percent of economic output, about four times its current size. \nWhile Britain may do better than expected in cutting the deficit this financial year, the future remains challenging. \nThe OBR has pencilled in nearly 30 billion pounds in extra borrowing over the next four years, adding to the challenge for Hammond who has said he wants to wipe out the budget deficit altogether by the mid-2020s. \nThis year’s better finances largely reflect a bigger tax take. Value-added tax receipts in December were the highest on record, up by 4.9 percent to 12.3 billion pounds. \nIncome and capital gains tax revenues were up nearly 4 percent in the first nine months of the financial year, reflecting continued strong job creation over the period. \nCorporation tax revenues recovered from recent weakness to show a rise of nearly 3 percent in the financial year to date.
