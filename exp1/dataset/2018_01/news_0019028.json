Of the more than 3,200 cases reported in total, more than 3,000 have been in Lusaka.\nAll government and private schools will re-open on Jan. 22, but Zambiaâ€™s two largest public universities will remain closed for now.\nPresident Edgar Lungu last month directed the military to clean markets and unblock drains to help to fight the spread of the waterborne disease.\nCholera causes acute watery diarrhea. It can be treated with oral hydration solutions and antibiotics but spreads rapidly and can kill within hours if not treated.\nReporting by Chris Mfula; Editing by Kevin Liffey\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-14T17:10:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-14T17:23:52.032+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
