I think they are all of a theme, which there is just a new expectation of accountability. Business leaders are under more pressure than ever to justify the investments they make, the expenses they authorize on behalf of clients.\"\n\"In the area of marketing, one of the most challenging parts of our job right now is validating that the spending that our clients are doing creates results that really matter for their business,\" he added.\nBloomberg | Getty Images John Seifert, chief executive officer of advertising agency Ogilvy \"We are going to all have to get much smarter. We live in a world of big data, we can track (marketing) performance better than ever before, we have the ability to attribute the communications, both content and media activity, in a far better way. But advertisers and marketers need to be able to see it in proof.\"\nIndeed, big ad spenders Procter and Gamble (P&G) and Diageo have talked about making their marketing more efficient during results briefings this week.\nJon Moeller, P&G's chief financial officer, talked of \"eliminating non-viewable ads,\" as well as being more precise with digital ad placement, in the company's second half results call Tuesday.\n\"We see further cost reduction opportunity through more private market placed deals with media companies and precision media buying, fueled by data and digital technology,\" he said.
