It has the highest average daily retail trades of any discount broker, a category that also includes Charles Schwab Corp ( SCHW.N ) and E*TRADE Financial Corp. ( ETFC.O )\nE*Trade is expected to report earnings on Thursday after U.S. markets close.\nReporting By Elizabeth Dilts; Editing by Meredith Mazzilli\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-01-24T02:58:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-24T08:35:34.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
