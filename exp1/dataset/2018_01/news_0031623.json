Ltd. (TSX:GQM | OTCQX:GQMNF) (\"Golden Queen\" or \"the Company\") today announces its operating results for December 2017, including total gold production of 2,939 ounces and revenue of US$4.1 m from its Soledad Mountain gold-silver mine (the \"Mine\") located south of Mojave, California. All amounts herein are in US dollars and reflect 100% of the operating results of Golden Queen Mining Company, LLC (\"GQM LLC\"), the Company's 50%-owned subsidiary that holds the Mine, unless otherwise stated.\nGolden Queen advised in its third quarter Form 10-Q that management was accelerating the East Pit development to seek to access higher-grade ore tons as soon as possible to compensate for the shortfall in the ore supplied and the lower than expected gold ore grades from the North-West and Main (Phase 1) Pits. Since November 2017, five benches have been mined out in the East Pit and the Company is pleased to report the following positive reconciliation between Ore Control (production) and Reserves:\nOre Control v.

In addition, the gold grade was 13% higher than estimated for a total of 1.6 times the expected gold ounces. The silver grade was 8% higher than estimated for a total of 1.5 times the predicted number of silver ounces.\nOn January 22 nd , the Company's drill program comprising up to 20 holes and approximately 20,000 feet of reverse circulation drilling at a projected cost of US$1.0 m will commence. This drilling is designed to increase confidence in the currently modelled ore grades and tonnage associated with the Golden Queen vein structure, to improve the Company's understanding of the Patience vein structure with the objective of adding additional ounces to the reserves with immediate impact to the mine plan, and to investigate the Silver Queen vein structure in the South-East section where historical underground development appears on historic maps but has not been evidenced in historic extraction reports.\nUpcoming Event\nMr. Thomas M. Clay, Chairman and CEO will be a speaker at the 2018 Vancouver Resource Investment Conference. The presentation will take place on Sunday, January 21st at 11:20am in the Vancouver Convention Centre West.\nAbout Golden Queen Mining Co. Ltd.:\nGolden Queen is a gold and silver producer holding a 50% interest in an open pit, heap leach mining operation on the Soledad Mountain property, located just outside the town of Mojave in Kern County in Southern California.
