The co-pilot was also killed, along with a family of five from New York. \nNature Air’s operations manager quit this week and its aerial security director has requested a leave of absence. \n“Nature Air doesn’t have, at the moment, a reliable and effective management structure to guarantee the execution of safe air operations,” said the letter from Cubillo, who has said the investigation could take months. \nInvestigators are analyzing weather conditions at the time of the crash, possible mechanical failures and human error to determine what caused the Cessna 208B Grand Caravan to plummet from the sky shortly after takeoff. \nEarlier this week, Costa Rican authorities raided Nature Air’s offices in what they described as a routine operation to collect information.
