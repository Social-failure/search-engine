Reported diluted EPS from continuing operations under GAAP was a $(0.50) loss in the fourth quarter, primarily due to the net expense of $1.46 billion for the estimated 1 impact of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (U.S. tax reform). Excluding the impact of U.S. tax reform and other specified items, adjusted diluted EPS from continuing operations was $0.74 in the fourth quarter, at the high end of the previous guidance range of $0.72 to $0.74. Abbott issues full-year 2018 guidance for diluted EPS from continuing operations on a GAAP basis of $1.22 to $1.32. Projected full-year adjusted diluted EPS from continuing operations is $2.80 to $2.90, reflecting 14.0 percent growth 2 at the midpoint. In October, Abbott received U.S. FDA clearance for its Confirm Rx™ Insertable Cardiac Monitor (ICM), the world's first and only smartphone-compatible ICM designed to help physicians remotely identify cardiac arrhythmias, and obtained CE Mark for XIENCE Sierra™, the newest generation of the company's gold-standard XIENCE everolimus-eluting coronary stent system. In November, Abbott initiated the U.S. launch of FreeStyle ® Libre, the only continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) system available that comes factory-calibrated and removes the need for routine fingersticks 3 for people with diabetes. In January, Abbott announced that FreeStyle Libre is now available and approved for coverage by the U.S. Center for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS). In December, Abbott received U.S. FDA approval for magnetic resonance (MR)-conditional labeling for its Quadra Assura™ and Quadra Assura MP™ cardiac resynchronization therapy defibrillator (CRT-D) devices and its Fortify Assura™ implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD). With these approvals, Abbott has MR-conditional labeling for its full suite of pacemaker, ICD and CRT-D devices.\n\"2017 was a great year for us – we performed well, our new product pipeline was highly productive and we took some very important strategic steps forward,\" said Miles D.

Refer to tables titled \"Non-GAAP Reconciliation of Comparable Historical Revenue\" for a reconciliation of comparable historical revenue.\nIn Cardiovascular and Neuromodulation, worldwide sales in the fourth quarter were led by double-digit growth in Electrophysiology, Heart Failure, Structural Heart and Neuromodulation. In Electrophysiology, during the fourth quarter, Abbott initiated the U.S. launch of its Confirm Rx Insertable Cardiac Monitor (ICM), the world's first and only smartphone-compatible ICM designed to help physicians remotely identify cardiac arrhythmias. Growth in Structural Heart was driven by MitraClip ® , Abbott's market-leading device for the minimally-invasive treatment of mitral regurgitation. In Heart Failure, sales growth was led by market uptake of Abbott's HeartMate 3™ system, which received U.S. FDA approval in the third quarter of 2017. In Neuromodulation, strong double-digit growth was led by several recently launched products for the treatment of chronic pain and movement disorders.\nIn the fourth quarter, in Rhythm Management, Abbott received U.S. FDA approval for MR-conditional labeling for its Quadra Assura and Quadra Assura MP cardiac resynchronization therapy defibrillator (CRT-D) devices and its Fortify Assura implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD). In Vascular, Abbott obtained CE Mark for its XIENCE Sierra drug-eluting coronary stent system, which enhances its competitive position in this category of the market.\nIn Diabetes Care, worldwide sales increased 33.2 percent on a reported basis in the fourth quarter, including a favorable 5.6 percent effect of foreign exchange, and increased 27.6 percent on an operational basis. Strong double-digit international sales growth was led by FreeStyle Libre, Abbott's revolutionary CGM system. FreeStyle Libre is the only CGM system available that comes factory-calibrated and removes the need for routine fingersticks 3 for people with diabetes. During the fourth quarter, Abbott initiated the U.S. launch of FreeStyle Libre, and in January 2018, Abbott announced that FreeStyle Libre is now available and approved for coverage by CMS.\nABBOTT ISSUES FINANCIAL OUTLOOK FOR 2018\nAbbott is issuing full-year 2018 guidance for diluted earnings per share from continuing operations under Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) of $1.22 to $1.32.\nAbbott forecasts net specified items for the full year 2018 of approximately $1.58 per share.

Economic, competitive, governmental, technological and other factors that may affect Abbott's operations are discussed in Item 1A, \"Risk Factors'' to our Annual Report on Securities and Exchange Commission Form 10-K for the year ended Dec. 31, 2016, and are incorporated by reference. Abbott undertakes no obligation to release publicly any revisions to forward-looking statements as a result of subsequent events or developments, except as required by law.\n1 The provisional estimate of the impact of U.S. tax reform recorded in the fourth quarter of 2017 is based on Abbott's initial analysis of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act and may be adjusted in future periods due to, among other things, additional analysis performed by Abbott and additional guidance that may be issued by the U.S. Department of the Treasury.\n2 Full-year 2018 guidance for diluted EPS from continuing operations on a GAAP basis represents 535.0 percent growth at the midpoint of the range.\n3 Fingersticks are required for treatment decisions when you see Check Blood Glucose symbol, when symptoms do not match system readings, when you suspect readings may be inaccurate, or when you experience symptoms that may be due to high or low blood glucose.\n4 Free cash flow equals operating cash flow less capital expenditures. In 2017, capital expenditures totaled approximately $1 billion.\nAbbott Laboratories and Subsidiaries\nCondensed Consolidated Statement of Earnings\nFourth Quarter Ended December 31, 2017 and 2016\n(in millions, except per share data)\n(unaudited)\n4Q17\n4Q16\n% Change\nNet Sales\n$7,589\n$5,333\n42.3\nCost of products sold, excluding amortization expense\n3,263\n2,312\n41.1\nAmortization of intangible assets\n560\n121\nn/m\nResearch and development\n613\n343\n78.9\nSelling, general, and administrative\n2,462\n1,609\n52.9\nTotal Operating Cost and Expenses\n6,898\n4,385\n57.3\nOperating earnings\n691\n948\n(27.0)\nInterest expense, net\n211\n129\n63.4\nNet foreign exchange (gain) loss\n--\n(2)\nn/m\nOther (income) expense, net\n(94)\n(54)\n69.4\nEarnings from Continuing Operations before taxes\n574\n875\n(34.5)\nTax expense on Earnings from Continuing Operations\n1,438\n110\nn/m\n1)\nEarnings (Loss) from Continuing Operations\n(864)\n765\nn/m\nEarnings from Discontinued Operations, net of taxes\n36\n33\n8.4\n2)\nGain on Sale of Discontinued Operations, net of taxes\n--\n--\n--\nNet Earnings from Discontinued Operations, net of taxes\n36\n33\n8.4\nNet Earnings (Loss)\n$(828)\n$798\nn/m\nEarnings from Continuing Operations, excluding\nSpecified Items, as described below\n$1,303\n$971\n34.2\n3)\nDiluted Earnings (Loss) per Common Share from:\nContinuing Operations\n$(0.50)\n$0.51\nn/m\nDiscontinued Operations\n0.02\n0.02\n--\nTotal\n$(0.48)\n$0.53\nn/m\nDiluted Earnings per Common Share from Continuing\nOperations, excluding Specified Items, as described below\n$0.74\n$0.65\n13.8\n3)\nAverage Number of Common Shares Outstanding\nPlus Dilutive Common Stock Options\n1,746\n1,483\n4)\nNOTES:\nSee tables below for an explanation of certain non-GAAP financial information.\nn/m = Percent change is not meaningful.\nSee footnotes below.\n1)\n2017 Tax expense on Earnings from Continuing Operations includes net expense of $1.46 billion for the estimated impact of U.S. tax reform.
