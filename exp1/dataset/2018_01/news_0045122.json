(the “Company”) (NYSE: UDR ) announced today that the Company’s former Chairman of the Board, CEO and President, John P. McCann, recently passed away.\nMr. McCann served in various capacities within and external to UDR throughout his extensive real estate career and was a pioneer of the real estate investment trust (“REIT”) era. Most notably, Mr. McCann served as CEO of UDR for 27 years, paving the way for the Company’s success for years to come.\nThroughout his career, Mr. McCann’s vision, hands-on approach, business acumen, philanthropic activities and leadership have been influential forces within the REIT industry.

John was a preeminent figure in the REIT industry and had a profound impact on it and its people, during, and after his long tenure as UDR’s leader. Our thoughts are with the McCann family.
