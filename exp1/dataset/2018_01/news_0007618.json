They didn’t detail how authorities plan to enact the curbs. \nSouth Korea said last month that it will restrictively allow cryptocurrency trading on only qualified exchanges and review a possible capital gains tax on crypto trading as a way to restrain the nation’s frenzied speculation. \n“We need regulators to look into the space more closely, the Korean exchanges have become crazy in terms of price differences so these regulatory actions would help the price stability,” Aslam said. “As for the mining operations, China is making the process more difficult for miners, but opportunist have started to focus on Canada which is more regulatory friendly and cheap on the energy front.” SPONSORED FINANCIAL CONTENT ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-08T13:25:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-08T20:30:27.004+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
