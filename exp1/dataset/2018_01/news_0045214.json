Athenex is organized around three platforms, including an Oncology Innovation Platform, a Commercial Platform and a Global Supply Chain Platform. Athenex’s Oncology Innovation Platform generates clinical candidates through an extensive understanding of kinases, including novel binding sites and human absorption biology, as well as through the application of Athenex’s proprietary research and selection processes in the lab. The Company’s current clinical pipeline is derived from two different platform technologies Athenex calls Orascovery and Src Kinase Inhibition. The Orascovery platform is based on the novel oral P-glycoprotein pump inhibitor molecule HM30181A, through which Athenex is able to facilitate oral absorption of traditional cytotoxics, which Athenex believes may offer improved patient tolerability and efficacy as compared to IV administration of the same cytotoxics. The Orascovery platform was developed by Hanmi Pharmaceuticals and licensed exclusively to Athenex for all major worldwide territories except Korea, which is retained by Hanmi. The Src Kinase Inhibition platform refers to novel small molecule compounds that have multiple mechanisms of action, including the inhibition of the activity of Src Kinase and the inhibition of tubulin polymerization during cell division. Athenex believes the combination of these mechanisms of action provides a broader range of anti-cancer activity as compared to either mechanism of action alone. Athenex’s employees worldwide are dedicated to improving the lives of cancer patients by creating more active and tolerable treatments. Athenex has offices in Buffalo and Clarence, New York; Cranford, New Jersey; Houston, Texas; Chicago, Illinois; Hong Kong; Taipei, Taiwan and multiple locations in Chongqing, China.\nCONTACT:\nJim Polson\nTel: +1-716-427-2952\nAthenex, Inc.\nSource:Athenex, Inc.", "external_links": ["https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=6UvlNFjQxg_d6nc8DGaJrxsslfnJEksTqOsFHyKgC8LvhAiMjOrre64oqTExWaVkpdSS8G_BRkIviiZNDj4Scw==", "https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=wWdk2CME5YH2cOw44oelDcH0QzjQ7D4YtzbPQoR2yI7qpgXuV55BOIRSqHYc9mbVmmZ6h_XOKLUzw7MjhsV74cq4ZkUTcSi3bPFGQoELUw4=", "https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=17iMiz5g7c8XsMu6olUjXgAMTyePbd6HfroJPBW3oSnrgnPMkvIgyJJ6vhNkDLZJx4we59EjuXB95Sw7jvjcr_oa_F3gns3AAbq_-QHF6FoJN5F5XZ6pSmY094kNx8Ii"], "published": "2018-01-25T15:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-25T16:26:18.009+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
