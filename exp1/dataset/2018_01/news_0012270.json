Fitch added that it already maintains set and freely-available fee schedules and explains any deviations. \nESMA added that it could provide agencies with “further supervisory guidance to ensure compliance with the relevant requirements”. \nThe work so far has ESMA taken just over a year but it expects firms to start taking action to address its concerns this year and for it to continue next year. \nFor story on ESMA warning on trade repository fees click ($1 = 0.7386 pounds) (Reporting by Marc Jones; Editing by Mark Heinrich)", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-11T17:57:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-11T18:14:42.030+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
