He told reporters he was “the least racist person you have ever interviewed.”\nJames said Americans should stand united against hate.\n“We can’t allow that to stop us from continuing to be together and preach the right word of living and loving and laughing,” he said. “Because would we want to live anywhere else? I don’t think so. We love this place.”\nIn August James, four-time winner of the National Basketball Association’s most valuable player award, slammed Trump for saying there were “some very fine people on both sides” of protests spearheaded by white nationalists in Charlottesville, Virginia, which left one counterprotester dead.\nIn September, James called Trump a “bum” on Twitter after the president withdrew a White House invitation to Warriors guard Stephen Curry, who had said he did not want to meet with Trump to celebrate the Warriors NBA 2016-2017 championship.\nSan Antonio Spurs coach Gregg Popovich, another outspoken Trump critic, on Monday called racism America’s “national sin” and said he did not take Trump at his word.\n“Every time I hear someone say they are not a racist, you know they are,” he told reporters.\nEditing by Bill Trott\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-16T01:01:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-16T01:17:13.001+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
