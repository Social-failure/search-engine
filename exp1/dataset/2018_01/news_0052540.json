Operating earnings are defined as reported earnings adjusted for certain items.\nThe principal difference between reported earnings and operating earnings for the quarter was a tax benefit associated with the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act enacted in December 2017.\nDominion Energy uses operating earnings as the primary performance measurement of its earnings guidance and results for public communications with analysts and investors. Dominion Energy also uses operating earnings internally for budgeting, for reporting to the Board of Directors, for the company's incentive compensation plans and for its targeted dividend payouts and other purposes. Dominion Energy management believes operating earnings provide a more meaningful representation of the company's fundamental earnings power.\nThomas F. Farrell II, chairman, president and chief executive officer, said:\n\"We are very pleased with our record operational and safety performance for the year. In addition, we achieved strong financial results for 2017 and reported operating earnings of $3.60 per share in the middle of our guidance range, despite weather that was significantly below normal.\n\"Construction of the 1,588-megawatt Greensville County combined cycle power station continues on time and on budget. The project is approximately 73 percent complete and is expected to begin commercial operations in late 2018.\n\"We recently received a Limited Notice to Proceed from FERC for the Atlantic Coast Pipeline and the Supply Header Project which allows us to remain on schedule for completion of the projects in the second half of 2019.\n\"Cove Point Liquefaction construction is complete and we are in the final stages of commissioning.\n\"And finally, in December the Dominion Energy Board of Directors established a 2018 dividend of $3.34 per share, subject to quarterly determination and declaration, that represented a 10 percent year-over-year increase.\"\nFull-year 2017 Reported and Operating Earnings Compared to 2016\nReported earnings in 2017 were $1.0 billion higher than full-year reported earnings in 2016. Business segment results and detailed descriptions of items included in 2017 and 2016 reported earnings but excluded from operating earnings can be found on schedules 1, 2, and 3 of this release.\nOperating earnings, in 2017, decreased $58 million as compared to full-year 2016 operating earnings. The decrease is primarily attributable to milder weather in our regulated service territory, a step down in solar investment tax credits, a second Millstone refueling outage and a reduction of Cove Point import contract revenues. Factors offsetting the decrease include growth in our regulated gas and electric businesses, the addition of Dominion Energy Questar and lower operating expenses.\nDetails of fourth-quarter and full-year 2017 operating earnings as compared to 2016 may be found on Schedule 4 of this release.\nOperating Earnings Guidance\nDominion Energy expects 2018 operating earnings in the range of $3.80-$4.25 per share, compared to full-year 2017 operating earnings of $3.60 per share. Positive factors include a return to normal weather in our regulated service territories, one fewer Millstone refueling outage, revenues from Cove Point export contracts, and the benefit of a lower tax rate due to tax reform. The company expects negative factors for the year to include a step down in solar investment tax credits as well as higher financing costs and share dilution.\nFirst-quarter 2018 operating earnings are expected to be in the range of $0.95-$1.15 per share.\nIn providing its operating earnings guidance, the company notes that there could be differences between expected reported earnings and estimated operating earnings for matters such as, but not limited to, acquisitions, divestitures or changes in accounting principles. At this time, Dominion Energy management is not able to estimate the aggregate impact of these items on future period reported earnings.\nConference Call Today\nThe company will host its fourth-quarter earnings conference call at 10 a.m. ET on Monday, Jan. 29, 2018.
