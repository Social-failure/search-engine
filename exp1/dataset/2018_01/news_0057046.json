The Nevada Gaming Control Board will conduct its investigation in a thorough and judicious manner,” Harris was Quote: d as saying.\nA spokesman for Wynn Resorts, Michael Weaver, said the company “will fully cooperate with any review by regulators.”\nReuters was unable to independently obtain a copy of the statement, but one source with knowledge of the situation confirmed that media reports citing the statement were accurate.\nWynn, 76, resigned as finance chairman of the Republican National Committee on Saturday, a day after the Wall Street Journal reported he had routinely subjected women who worked for him to unwanted sexual advances for decades..\nHis former spouse, Elaine Wynn, whom he accused of fomenting false allegations against him, has denied through her lawyer that she did any such thing.\nThe company’s stock dropped more than 10 percent on Friday after publication of the Journal’s article, closing the day at $180.29 per share on the Nasdaq exchange.\nHours later, the Wynn Resorts board said it had formed a special committee to conduct its own inquiry into the accusations. That panel is chaired by Patricia Mulroy, who sits on the board’s corporate governance and compliance committees and is a former member of the Nevada Gaming Commission.\nThe Journal report marked the latest in a wave of sexual abuse and harassment allegations against powerful men in the United State during the past year, especially in the media and entertainment industries and politics.\nThe Journal said its report was based on interviews with dozens of people who had worked for Wynn and that none of the 150 individuals contacted for its story had reached out to the newspaper.\nReporting by Steve Gorman in Los Angeles; Editing by Paul Tait and Neil Fullick\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-31T08:17:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-31T08:29:36.010+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
