Pope Francis leads a mass to mark the World Day of Peace in Saint Peter's Basilica at the Vatican January 1, 2018. REUTERS/Max Rossi \nFrancis reminded some 40,000 people who gathered in St. Peter’s Square at the Vatican that he had chosen the plight of migrants and refugees as the theme for the Roman Catholic Church’s World Day of Peace, which is celebrated every January 1. \n“For this peace, to which everyone has a right, many of them are willing to risk their lives in a journey which is often long and dangerous, they are willing to face strain and suffering.” \n“Please, let us not extinguish the hope in their hearts, let us not suffocate their hopes for peace!” \nAcross the world, the mass movement of people has shot to the top of the political agenda, and Francis has made defending those who migrate a central theme of his papacy. Pope Francis is helped with his hat as he leads a mass to mark the World Day of Peace in Saint Peter's Basilica at the Vatican January 1, 2018.

He acknowledged that the presence of immigrants can compound existing problems in a country, but appealed for practical ways to be found to welcome newcomers. \nOn Monday, he said: “It is important that there is a commitment from everyone, from civil institutions, and those in education, welfare and church organisations, to ensure a peaceful future for refugees, migrants, everyone.” Reporting by Isla Binnie; editing by Jason Neely", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-01T15:36:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-01T15:58:52.009+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
