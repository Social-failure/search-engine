UBS has warned customers about the cryptocurrencies on the grounds they lack sustainable value, he said. \nWeber expects increasing use of cryptocurrencies among broader groups will demand more regulatory scrutiny, something Jordan said is a hot topic. \n“There is an important principle: Similar activities should be similarly regulated,” Jordan said. “And Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies have some characteristics of other investment instruments. You can‘t, on the one hand, heavily restrict cash and on the other hand permit fully anonymous instruments that to a great extent can be used for all manner of transactions.” \nSwitzerland has set up a working group to look into oversight of blockchain technology and initial coin offerings and report back to the government by the end of this year.
