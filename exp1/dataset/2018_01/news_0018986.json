They could have seen him as a competitor, but they really felt he could make everybody stronger, which he did.\nFILE PHOTO: Jordan Belchos of Canada competes during the men's 10000m event at the Essent ISU World Single Distances Championships 2013 in Sochi, Russia March 23, 2013.

REUTERS/Phil Noble/File Photo The popularity of ice hockey in Canada and a network of speed skating clubs means the country has a healthy pool of skaters to chose from.\nMorrison and Bloemen are the senior members of the team at 32 and 31 respectively, while Vincent De Haitre is one of the youngest members in the squad at 23.\n“Vincent de Haitre is a possible medalist in the 1,000 and the 1,500,” Schouten said.\n“And I think we have a good chance in the 500 with two skaters that won gold medals in the World Cups this year, Alex Boisvert-Lacroix and Laurent Dubreuil.”\nIvanie Blondin will challenge for medals in the mass start and the women’s 5,000 and 3,000, and Canada will also send strong teams for both the men and women’s team pursuit.\n“Canada is a really strong team where people are working together well and I think we’ve stepped up a level of performance over the last couple of years,” Schouten said.\n“We’re really looking forward to bringing our best performances in Korea.”\nEditing by Greg Stutchbury\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-15T16:04:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-15T16:22:13.011+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
