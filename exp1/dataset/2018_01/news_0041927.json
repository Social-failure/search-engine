We have to be professional. \n”We’ve been working on that,“ Vertonghen added. ”I think this team has great focus, we know what we want and I‘m very proud of that. \n“We’ve got a professional team that will approach this game against Newport in a very good way. We just have to approach it in the way we approach Premier League games, which we will.” \nTottenham and fourth-tier Newport will face each other for the first time since consecutive FA Cup meetings in 1959 and 1960, with Spurs winning both games. \nNewport are eighth in League Two while Tottenham are fifth in the Premier League.
