Hopefully that situation will settle down.\n“We want to hear what Lewis is up to and he has the biggest following. So if he pulls off social media, that would be a loss for everyone.”\nMercedes have made no official comment on the reasons for Hamilton’s actions, although a team source said it was “just a bit of hygiene” to wipe the slate clean for a fresh start this season.\nAn adviser to Hamilton also had no comment, telling the BBC that “taking a break” from social media during the holiday period was not newsworthy.\nWhile the season starts in Australia in March, January is a quiet time in Formula One when engagement on social media helps maintain the sport’s profile.\n“I think it’s unfortunate how quickly people jump on him (Hamilton),” said Brown of a driver who won his first title with McLaren in 2008.\n“I bet the majority of those people (critics), if they were sitting in front of Lewis, would still want to get his autograph.”\nReporting by Alan Baldwin, editing by Toby Davis\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-01-11T23:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-11T17:08:47.028+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
