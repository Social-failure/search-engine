Other senior GM executives stood by the company’s plans to continue building trucks in Mexico. MICHIGAN GOVERNOR PUSHES NAFTA \nMichigan Governor Rick Snyder, a Republican, met with Vice President Mike Pence in December, urging the administration to improve NAFTA instead of terminating it, which could harm the auto industry. \n“That would be a negative for all three countries,” Snyder told reporters after touring the auto show. Slideshow (2 Images) \nJose Munoz, head of North American operations for Nissan Motor Co, told Reuters the company has boosted U.S. production in recent years. \n“No matter what the new NAFTA rules, we will adjust very fast so we can maximize our business,” he said. “The more localized you are the less exposed you are to potential changes.” \nUnder NAFTA, at least 62.5 percent of the material in a car or light truck made in the region must be from North America to be able to enter the marketplace tariff-free. \nThe Trump administration has proposed increasing that minimum NAFTA content to 85 percent, with 50 percent made in the United States. \nThe 85 percent North American content proposal to avoid tariffs is unworkable, Toyota North America Chief Executive Jim Lentz told Reuters. \n”There’s not a vehicle that meets that,” he said. \nLentz said since NAFTA was agreed 14 auto plants have been built in the United States – eight by Toyota – and 11 in Mexico. \n“It’s not like we are not investing in the United States,” Lentz said. \nMarchionne also said the 85 percent figure is not feasible. “I’m hopeful that we’ll see a more rational number going forward and if it is more rational, then I think we’ll be able meet the standard,” he said. \nA NAFTA breakup would raise costs, slow demand and put U.S. jobs in jeopardy, Lentz said. \nVolkswagen AG ( VOWG_p.DE ) brand CEO Herbert Diess said the automaker wasn’t preparing for NAFTA’s demise. \nThe U.S. auto industry has worked to convince the Trump administration of NAFTA’s importance. In October, major automakers, suppliers and auto dealers launched a coalition to back the agreement.
