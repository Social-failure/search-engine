Media were not allowed to attend.\nCarney has been criticised by Brexit supporters for previous public comments he has made on the impact of a vote to leave the bloc on Britain’s economy.\nReporting by Andy Bruce; Editing by William Schomberg\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-01-25T18:16:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-25T12:52:28.002+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
