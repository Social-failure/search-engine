REUTERS/David McNew/File Photo The hotel is located in the town of Todos Santos on Baja California Sur, about 1,000 miles (1,609 km) south of San Diego and 48 miles (77 km) north of Cabo San Lucas.\n“Hotel California” is known for abstract lyrics that lead singer Don Henley has said describe excess in America. The song appears on an album with the same title.\nHotel California Baja said the hotel “claims no association with the Eagles or with their song and record album ‘Hotel California.'”\nThe hotel’s owners are not affiliated with the Eagles, the hotel’s website says, although “many visitors are mesmerized by the ‘coincidences’ between the lyrics of the hit song and the physicality of the hotel and its surroundings.”\nReporting by Jonathan Stempel in New York; Editing by Jeffrey Benkoe\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-19T16:35:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-19T16:53:41.008+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
