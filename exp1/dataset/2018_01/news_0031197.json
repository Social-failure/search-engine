They were found to contain logs that, if laid in a line, would stretch for 1,500 kilometers (930 miles), the police said. \nAbout half of the logs were bound for export to the United States or Europe, they added. \nThe Amazon, most of which is located in Brazil, is the world’s largest tropical rainforest and soaks up vast amounts of carbon dioxide. \nBrazil’s efforts to protect the forest, which experts say is important to curbing global warming, have been mixed in recent years. In October, the country’s environment ministry said that overall Amazon deforestation fell 16 percent for the year through July 2017. However, that was the first drop in three years.
