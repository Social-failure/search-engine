The Avalanche have won three of their five matchups against Dallas this season and are within a point of the Stars for the final playoff spot in the Western Conference.\nMacKinnon broke a 1-1 deadlock 6:33 into the third period as he took a pass from Alexander Kerfoot just inside the left faceoff circle and whipped a wrist shot past Dallas goaltender Ben Bishop. Nikita Zadorov also got an assist on the play.\nBlake Comeau cemented the victory with 1:40 to play off a pass from Zadorov. Colorado’s Mark Barberio added a short-handed, empty-net goal with 13 seconds remaining.\nKerfoot put the Avalanche on top at the 14:09 mark of the first period when he took a pass from A.J. Greer at mid-ice, skated into the zone and ripped a shot over the right shoulder of Bishop on the short side. Samuel Girard also got an assist on the play for his pass that cleared the Colorado end of the ice.\nCarl Soderberg seemingly added to the Colorado lead with 12:57 to play in the second period as he fired a rebounded shot past Bishop, but the goal was waved off for goalie interference.\nDallas’ Jamie Benn tied the game when he sent home a rebound of a shot by John Klingberg after Alexander Radulov’s drop pass to Klingberg at 15:43 of the second period.\nAfter the two late Colorado goals, the Stars finished the game on the power play after Comeau and Erik Johnson received penalties in a scrum just inside the Dallas zone with 1:16 remaining. However, Dallas could not dent the Avalanche’s lead.\nDallas is now 6-3-2 in its past 11 games but fell to 16-6-1 at home. Bishop started his 11th straight game and has allowed two goals or fewer in five of his past nine contests, recording two shutouts. He finished with 19 saves Saturday.\nColorado returns home for a game Monday against the Anaheim Ducks. The Stars hit the road for a match Monday afternoon against the Bruins in Boston.\n--Field Level Media\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-01-14T13:12:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-14T20:26:56.042+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
