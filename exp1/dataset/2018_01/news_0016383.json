An Air France spokeswoman declined to comment.\n“I’ll ask them (the commissioners) to give me the details not only about the offers, but about what kind of offers they are,” Calenda said during the taping of a talk show for La7 TV channel. “Afterwards there will be a brief period to understand which of these offers is the best or which can be improved.”\nU.S. private equity fund Cerberus and Germany’s Lufthansa ( LHAG.DE ) have also made offers, he said.\nReporting by Massimiliano Di Giorgio, additional reporting by Cyril Altmeyer, writing by Steve Scherer, editing by Valentina Za\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-01-13T02:59:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-13T06:46:05.006+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
