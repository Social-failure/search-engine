The extent of damage was still unclear.\nThe property firm behind Ayala Center Cebu is owned by Ayala Corp, one of the Philippines’ largest conglomerates.\nReporting by Neil Jerome Morales; Editing by Clarence Fernandez\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-07T11:26:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-07T11:46:26.214+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
