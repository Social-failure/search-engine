They are having tough times out there.” \nMartic said she had taken pain killers after the second set to deal with blisters on her feet because of the heat coming through her shoes from the roasting court surface at Rod Laver Arena. \n“That was really ugly,” she said of the weather. \n“It’s really tough on your feet to play in these conditions.” \nShe added that she had hoped organizers could close the roof, but heard the temperature was two degrees lower than the required threshold. \nThe Australian Open has only twice invoked its extreme heat policy, which involves closing the roofs of the main stadiums and suspending outdoor matches, during heat waves in 2009 and 2014.
