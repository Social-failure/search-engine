The majority of the game we were on top, but there’s always things to learn from.” \nSaturday’s game will mark Howe’s 100th league game in charge, making him the third youngest English manager to achieve this feat, at the age of 40 years and 52 days. \n“To have our 100th Premier League game is a great achievement, but the most important thing will be winning the game... It’s going to be a tough game, but it’ll be huge to get back-to-back wins in the league. It can elevate you.” \nBournemouth are 13th in the league with 24 points and unbeaten in their last four games, while West Ham are 11th with 25 points.
