On average daily, it's receiving 14,036 mentions a day, Swan said.\nThe challenge, which asks teens to swallow the laundry detergent pods, was created in 2015 but has more recently exploded across social media, much to the chagrin of the Tide brand's corporate parent.\nTweet\nTweet\nTweet\nTweet\nP&G has vigorously sought to swipe down the potentially hazardous challenge, even bringing in New England Patriot star Rob Gronkowski to support its efforts.\nA spokesperson from Procter & Gamble previously told CNBC it is working with social networks to remove harmful content, as well as with the American Cleaning Institute to provide information to college students.\n\"Nothing is more important to us than the safety of people who use our products.
