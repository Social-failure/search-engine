Combined with the Moravian culture, we have an unbeatable global team that I'm now proud to lead.\"\n\"We are delighted to announce the proposed acquisition of Moravia which will greatly increase our exposure to the high-growth technology sector, will add a third market leading business of scale to the Group and will extend our global presence,\" added Andrew Brode, Chairman of RWS. \"Its focus on addressing its clients' large, complex and time-critical localization requirements across more than 160 languages and multiple platforms will be an excellent fit alongside our existing market leading intellectual property and life sciences services.\"\n\"I would like to extend my sincere thanks to Tomas for helping to create such an impressive organization, with its strong industry reputation and growth track record, that he is now handing over to Paul in an excellent shape,\" commented Andrew Brode, Chairman of RWS. \"I look forward to working with Paul and Tomas and growing Moravia further as part of the RWS Group.
