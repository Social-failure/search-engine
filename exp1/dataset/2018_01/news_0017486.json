The ABI has called for several changes and has found backing from UK lawmakers.\nThe TSC said in a report last October that the BoE and insurers must find common ground over proposed tweaks to keep the 1.9 trillion pound sector in Britain competitive after the UK leaves the EU in 2019.\nThe PRA is too focused on capital levels and not enough on allowing insurers to compete, the TSC said.\nLawmakers want the PRA to urgently ease the “risk margin”, an add-on capital requirement to cover what a third party would need to safeguard policies if an insurer goes bust.\nBut PRA Chief Executive Sam Woods has so far resisted making unilateral changes to the risk margin, and hopes that the EU would step in before Brexit to change the risk margin have faded.\nWoods is expected to respond to the TSC report when he addresses the ABI’s annual conference on February 27.\nReporting by Huw Jones; editingby Ralph Boulton\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-01-11T19:23:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-12T18:31:22.020+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
