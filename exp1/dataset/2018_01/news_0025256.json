Violators face up to six months in jail, a $1,000 fine or both.\nThe measure, which passed the Democratic-controlled state legislature earlier this month, also bars flying a drone near a prison or in pursuit of wildlife.\nThe drone measure was among 109 bills that Christie signed into law on his last full day in office, spokesman Brian Murray said by email. Christie’s successor, Democrat Phil Murphy, is to be sworn in on Tuesday.\nAt least 38 states are considering restrictions on drone flying this legislative year, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures.\nThe Consumer Technology Association has forecast that 3.1 million drones were sold in the United States last year, up 28 percent from the year before.\nReporting by Ian Simpson in Washington; Editing by Scott Malone and Leslie Adler\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-16T00:18:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-16T00:28:28.003+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
