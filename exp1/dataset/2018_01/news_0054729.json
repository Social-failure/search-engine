Giant said its publicly listed unit, Shanghai Giant Network Technology Co., would buy Playtika from the consortium for 30.5 billion yuan ($4.8 billion) in mostly stock pending regulatory approval.\nThe people familiar with the matter say the China Securities Regulatory Commission is reluctant to approve the sale to Shanghai Giant over concerns that Playtika’s games promote gambling, which is illegal in China except for Macau. The CSRC didn’t respond to a request for comment.\nThe Deal Stands Alone Shanghai Giant Network Technology's purchase of Playtika was the 10th biggest overseas acquisition by a Chinese company in 2016. It is the only deal that hasn't closed.

The company said Playtika’s games don’t meet the legal definition of gambling and aren’t available in China.\nEven so, Giant representatives met with regulators last year to explain how no money is won or lost in play, one of the people said.\nWinning money isn’t possible in Playtika’s games, which can be played for free. Its popular slot-machine game, Slotomania, began as a Facebook game before migrating to online app stores run by Apple and Google. The game earns revenue from the small fraction of players who buy virtual coins, which they can bet and trade in for virtual prizes.\n“Over the past six to nine months, Chinese regulators have said pretty clearly that gambling-specific-type companies are out of bounds,” said Christopher Balding, a professor at the HSBC Business School in Shenzhen. “In 2016, this deal might have been waived through, but in early 2018, it wouldn’t surprise me if it didn’t.”\nChina’s securities regulator received the deal application on Nov. 10, 2016, making it the second-longest among 75 transactions currently in active review. The median time in active review was 75 days as of Jan. 26.\nIndustry analysts and people familiar with the deal say the long delay is a red flag, and a common tactic used by Chinese regulators to kill deals without taking formal action.\nPlaytika was founded in 2010 in Israel and acquired for $100 million the following year by Caesars. Slotomania accounted for one-fifth of global spending on social-casino games in November, the most recent data available, according to SuperData Research Inc.\nSlotomania is a top-grossing app on mobile platforms run by Google and Apple, according to analytics firm App Annie. This month, it briefly became the third-highest grossing app in the Google Play U.S. store and the ninth-highest in Apple’s U.S. App Store, according to App Annie.\nChinese authorities have recently stepped up scrutiny of outbound investments, in particular media and entertainment assets, which tend to be volatile and difficult to price. Amid the clampdown, Dalian Wanda Group abandoned its $1 billion takeover of Golden Globes producer Dick Clark Productions in March 2017. Outbound investments announced by Chinese companies fell by a third last year to $217 billion in deals, according to Dealogic.\n—Chunying Zhang contributed to this article.\nWrite to Wayne Ma at wayne.ma@wsj.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-30T12:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-30T16:13:37.015+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
