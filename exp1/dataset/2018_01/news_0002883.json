You have to invest enormously in manufacturing,” he said.\nBioNTech hit the headlines in July when its experimental personalized cancer vaccine, tailored to the tumors of individual patients, kept disease in check in an early-stage clinical trial.\nThe approach offers a way to widen the use of a new generation of immunotherapy drugs from the likes of Merck & Co ( MRK.N ), Bristol-Myers Squibb ( BMY.N ) and Roche ( ROG.S ) that currently only work for a limited number of patients.\nBy adding a personalized cancer vaccine, scientists believe it should be possible to improve substantially the effectiveness of such immune-boosting medicines.\nBioNTech has already signed a $310 million deal with Roche allowing the Swiss drugmaker to test the vaccine with its marketed immunotherapy drug Tecentriq.\nThe individualized vaccine uses so-called messenger RNA to carry code for making mutated proteins that are specific to a patient’s tumor, prompting specialist T-cells to step up their attack on cancer cells.\nBioNTech, which has around 700 employees at sites in Germany -- more than any other unlisted biotech firm in Europe -- is also working on other cancer-fighting technologies, including antibodies, cell therapies and small molecules.\nIn addition to the deal with Roche’s Genentech unit, it has corporate partnerships with Eli Lilly ( LLY.N ), Sanofi ( SASY.PA ), Genmab ( GEN.CO ) and Bayer Animal Health ( BAYGn.DE ).\nMainz-based BioNTech has yet to make a profit and has been bankrolled for the past decade by majority owners Thomas and Andreas Struengmann, who sold their generic drugs business Hexal to Novartis ( NOVN.S ) in 2005.\nThe latest Series A financing, announced on Thursday, includes a fresh commitment by the Struengmanns, alongside investments from Redmile Group, Janus Henderson Investors, Invus, Fidelity and other European family offices.\nReporting by Ben Hirschler.
