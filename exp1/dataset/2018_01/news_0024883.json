Last year, the government ended a required holding period for foreign capital, and the CNV approved a rule to allow advisers to invest citizens funds’ abroad. \nArgentines declared more than $100 billion in previously hidden wealth in a tax amnesty program last year, broadening the pool of assets that can be invested. \nStill, a sweeping capital markets reform bill that would undo some of former populist President Cristina Fernandez’s interventionist policies has stalled in the opposition-controlled congress. Index provider MSCI surprised investors by not upgrading Argentina to its emerging markets index last year, a move that likely would have spurred investment inflows.
