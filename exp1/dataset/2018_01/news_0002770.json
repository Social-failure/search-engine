They are virtually in every city in Iran. This is the precise picture of a long oppressed people’s rising up against their dictators.” \nHaley said the United States was seeking emergency sessions on Iran at the United Nations in New York and at the U.N. Human Rights Council in Geneva. \n“We must not be silent,” she said. “The people of Iran are crying out for freedom.” Reporting by Rodrigo Campos and Doina Chiacu; Editing by Lisa Shumaker and James Dalgleish", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-02T22:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-02T22:11:09.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
