(NYSE:MOG.A) (NYSE:MOG.B) announced today financial results for the first quarter ended December 30, 2017.\nFirst Quarter Highlights\nSales of $628 million, up 6%; Operating margins of 10.6%, up from 8.9% a year ago; Non-GAAP adjusted diluted earnings per share, excluding the impacts of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the Tax Act), was $.93, up 11% from a year ago; Diluted earnings per share of $.04, including the impacts of the Tax Act; $44 million cash flow from operating activities.\nSegment Results\nTotal Aircraft Controls segment sales in the quarter were $279 million, up 4% year over year. Commercial aircraft revenues increased 10%, to $154 million. Sales of OEM products to Airbus increased 14%, driven by strong A350 sales. Boeing OEM product sales were mostly unchanged, at $61 million. Commercial aftermarket sales increased 27%, to $34 million, on strong A350 initial provisioning spares.\nMilitary aircraft sales in the quarter were $124 million, down 3% from a year ago. Military OEM sales were 2% higher, at $82 million. Military aftermarket sales were down 10%, attributed to lower B-2 and V-22 activity, due to the timing of orders and deliveries.\nIn the quarter, Space and Defense segment sales were $133 million, up 9% year over year. Defense sales were 11% higher on strong sales into military vehicle applications in the U.S and Europe. Space sales were 5% higher, partly due to increased sales of satellite avionics products.\nIndustrial System segment sales in the quarter were $216 million, up 9% from last year. Sales were higher in the four major markets served with particularly strong sales in industrial automation. Higher simulation and test sales reflected increases in auto and aerospace test systems. Energy products were up on sales of exploration and power generation products. Medical sales were higher for a variety of OEM components.\nConsolidated 12-month backlog was $1.3 billion.\nFiscal 2018 Outlook\nThe Company updated its projections for fiscal 2018.\nForecasted sales of $2.62 billion, up 5%, unchanged from 90 days ago; Forecasted full-year operating margins of 11.0%, unchanged from 90 days ago; Non-GAAP full-year adjusted diluted earnings per share of $4.10, plus or minus $0.20, unchanged from 90 days ago, excluding the impacts of the Tax Act; GAAP forecasted range for full-year earnings per share is $3.43, plus or minus $0.20, including the impacts of the Tax Act; Forecast cash flow from operations, including incremental accelerated pension contributions, of $180 million;\n“The quarter got us off to a good start for the year,” said John Scannell, Chairman and CEO. “Earnings per share was above our guidance and we’re pleased to affirm our operating projections from 90 days ago. The recent Tax Act changes resulted in a one-time charge for us in the quarter but we’ll see benefits longer-term.”\nIn conjunction with today’s release, Moog will host a conference call beginning at 10:00 a.m. ET, which will be broadcast live over the Internet.
