The rest of the crew, which included 30 Iranians and two Bangladeshis, remains missing.\nThe salvage team recovered the voyage data recorder, or “black box” from the bridge, before leaving the vessel less than half an hour after boarding because the wind had shifted and “thick toxic smoke” had complicated the operation, Xinhua said.
