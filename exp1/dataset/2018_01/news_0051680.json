Mr. Brown is a senior analyst with Basswood Capital Management, LLC, an alternative asset manager with over $1.4 billion of assets under management.\nMs. Contreras-Sweet’s and Mr. Brown’s appointments expand the size of Regional Management’s Board of Directors from six directors to eight directors. Ms. Contreras-Sweet brings to the Board extensive experience in finance, entrepreneurship, and innovation in both the public and private sectors and, equally important, a genuine passion for the market that Regional Management serves.

Campos, Chairman of the Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee of Regional Management’s Board of Directors. “Maria’s addition allows us to tap into her vast wealth of knowledge gained from over 35 years of public and private sector service, as well as her deep financial, banking, and entrepreneurial expertise, while Jon brings to bear his substantial financial experience and the long-term support of our largest shareholder. Their appointments further strengthen and complement the Board’s deep experience. We believe that Maria’s insight and expansive professional and business network and Jon’s comprehensive analyst experience and familiarity with the broader financial services industry will provide considerable value to the Board and Regional as we continue to execute on our long-term growth strategy.”\nPrior to heading the SBA, Ms. Contreras-Sweet was a founder of ProAmerica Bank, which funds small and medium-sized businesses in Southern California, and served as Executive Chairwoman from 2006 to 2014. Before helping to establish ProAmerica Bank, she was Co-Founder and Managing Partner of Fortius Holdings from 2003 to 2006. Prior to that, she served as Secretary of California’s Business, Transportation and Housing Agency from 1999 to 2003. While in that role, she was also appointed chair to the finance committee of CA-ISO (California Independent System Operator) to help solve the state’s 2000-2001 energy crisis.
