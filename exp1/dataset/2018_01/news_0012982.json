We have to get permission to hold shows in each city and are inspected by veterinarians before permission is given,” he said.\n“Our animals are super-controlled,” he said.\nThe Vatican said a mobile medical clinic would be on hand outside the circus tent on Thursday to treat the visitors’ routine health problems.\nIn recent years, the pope has set up places for the homeless to get showers, hair cuts and shaves near the Vatican. He has also offered them a private tour of the Sistine Chapel and last November hosted about 7,000 of them to a gourmet meal at the Vatican.\nReporting by Philip Pullella; Editing by Alison Williams\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-10T15:34:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-10T15:42:27.035+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
