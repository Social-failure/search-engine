It left the door open to athletes with no history of doping to compete as neutrals, officially known as “Olympic Athletes from Russia”. \nThe Olympic body this week said the exclusion of certain athletes from the list of eligible Russians did not necessarily mean they had doped. \n“Following a detailed and comprehensive invitation process, the IOC confirmed today invitations to 169 athletes who can compete as “Olympic Athlete from Russia”,” the IOC said on Saturday. \n“They were chosen from the pool of 389 athletes who could potentially be invited to the Games depending on available quota places.” \nThe IOC’s statement confirmed an announcement by Stanislav Pozdnyakov, Vice President of the Russian Olympic Committee, on Thursday. \nHe said 169 athletes had been cleared, adding that \nthe top athletes “did not make it on to this list”. \nRussia has repeatedly denied any state involvement in doping.
