It has not yet named the companies.\nSome of the Hong Kong-listed companies with large chunks of non-tradable shares are China Telecom, Zhongan Online P & C Insurance and CGN Power.\nDespite optimism towards the reform, Morgan Stanley said its 2018 outlook for China’s offshore market remains unchanged, saying major shareholders tend to hold their stakes for the long term.\nDrawing parallels with similar ownership reforms for China’s A-shares on the mainlaind launched in 2005, it said noted major share unlocking did not take place until 2008 to 2010.\nIt expects H-share unlocking to peak in 2020.\n“In the long term, full circulation of H-shares is positive for China’s offshore equity market overall. It better aligns shareholders’ interest and attracts more high-quality Chinese domestic companies to list in Hong Kong,” the report said.\nThe announcement of the pilot scheme also lifted shares of investment banking firms and brokerages.\nThomson Reuters data showed the Hong Kong-listed brokerages are up about 6 percent this year, against the broader index gain of 4 percent, as of Thursday’s close.\nHong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Ltd is up about 12 percent this year.\nReporting By Patturaja Murugaboopathy; Additional Reporting by Gaurav Dogra; Editing by Dewey Sim and Sam Holmes\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-01-11T18:38:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-12T18:32:03.014+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
