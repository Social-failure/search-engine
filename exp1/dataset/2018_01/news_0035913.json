These links will then open through a player on Snap’s website.\nSnapchat, known for its messages that disappear seconds after they are read, said Our Stories and Search Stories will be available on the website for 30 days, while Official Stories will disappear after 24 hours.\nThe company also added that it is not ruling out monetization of the stories.\nEarlier this month, Snap said it would partner with Fox Sports to showcase stories with matchday highlights on the FIFA World Cup soccer tournament to be hosted in Russia later this year.\nThe Snapchat app was revamped last November to simplify navigation after complaints that it was difficult to use.\nReporting by Parikshit Mishra and Sonam Rai in Bengaluru; Editing by Martina D'Couto\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-23T16:08:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-23T16:24:41.010+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
