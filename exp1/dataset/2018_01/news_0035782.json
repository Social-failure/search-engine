Some 20 firefighters were at the scene.\nThe emergency prompted police to evacuate 1,450 people from hotels and the Heaven nightclub.\n“Please avoid the area and find alternate travel routes,” the London Fire Brigade said.\nThe railway operator said Charing Cross and Waterloo East stations would remain closed, with some services diverted to other stations and others likely to be canceled. Services were expected to resume by noon, operator Southeastern said.\nReporting by Guy Faulconbridge in London and Subrat Patnaik in Bengaluru; Editing by Gopakumar Warrier and Robin Pomeroy\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-23T09:59:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-23T10:07:40.001+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
