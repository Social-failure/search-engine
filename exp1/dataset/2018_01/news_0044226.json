They were approved through a process that allows states to receive “waivers” from federal Medicaid law in order to test new approaches to the 50-year-old programme.\nWednesday’s lawsuit said that Kentucky’s waiver has “effectively rewritten” the federal Medicaid law, “bypassing congressional restrictions, overturning a half century of administrative practice, and threatening irreparable harm to the health and welfare of the poorest and most vulnerable in our country.”\nThe lawsuit was filed by 15 Kentucky residents enrolled in Medicaid and seeks to represent a class of all Kentucky residents enrolled in the programme since Jan. 18. Attorneys at the National Health Law Program and Southern Poverty Law Center, left-leaning national advocacy groups, are among those representing them.\nReporting By Brendan Pierson in New York; Editing by Bernadette Baum and Susan Thomas\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-24T20:27:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-24T20:53:12.002+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
