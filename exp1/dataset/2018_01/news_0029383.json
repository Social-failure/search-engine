We believe the market is underestimating this risk. Our primary concern for the average high-yield investor is in the limited compensation they are willing to accept for high-yield bonds. We estimate that an average high-yield corporate bond portfolio would earn little more than a current 10-year Treasury on a loss-adjusted basis. Given some of the negative repercussions of tax reform, we recommend that investors focus on companies with less than 30 percent of interest expense to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA), positive cash flow generation, and steady capital expenditures. Many of these same companies are tapping into primary markets to issue debt with fewer protections and at tighter spreads. Altogether, we believe these trends are creating a perfect storm for a significant shakeout in the high-yield universe that will not end well for the average high-yield investor. Now more than ever, investors should take a company-by-company approach to credit selection, and avoid making general decisions based on industry preferences.\nFor more information, please visit http://www.guggenheiminvestments.com .\nAbout Guggenheim Investments\nGuggenheim Investments is the global asset management and investment advisory division of Guggenheim Partners, with $243 billion 1 in assets across fixed income, equity, and alternative strategies.
