UBI CEO Victor Massiah told reporters on the sidelines of an event that UBI was not obligated to sell. \nHe declined to give a target for UBI’s soured loan ratio but said it was “very clear that regulators wish to see a single-digit, and not a double-digit ratio, over a relatively short timeframe.” Reporting by Andrea Mandala, writing by Valentina Za, Editing by Crispian Balmer", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-25T20:07:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-25T20:35:32.010+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
