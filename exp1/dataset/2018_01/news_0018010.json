Brand deliveries were up 9.5 percent to 195,916 cars.\n“I‘m confident BMW sales will continue to grow during 2018, while we also maintain our focus on profitability,” said new sales chief Pieter Nota, who replaced Ian Robertson on Jan. 1.\nVolkswagen’s luxury division Audi is expected to release 2017 car sales later on Friday.\nReporting by Andreas Cremer; Editing by Maria Sheahan\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-01-12T16:04:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-13T14:46:56.008+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
