Last year, Colorado tax revenue since the first dispensaries opened in 2014 topped $500 million.\nOn Jan. 1, California became the largest state to legalize recreational marijuana.\nReporting by Gregory Scruggs, Editing by Ros Russell.; Please credit the Thomson Reuters Foundation, the charitable arm of Thomson Reuters, that covers humanitarian news, women's rights, trafficking, property rights, climate change and resilience.
