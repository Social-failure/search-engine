The U.S. skier was back up quickly and appeared annoyed with herself rather than hurt physically.\nSlideshow (2 Images) The 22-year-old is among the favorites for next monthâ€™s Winter Olympics in Pyeongchang, where she is widely expected to retain the slalom title she won at the 2014 Games in Sochi, Russia. She will also be in contention for gold in both the giant slalom and Super G.\nGerman Viktoria Rebensburg won the race in a combined time of 2 minutes 6.19 seconds. Shiffrin leads the overall World Cup standings on 1,477 points, with Rebensburg second on 634.\nWriting by Brian Homewood in Bern; Editing by John O'Brien and David Goodman\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-23T13:04:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-23T13:15:14.010+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
