He has never been violent in any way to these or any other women,” the lawyers’ statement said.\nThe lawyers said he regretted that he had sometimes subjected actors and actresses to tough and even insulting criticism on set, but said that this never had any connection to the alleged attacks.\nAs many women around the world and some men shared accounts of harassment in the wake of abuse allegations against Weinstein, Wedel said in November he himself had been harassed by gay directors and actors as a young man but had resisted.\nWeinstein, accused of sexual harassment by more than 50 women, has denied having non-consensual sex with anyone.\nReporting by Emma Thomasson; editing by Mark Heinrich\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-04T20:23:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-04T20:37:38.021+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
