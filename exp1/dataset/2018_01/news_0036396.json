WHO WILL TAKE ON MADURO? \nIt is unclear whom the Democratic Unity opposition coalition would attempt to field. \nIts most popular leaders are almost all sidelined from politics - jailed, in exile, or barred from holding office. Months of protests last year failed to dislodge Maduro but resulted in at least 125 deaths. \n“The majority of Venezuelans loathe his government and his circle. If our people are allowed to decide, they are out!” one opposition leader, Henrique Capriles, said. \nCapriles, a two-time presidential candidate, is prohibited from holding office over allegations of “administrative irregularities”. Former mayor Leopoldo Lopez is under house arrest for leading protests against Maduro, while his young protege Freddy Guevara has taken refuge in the Chilean embassy to avoid charges of plotting against Maduro. Related Coverage Factbox: Venezuela's jailed, exiled or barred opposition politicians \nHenry Ramos, the former head of the opposition-led congress, is widely mistrusted among Maduro’s foes due to perceptions of having cut deals with the ruling party. \nThe coalition plans to hold primary elections to choose a candidate. They could also succumb to in-fighting about what conditions to accept in the vote. \nDuring the governors’ election of last October, opposition candidates for the first time gave convincing evidence that elections authorities had altered results in one state, though Maduro scoffed at that and said the system was the cleanest in the world. \nWith cynicism toward all politicians running high among Venezuelans, many are clamoring for a nontraditional, outside candidate. The name of Lorenzo Mendoza, billionaire head of private food company Polar, is on many people’s lips, but he has given no indication of wanting to stand.
