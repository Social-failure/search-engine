Maybe I have a little more experience after my run at the U.S. Open and definitely today I felt comfortable, whereas he looked a bit tight early on. \n“I definitely feel I‘m on top of my game.” Reporting by Martyn Herman; Editing by John O'Brien", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-01-15T15:35:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-15T09:51:23.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
