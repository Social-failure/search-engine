Luc Fortin, who heads TMX’s derivatives-focused Montreal Exchange, will take on the additional role of global head of trading. \nFortin will lead the derivative, fixed income, private markets and equity trading businesses at TMX, which also owns the Toronto Stock Exchange, the TSX Venture Exchange and TSX Alpha Exchange. \nThe management changes coincide with a broader restructuring at TMX, according to the Globe and Mail, which first reported Thadaney’s departure. \nThadaney said in an email that he agreed to stay on for six weeks at TMX as a special advisor to ensure a smooth transition and that after that, he was looking forward to taking his first break in 25 years to spend more time with his family. \nThadaney declined further comment. \nThadaney joined TMX in 2015 after spending 15 years at Investment Technology Group Inc ( ITG.N ), where he was CEO of the brokerage’s Canadian operations.
