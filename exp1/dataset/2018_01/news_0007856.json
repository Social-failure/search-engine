Since then, the government of Prime Minister Narendra Modi has been keen to mandate the use of Aadhaar for everything from filing income taxes to the registration of mobile phone numbers and booking railway tickets.\nReporting by Aditya Kalra; Editing by Tom Lasseter & Simon Cameron-Moore\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-08T13:47:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-08T09:00:58.007+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
