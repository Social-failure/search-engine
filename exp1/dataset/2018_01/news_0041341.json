But the financial industry has been eager to rework the law, saying some of its provisions curb their ability to lend.\nRepublicans have tried for years to revise the law, and only recently have moderate Democrats begun to support modest changes.\nLast month the House passed a bill that would scrap asset thresholds altogether, directing the Fed to focus instead on the business model of a bank when assessing its riskiness and oversight.\nThat bill, sponsored by Republican Blaine Luetkemeyer, drew strong support from lawmakers of both parties, buoying hopes among bank lobbyists that Senate Democrats may yet be persuaded to meet the House halfway.\nOne compromise some regional banks are discussing with lawmakers would keep the $250 billion threshold favored by the Senate but require the Fed to ease rules on banks it considers less risky and to treat lenders with the same business models and risk profiles equally, regardless of their size.\n“Our proposal simply seeks to find middle ground between the Senate and House approaches,” said one regional bank executive. “Equal consideration should be given to the bipartisan efforts in the House.”\nThese changes could be a tough sell.\nThe Senate bill’s sponsors are willing to make minor tweaks to bring more lawmakers to the table but are wary of driving away Democrats needed to support the bill, lobbyists and congressional staff said.\nIt is also unclear if Republican Jeb Hensarling, Crapo’s counterpart in the House and a staunch conservative, would push for Luetkemeyer’s proposal during the negotiations.\nHe authored a sweeping rewrite of Dodd-Frank that passed the House in June but which the Senate largely ignored. That bill, however, did not include Luetkemeyer’s risk-based approach.\nHensarling has called the Senate bill “a good start” but is likely to push for some pieces of his Dodd-Frank rewrite to be included, according to people familiar with his thinking.\nLobbyists said they feared a too-aggressive approach by Hensarling could backfire, leading to an extreme bill that would alienate moderate senators.\nBut the sources close to Hensarling, who will retire at the end of 2018, said he would be willing to compromise.\nHensarling and Crapo declined to comment.\nReporting by Pete Schroeder and Michelle Price; Editing by Lisa Von Ahn\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-25T18:17:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-25T18:38:03.005+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
