The Company is also offering up to 500,000 additional shares of the Series B Preferred Stock, pursuant to the Company’s dividend reinvestment plan (the “DRIP”), to those holders of the Series B Preferred Stock who elect to participate in such plan. Gladstone Securities, LLC (“Gladstone Securities”), an affiliate of the Company, will serve as the Company’s exclusive dealer manager in connection with the offering. The Series B Preferred Stock is being offered by Gladstone Securities on a “reasonable best efforts” basis.\nThe Company expects that the offering of Series B Preferred Stock will terminate on the date (the “Termination Date”) that is the earlier of January 10, 2023 (unless earlier terminated or extended by the Company’s Board of Directors), or the date on which all 6,000,000 shares offered in the Primary Offering are sold. The Company intends to use the net proceeds from this offering to repay existing indebtedness, to fund future acquisitions, and for other general corporate purposes. There is currently no public market for shares of Series B Preferred Stock. The Company intends to apply to list the Series B Preferred Stock on NASDAQ or another national securities exchange within one calendar year after the Termination Date, however, there can be no assurance that a listing will be achieved in such timeframe, or at all.\n“We believe this is a nice way to raise capital at a pace to allow for it to be invested in a more timely manner,” said David Gladstone, President and CEO of the Company. “Over the next five years, we intend to sell some or all of the $150 million allotted for in this offering. We believe this offering will provide the Company with access to the additional capital needed to grow our Company in a way that is not as dilutive to existing common stockholders. Shares of the Series B Preferred Stock will be sold on a ‘reasonable best efforts’ basis over a certain period, which should allow us to invest the new capital as the small amounts are received, as opposed to receiving a large amount of capital all at once from a typical offering, which can often create a drag on earnings until the new capital is fully invested. We believe this offering will allow us to continue growing our Company well into the future at a steady rate, which we hope will also lead to increases in the value of our common stock.”\nThe offering is being conducted as a public offering under the Company’s effective shelf registration statement, filed with the SEC (File No. 333-217042), which became effective on April 12, 2017. To obtain a copy of the final prospectus supplement and the related base prospectus for this offering, please contact: Gladstone Securities, LLC, 1521 Westbranch Drive, Suite 100 McLean, Virginia, 22201, Attn: John Kent.\nThis communication shall not constitute an offer to sell or the solicitation of an offer to buy nor shall there be any sale of these securities in any state or other jurisdiction in which such offer, solicitation or sale would be unlawful prior to registration or qualification under the securities laws of any such state or other jurisdiction.\nAbout Gladstone Land Corporation:\nGladstone Land is a publicly-traded real estate investment trust that invests in farmland located in major agricultural markets in the U.S., which it leases to farmers, and pays monthly distributions to its stockholders.
