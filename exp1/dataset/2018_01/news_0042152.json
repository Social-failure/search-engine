It was last down 0.4 percent at 89.741.\n“It feels like the next few weeks could be a watershed moment for world trade and protectionism,” said ING currency strategist Viraj Patel, in London.\n“(Trump‘s) ‘America First’ ideology...remains a risk strategy for the dollar – and for a U.S. economy that relies on the kindness of strangers to fund its structural external deficit,” he added. “The multi-year trend of a cyclically declining U.S. dollar is now in full motion – and will be difficult to fight against for medium-term investors.”\nAs the dollar fell broadly, the euro hit a fresh three-year peak of $1.2345, while sterling rose to its highest level since Britain’s June 2016 vote to leave the European Union, at $1.4090.\nInvestors are keenly awaiting the European Central Bank’s meeting on Thursday for clues on the outlook for monetary policy in the euro zone.\nAgainst the yen, the dollar fell below the 110 threshold for the first time in four months, last trading down half a percent at 109.72 yen.\nThe yen gained a lift in recent weeks, after the Bank of Japan trimmed its buying of long-dated government bonds in market operations earlier this month, sparking speculation of an eventual exit from its large stimulus.\nAnalysts said such speculation continued to support the yen, even after BOJ Governor Haruhiko Kuroda on Tuesday stressed the importance of patiently continuing with powerful monetary easing.\n“The dilemma here for the Bank of Japan is how do they temper investor expectations?” said Stephen Innes, head of trading in Asia-Pacific for Oanda in Singapore.\n“This is the issue that’s on the table right now beyond the broader negative downtrend in the dollar,” he said.
