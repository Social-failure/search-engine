[RIG/U]\nU.S. crude futures traded around $64 a barrel this week, their highest levels since December 2014.\nDrilling in Canada is seasonal.\nThe Canadian rig count usually increase in January as producers start drilling again after a Christmas break before declining in the spring when the snow melts and it becomes too muddy to operate. The industry calls that snow melt the spring break up.\nThe rig count usually increases again in the summer when the ground dries and holds around those levels through the end of December when the count drops during the last week of the year for the Christmas break.\nIn 2017, the oil rig count jumped from 52 during the last week of 2016 to a high for the year of 207 in February before falling to as low as 24 during the spring break up in April.\nThe count then climbed to 129 rigs during the summer and continued to grow to a high of 134 by mid December as rising crude prices encouraged drillers to add rigs before falling to 62 during the Christmas week of 2017.\nReporting by Scott DiSavino; Editing by Marguerita Choy\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-01-13T04:34:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-13T14:37:56.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
