Fulton, Chief Financial Officer of Hi-Crush. “These strong market fundamentals and encouraging outlook establish the backdrop needed for our management team and the Board of Directors to increase the fourth quarter distribution to $0.20 per unit, up from $0.15 per unit in the prior quarter. Following the resumption of our distribution last quarter, we are pleased to deliver on our objective of sustainable and meaningful growth in our distribution, and are expecting increases of approximately 10% per quarter for the foreseeable future, subject to periodic review. Our capital strategy will remain responsive to the market throughout 2018, and the balance between additional distribution growth and unit repurchases will reflect this flexibility.”\nHi-Crush previously announced that it had repurchased 2,030,163 common units in the fourth quarter of 2017, representing $20 million of unit repurchases since announcing its unit buyback program of up to $100 million in October 2017. This represents the previous maximum amount of unit repurchases allowed for under the Partnership’s previous Term Loan Credit Facility and Revolving Credit Agreement. The Partnership’s new $200 million Senior Secured Term Loan Credit Agreement and new $125 million Revolving Credit Agreement permit unlimited repurchases of common units, allowing for execution up to the remaining $80 million authorized by the Board of Directors. The repurchase program does not obligate the Partnership to repurchase any specific dollar amount or number of units, and may be suspended, modified or discontinued by the Board of Directors at any time, in its sole discretion and without notice.\n“The increase in our fourth quarter distribution, combined with opportunistic purchases on our unit repurchase program, reflects a healthy balance of sustainable capital return that is consistent with our goal of returning value to unitholders over the near and long-term,” said Robert E. Rasmus, Chief Executive Officer of Hi-Crush. “We remain committed to disciplined capital allocation and are laser-focused on executing our Mine. Move. Manage. strategy to enable continued growth in our business and unitholder returns.”\nThe distribution will be paid on February 13, 2018 to all common unitholders of record on February 1, 2018.\nDistributions to Foreign Investors\nThe declaration of the distribution is intended to be a qualified notice to nominees under Treasury Regulation Section 1.1446-4(b), with 100% of the Partnership’s distributions to foreign investors attributable to income that is effectively connected with a United States trade or business. Accordingly, the Partnership’s distributions to foreign investors are subject to federal income tax withholding at the highest effective tax rate.\nAbout Hi-Crush\nHi-Crush is a premier provider of proppant and logistics solutions to the North American energy industry.
