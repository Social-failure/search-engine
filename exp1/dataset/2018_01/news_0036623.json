Most of the reduction will involve back-office employees, although one investment team member is also leaving. \nAckman also plans to go silent, at least for awhile, the people said, a major change in style for one of Wall Street’s most voluble investors. \nThe 51-year-old hedge fund manager, who made his name with winning bets on Allergan Plc ( AGN.N ), Canadian Pacific Railway Ltd ( CP.TO ) and others, became one of the world’s most visible activist investors through lengthy public appearances. He hosted hours-long conferences in Manhattan to answer every question about his short bet against Herbalife and his plan for drugmaker Valeant to buy rival Allergan. \nAckman plans to curtail all of his own marketing and public relations meetings associated with running a big hedge fund, said the people familiar with the matter, who were not authorized to discuss the changes publicly. \nInstead, Ben Hakim, a partner who joined Pershing Square in 2012, will do the traveling and bulk of talking to clients. Ackman will stay in the office, concentrating on financial analysis. \nPershing Square spokesman Francis McGill declined to comment. DINNER DATE FILE PHOTO - William Ackman, chief executive of Pershing Square walks on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange, New York, U.S. on November 10, 2015. REUTERS/Brendan McDermid/File Photo \nAckman plans to announce the personnel changes and new direction on Thursday at the firm’s annual client dinner at the New York Public Library. \nThat dinner, and another similar event in London, will become the once-a-year chance for pension funds, endowments and wealthy investors to see and hear Ackman discuss performance and lay out his strategy, the people said. This time, Ackman will detail how his private funds lost between 1.6 percent and 3.2 percent in 2017. \nFor months, Ackman has been promising a comeback. In the first few weeks of this year, Pershing Square’s funds are up about 2 percent while the stock market has been setting new records, with the S&P 500 Index gaining more than 5 percent year-to-date. \nAs Ackman’s fame and investing prowess grew over the years with successful bets on Canadian Pacific, General Growth Properties and Air Products and Chemicals Inc ( APD.N ), Pershing Square’s assets also grew. But investors traditionally pull 10 percent to 15 percent of capital from a hedge fund every year, making it more difficult for larger firms to keep replacing assets. \nNew clients often demand an audience with the boss, but Ackman has told people he is putting an end to that practice. He still plans to communicate with investors through letters and quarterly calls, and occasionally make public statements about investments. \nHakim and Pershing’s investor relations team will be available to handle day-to-day queries that Ackman previously spent a significant amount of time on. \nIn making the changes, Ackman wants the firm to operate more as it did in 2012, when he won a big proxy contest at Canadian Pacific, people familiar with the matter said. Pershing Square then employed 46 people and managed $11 billion. The firm’s staff peaked at 70 people in 2016. \nOne member of the investment team is among the job cuts, people familiar with the matter said. \nDavid Klafter, a senior lawyer at the firm, will join the investment team to handle legal matters associated with the firm’s bets, which usually total only about a dozen. \nPershing Square’s investment team has historically had between eight and 10 members and will stay at its current size of 10 people, the people said. \nAckman also laid off his driver, saying he can walk or take the subway to his Midtown Manhattan office, the people familiar with the matter said. The staff were told the news of the layoffs late last week.
