It’s growing at 25 percent per annum. Costs for entertainment media companies are exploding and they have no ability to monetize this.”\nReporting by Gertrude Chavez-Dreyfuss; Editing by Richard Chang\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-01-27T02:46:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-26T21:04:38.026+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
