I have no idea. I’ve won three slams now in 12 months. I can’t believe it myself,” the 36-year-old Federer told reporters. \n”I just got to keep a good schedule, stay hungry, then maybe good things can happen. Then I don’t think age is an issue, per se. It’s just a number. \n”But I need to be very careful in my planning, really decide beforehand what are my goals, what are my priorities. \n“I think that’s what’s going to dictate how successful I will be,” added Federer, whose decision to skip the entire claycourt season last year despite being fit paid off when he claimed a record eighth Wimbledon title last July. \n“Exciting times ahead.” \nAlthough speeding to victory in the deciding set, Federer came into the match a bundle of nerves, having been denied a proper semi-final against South Korea’s Chung Hyeon, who retired hurt in the second set. \n“I didn’t fall asleep very well after the Chung match,” said Federer. \n”I think it surprised me that at this stage of a competition in semis, to get a walkover, that was very odd for me. \n”I couldn’t fall asleep until about three in the morning. \n”All of the next day I was already thinking about how should I play Marin, ‘how cool would it be to win 20?', but no, don’t think of it, ‘but how horrible would it be to lose it’. \n“I had it for over 36 hours, to be honest. It was a lot.” \nCilic roared back into the match after the opening set and had break points on Federer’s serve early in the decider. \nThe Swiss said experience and “a bit of luck” had got him over the line to equal Djokovic and Roy Emerson’s record of six Australian Open titles. \n“Defending my title from last year, sort of the fairytale continues,” he said. \n”That’s what stands out for me, maybe not equalling Emerson or Novak. They had their own unbelievable careers. \n“It’s definitely a very special moment in my life again.” (Editing by Pritha Sarkar)", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-28T17:34:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-28T18:37:55.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
