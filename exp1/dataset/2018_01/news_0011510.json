Kodak was a Dow Jones Industrials .DJI component until April 2004, and its stock has slumped 90 percent since it emerged from bankruptcy in 2013.\nSeveral other companies in recent weeks have been rewarded with sharp rises in share price after announcing their transformation into cryptocurrency businesses.\n“This is getting ridiculous,” said Dennis Dick, a proprietary trader at Bright Trading LLC in Las Vegas. “From a fundamental point of view, none of this makes sense.”\nRiot Blockchain ( RIOT.O ) shares have tripled since October when the former biotechnology firm changed its name and said it was revising its business focus to bitcoins.\nSoft drinks maker Long Island Iced Tea has more than doubled since it said it was shifting its focus to blockchain technology and changing its name to Long Blockchain Corp ( LBCC.O ).\nAlso on Tuesday, Inpixon ( INPX.O ) surged 9 cents or 40 percent to 31 cents per share after the data analytics company announced it would adopt blockchain technology.\nWENN Digital belongs to WENN Media, which provides photos to websites and media.\nReporting by Noel Randewich, Editing by G Crosse and Matthew Lewis\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-09T20:44:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-09T20:53:10.049+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
