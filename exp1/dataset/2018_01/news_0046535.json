Global unit volume increased 3.0%, pricing decreased 1.0% and foreign exchange was positive 2.5%. Organic sales (Net sales excluding the impact of foreign exchange, acquisitions and divestments) increased 2.0%.\nNet income and Diluted earnings per share in fourth quarter 2017 were $323 million and $0.37, respectively. Net income in fourth quarter 2017 included $61 million ($0.07 per diluted share) of aftertax charges resulting from the Company’s Global Growth and Efficiency Program and a provisional charge of $275 million ($0.31 per diluted share) related to U.S. tax reform.\nNet income and Diluted earnings per share in fourth quarter 2016 were $606 million and $0.68, respectively. Net income in fourth quarter 2016 included $54 million ($0.06 per diluted share) of aftertax charges resulting from the Global Growth and Efficiency Program and an aftertax charge of $7 million ($0.01 per diluted share) for a litigation matter.\nExcluding charges resulting from the Global Growth and Efficiency Program in both periods, the charge related to U.S. tax reform in 2017 and the charge for a litigation matter in 2016, Net income in fourth quarter 2017 was $659 million, a decrease of 1% versus fourth quarter 2016, and Diluted earnings per share in fourth quarter 2017 was $0.75, even with fourth quarter 2016.\nGross profit margin was 59.8% in fourth quarter 2017 versus 60.4% in fourth quarter 2016. Excluding charges resulting from the Global Growth and Efficiency Program in both periods, Gross profit margin was 60.4% in fourth quarter 2017, a decrease of 40 basis points versus the year ago quarter, as higher raw and packaging material costs and lower pricing were partially offset by cost savings from the Company’s funding-the-growth initiatives.\nSelling, general and administrative expenses were 35.3% of Net sales in fourth quarter 2017 versus 33.7% of Net sales in fourth quarter 2016. Excluding charges resulting from the Global Growth and Efficiency Program in both periods, Selling, general and administrative expenses increased 160 basis points to 34.5% of Net sales in fourth quarter 2017 as a result of increased advertising investment. Worldwide advertising investment increased 24% to $369 million versus $297 million in the year ago quarter.\nOperating profit decreased to $924 million in fourth quarter 2017 compared to $955 million in fourth quarter 2016. Operating profit in both periods included charges resulting from the Global Growth and Efficiency Program. Operating profit in fourth quarter 2016 also included a charge for a litigation matter. Excluding these items in both periods, as applicable, Operating profit was $1,011 million in fourth quarter 2017, a decrease of 3% versus fourth quarter 2016. Operating profit margin was 23.7% in fourth quarter 2017 versus 25.7% in fourth quarter 2016. Excluding the above noted items in both periods, as applicable, Operating profit margin was 26.0% in fourth quarter 2017, a decrease of 190 basis points versus the year ago quarter. This decrease in Operating profit margin was primarily due to an increase in Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of Net sales, reflecting increased advertising investment.\nNet cash provided by operations year to date decreased to $3,054 million compared to $3,141 million in the comparable 2016 period, primarily due to the timing of income tax payments. Working capital as a percentage of Net sales increased to (2.0)% compared to (2.2)% in the year ago period, reflecting the Company's continued tight focus on working capital.\nIan Cook, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer, commented on the fourth quarter results, “We finished the year with an acceleration of our top-line growth worldwide. Net sales in the fourth quarter increased 4.5% and organic sales grew 2.0%. This growth was driven by healthy volume increases across Latin America, North America and Europe.\n“Advertising investment increased both absolutely and as a percent to sales versus year ago across every operating division in the fourth quarter and for the year. We intend to increase our advertising investment in 2018 and to maintain the continuity of that investment throughout the year in support of new products, our base businesses and longer-term consumption-building activities.\n“Colgate’s leadership of the global toothpaste market continued during the quarter with our global market share now at 43.3% year to date. Our global leadership in manual toothbrushes also continued with Colgate’s global market share in that category now at 32.6% year to date.”\nMr. Cook continued, “As we look ahead to 2018, while uncertainty in global markets and category growth worldwide remain challenging, we are maintaining our heightened focus on brand building and increased productivity. Based on current spot rates, we expect a mid-single-digit net sales increase and low to mid-single-digit organic sales growth in 2018, with improvement in organic sales growth versus the second half of 2017.\n“On a GAAP basis, based on current spot rates and including the impact of the Global Growth and Efficiency Program, we are planning for a year of gross margin expansion and expect double-digit earnings per share growth, including the impact of U.S. tax reform.\n“Excluding charges resulting from the Global Growth and Efficiency Program and the one-time charge related to U.S. tax reform in 2017, based on current spot rates, we are planning for a year of increased operating cash flow, gross margin expansion, increased advertising investment and low double-digit earnings per share growth, including the impact of U.S. tax reform. Reflecting the U.S. tax reform, we expect our 2018 tax rate to be in the range of 26% to 27%, both on a GAAP basis and excluding the impact of the Global Growth and Efficiency Program.”\nAt 11:00 a.m. ET today, Colgate will host a conference call to elaborate on fourth quarter results.

This decrease in Operating profit as a percentage of Net sales was primarily due to a decrease in Gross profit and an increase in Selling, general and administrative expenses, both as a percentage of Net sales. This decrease in Gross profit was primarily driven by higher raw and packaging material costs and lower pricing, partially offset by cost savings from the Company’s funding-the-growth initiatives and the Global Growth and Efficiency Program. This increase in Selling, general and administrative expenses was due to higher overhead expenses and increased advertising investment.\nIn the U.S., Colgate widened its leadership in the toothpaste category during the quarter with its market share at 35.5% year to date.

Organic sales for Latin America increased 2.5%.\nOperating profit in Latin America decreased 6% in fourth quarter 2017 to $284 million, or 310 basis points to 29.1% of Net sales. This decrease in Operating profit as a percentage of Net sales was primarily due to a decrease in Gross profit and an increase in Selling, general and administrative expenses, both as a percentage of Net sales.

This increase in Selling, general and administrative expenses was due to increased advertising investment, partially offset by lower overhead expenses.\nColgate maintained its oral care leadership in Europe during the quarter, with toothpaste market share gains in Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Belgium and Austria.

CL-E\nThe Company's annual meeting of stockholders is currently scheduled for Friday, May 11, 2018.\nMarket Share Information\nManagement uses market share information as a key indicator to monitor business health and performance. References to market share in this press release are based on a combination of consumption and market share data provided by third-party vendors, primarily Nielsen, and internal estimates. All market share references represent the percentage of the dollar value of sales of our products, relative to all product sales in the category in the countries in which the Company competes and purchases data (excluding Venezuela from all periods). The Company measures year-to-date market shares from January 1 of the relevant year through the most recent period for which market share data is available, which typically reflects a lag time of one or two months. The Company believes that the third-party vendors it uses to provide data are reliable, but it has not verified the accuracy or completeness of the data or any assumptions underlying the data. In addition, market share information calculated by the Company may be different from market share information calculated by other companies due to differences in category definitions, the use of data from different countries, internal estimates and other factors.\nU.S. Tax Reform\nThe Company’s provisional estimate of the one-time charge relating to U.S. tax reform is based on the Company’s initial analysis of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “Act”) as of January 22, 2018 and information and estimates available as of that date. Given the significant complexity of the Act, anticipated guidance from the U.S. Treasury about implementing the Act, the potential for additional guidance from the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) or the Financial Accounting Standards Board related to the Act and additional information becoming available, this estimate may be adjusted during 2018.\nCautionary Statement on Forward-Looking Statements\nThis press release and the related webcast may contain forward-looking statements (as that term is defined in the U.S. Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 or by the SEC in its rules, regulations and releases) that set forth anticipated results based on management’s current plans and assumptions. Such statements may relate, for example, to sales or volume growth, organic sales growth, profit or profit margin growth, earnings per share growth (including on a currency-neutral basis), financial goals, the impact of foreign exchange volatility, cost-reduction plans including the Global Growth and Efficiency Program, tax rates, U.S. tax reform, the need to repatriate undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries, new product introductions or commercial investment levels, acquisitions, divestitures, or legal or tax proceedings, among other matters. These statements are made on the basis of the Company’s views and assumptions as of this time and the Company undertakes no obligation to update these statements whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, except as required by law or by the rules and regulations of the SEC. Moreover, the Company does not, nor does any other person, assume responsibility for the accuracy and completeness of these statements. The Company cautions investors that any such forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and that actual events or results may differ materially from those statements. For more information about factors that could impact the Company’s business and cause actual results to differ materially from forward-looking statements, investors should refer to the Company’s filings with the SEC (including, but not limited to, the information set forth under the captions “Risk Factors” and “Cautionary Statement on Forward-Looking Statements” in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2016 and subsequent Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q). Copies of these filings may be obtained upon request from the Company’s Investor Relations Department or on the Company’s website at http://www.colgatepalmolive.com .\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nThe following provides information regarding the non-GAAP financial measures used in this earnings release and/or the related webcast:\nThis release discusses Net sales growth (GAAP) and organic sales growth, which is Net sales growth excluding the impact of foreign exchange, acquisitions and divestments (non-GAAP). Management believes the organic sales growth measure provides investors and analysts with useful supplemental information regarding the Company’s underlying sales trends by presenting sales growth excluding the external factor of foreign exchange as well as the impact from acquisitions and divestments. See “Geographic Sales Analysis Percentage Changes” for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2017 vs 2016 included with this release for a comparison of organic sales growth to Net sales growth in accordance with GAAP.\nTo supplement Colgate’s Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income presented in accordance with GAAP, the Company has disclosed non-GAAP measures of operating results that exclude certain items. Worldwide Gross profit, Gross profit margin, Selling, general and administrative expenses, Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of Net sales, Other (income) expense, net, Operating profit, Operating profit margin, Effective income tax rate, Net income attributable to Colgate-Palmolive Company and Diluted earnings per common share are discussed both as reported (on a GAAP basis) and excluding charges resulting from the Global Growth and Efficiency Program and, as applicable, a gain on the sale of land in Mexico, benefits from tax matters, a charge related to U.S. tax reform and a charge for a litigation matter (non-GAAP). These non-GAAP financial measures exclude items that, either by their nature or amount, management would not expect to occur as part of the Company’s normal business on a regular basis, such as restructuring charges, charges for certain litigation and tax matters, gains and losses from certain divestitures and certain unusual, non-recurring items. Investors and analysts use these financial measures in assessing the Company’s business performance, and management believes that presenting these financial measures on a non-GAAP basis provides them with useful supplemental information to enhance their understanding of the Company’s underlying business performance and trends. These non-GAAP financial measures also enhance the ability to compare period-to-period financial results. See “Non-GAAP Reconciliations” for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 included with this release for a reconciliation of these financial measures to the related GAAP measures.\nThe Company uses these financial measures internally in its budgeting process, to evaluate segment and overall operating performance and as factors in determining compensation. While the Company believes that these financial measures are useful in evaluating the Company’s underlying business performance and trends, this information should be considered as supplemental in nature and is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the related financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. In addition, these non-GAAP financial measures may not be the same as similar measures presented by other companies.\nThe Company defines free cash flow before dividends as Net cash provided by operations less Capital expenditures. As management uses this measure to evaluate the Company’s ability to satisfy current and future obligations, repurchase stock, pay dividends and fund future business opportunities, the Company believes that it provides useful information to investors. Free cash flow before dividends is not a measure of cash available for discretionary expenditures since the Company has certain non-discretionary obligations such as debt service that are not deducted from the measure. Free cash flow before dividends is a non-GAAP measure and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. See “Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows” for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 for a comparison of free cash flow before dividends to Net cash provided by operations as reported in accordance with GAAP.\n(See attached tables for fourth quarter results.)\nTable 1 Colgate-Palmolive Company Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income For the Three Months Ended December
