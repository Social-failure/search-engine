It now offers rides with licensed taxi drivers in Berlin and Munich but is a small player in the country’s taxi market.\n“Germany as a market for Uber is a market with enormous promise that hasn’t been realised,” Khosrowshahi said. “Our strategy on Germany is a total reset.”\nHe said Uber was also talking to officials in London after transport authorities pulled its license to operate last September, saying Uber was not “fit and proper” to run a taxi service.\nKhosrowshahi said Uber had committed over time to running a more environmentally friendly fleet in London, including hybrid electric vehicles, “if they let us back in which I hope they will.”\nOn an upbeat note, he said the company’s expansion into food delivery will make it the largest company in the category in 2018, four years after it first launched Uber Eats in the United States, and then overseas.\nUber Eats now operates in 220 cities worldwide.\nUber's range of different ride-hailing services are active in more than 80 countries and nearly 700 cities, the company says, but Khosrowshahi has been handicapped by continued fallout from decisions taken by Kalanick.

There was a bit of a pirate mentality,” he said.\nReporting by Eric Auchard and Douglas Busvine; Editing by Arno Schuetze and Susan Fenton\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-22T16:50:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-22T17:24:53.054+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
