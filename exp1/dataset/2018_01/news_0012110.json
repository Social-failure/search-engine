It makes insecticides, fungicides, bio-fertilizers and chemical-based fertilizers.\nOn Monday it filed a registration statement with the SEC for a proposed initial public offering of American depositary shares (ADSs) representing its ordinary shares. The number of ADSs to be offered and the price range for the proposed offering have not yet been determined.\nBioceres also has filed a petition to offer its ordinary shares in Argentina before the local market regulator.\nForeign investors have been seeking more opportunities to buy Argentine equities since market-friendly President Mauricio Macri took office in December 2015.
