The next generation communication technology is supposed to be at least 10 times faster than the 4G network. \nThe firm said 9.1 billion yuan of the funds raised would be used for 5G technology research and product development and 3.9 billion yuan to replensh working capital. \n“The company expects that 2018 to 2020 will be a crucial period for the formulation and industrialization of the global standard for 5G technology,” ZTE said in its filing. \nZTE’s Shenzhen-listed shares closed at 31.12 yuan on Wednesday before the announcement.
