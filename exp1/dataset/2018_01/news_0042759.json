Under his leadership, Mulvany said, industry will have a voice.\n“We work for the people. That means everyone: Those who use credit cards and those who provide the credit,” he wrote.\nThe CFPB was created to stamp out exploitative loans, but the agency also can be too concerned with punishing industry, wrote Mulvaney.\nReporting By Patrick Rucker; Editing by Cynthia Osterman\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-01-24T06:39:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-24T15:24:50.009+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
