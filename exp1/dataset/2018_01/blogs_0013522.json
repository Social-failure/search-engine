Connecting cars to each other and to other devices, such as stoplights, can improve traffic flow in dense areas by coordinating the movement of vehicles. \n\"At its most basic level CV2X is a two way conversation,\" said Don Butler, Ford's executive director of connected vehicle and services, at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas on Tuesday. He added that the data collected from these simple interactions can be used to managed complex transportation systems.\nConnected cars could be rerouted around cities to avoid traffic jams, barriers, or accidents, for example. They could detect that a driver or passenger is in distress, and take the appropriate action, Butler said. They could also receive signals from a hidden pedestrian's mobile phone in order to avoid a collision. \nFord already has 700,000 connected car on the road, and wants every new car to be enabled with C-V2X technology by 2019, Butler said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-09T20:17:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-09T20:34:02.044+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
