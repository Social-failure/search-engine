Israel has granted asylum to fewer than one percent of those who have applied and has a years-long backlog of applicants.\nRights groups have accused Israel of being slow to process African migrants’ asylum requests as a matter of policy and denying legitimate claims to the status.\nNetanyahu has called the migrants’ presence a threat to Israel’s social fabric and Jewish character, and one government minister has referred to them as “a cancer”.\nTeklit Michael, a 29-asylum seeker from Eritrea living in Tel Aviv, said in response to the Israeli plan that paying money to other governments to take in Africans was akin to “human trafficking and smuggling”.\n“We don’t know what is waiting for us (in Rwanda and Uganda),” he told Reuters by telephone. “They prefer now to stay in prison (in Israel) instead.”\nIn his remarks, Netanyahu cited the large presence of African migrants in Tel Aviv’s poorer neighborhoods, where he said “veteran residents” - a reference to Israelis - no longer feel safe.\n“So today, we are keeping our promise to restore calm, a sense of personal security and law and order to the residents of south Tel Aviv and those in many other neighborhoods,” he said.\nAdditional reporting by Miriam Berger; Editing by Raissa Kasolowsky\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-03T14:05:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-03T14:17:05.001+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
