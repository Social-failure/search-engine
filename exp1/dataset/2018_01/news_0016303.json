Trump had often complained about U.S. libel laws on the 2016 campaign trail.\n“We are going to take a strong look at our country’s libel laws so that when somebody says something that is false and defamatory about someone, that person will have meaningful recourse in our courts,” Trump said.\nU.S. President Donald Trump, flanked by Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke and Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, holds a cabinet meeting at the White House in Washington, U.S., January 10, 2018. REUTERS/Jonathan Ernst To prove libel, a public figure must show a writer or publisher acted with actual malice in publishing a false statement. Malice is either reckless or purposeful disregard for the truth.\nIn what was seen as an attempt to show Trump is mentally fit and in command, the president had kept a pool of reporters, including a TV camera, inside of a meeting he had on Tuesday with U.S. lawmakers on immigration.\nReporters would have typically been escorted out after a few opening remarks, but they were kept in the meeting for 55 minutes as Trump and his Republicans debated immigration policy and ideas with Democratic members.\nOn Wednesday in the same room when Trump met members of his Cabinet, the president was ecstatic that TV networks had focused heavy attention on the immigration meeting.\n“Some of them called it a performance. I consider it work,” Trump said.\nReporting by Steve Holland; Editing by Marguerita Choy\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-10T19:39:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-10T19:50:22.019+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
