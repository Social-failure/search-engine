China was targeting a deficit equivalent to 3 percent of GDP in 2017. \nThe figures are subject to revisions and the final amount of the deficit may be lower than preliminary indications. $1 = 6.3196 Chinese yuan Reporting by Beijing Monitoring Desk and Elias Glenn; Editing by Jacqueline Wong", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-25T12:33:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-25T12:59:59.023+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
