If the negotiations are successful, the deal could be announced as early as this week, the sources added, asking not to be identified because the matter is confidential. There is always a chance the deal talks end unsuccessfully, the sources added.\nSS&C and DST did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\nDST shares jumped 23 percent on the news to $80.68, giving it a market capitalization of $4.8 billion. SS&C shares rose 11 percent to $46.78 per share.\nSS&C, which is based in Windsor, Connecticut, and has a market capitalization of close to $9 billion, has been acquisitive over the years building out its financial technology software expertise that serves banks and the investment industry. DST would be SS&C&rsquo;s largest deal to date and its first big acquisition since its $2.3 billion takeover of Advent Software in 2015.\n“Acquisitions have been a key part of SS&C&rsquo;s growth story. DST, with roughly 80 percent of revenue stemming from investment fund data processing and fund administration, would seem to be a good fit,” Peter Heckman, research analyst at D.A. Davidson, said in an email.\nHeckman added that SS&C, which has $103 million in cash and $2.26 billion in debt, would need to borrow more to make the deal happen, but he expects cost savings and potential divestitures to help.\nAn $84 per share offer by SS&C represents a 29 percent premium to DST’s closing share price on Tuesday.\nSS&C and DST have had dealings in the past. In 2014, DST sold its global solutions unit to SS&C for $95 million in cash.\nReporting by Liana B.
