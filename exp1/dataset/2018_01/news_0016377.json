Expectations among Venezuelans for a deal this time around are low.\nOpposition coalition Democratic Unity “is attending the meeting in good faith, to seek a way of allowing Venezuelans to build a route to the future,” tweeted party lawmaker Luis Florido on Thursday.\nThe opposition leaders are demanding that Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro accept humanitarian assistance from abroad to ease a crisis that has led to shortages of food and basic goods for millions of people.\nThey are also calling for the release of several hundred jailed political activists.\nMexico's Foreign Minister Luis Videgaray (R) talks with his counterparts from Nicaragua Denis Moncada (L) and Bolivia, Fernando Huanacuni, during a round of talks with delegates of President Nicolas Maduro's government and Venezuela's opposition coalition, in Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic January 12, 2018.
