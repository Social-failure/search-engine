(NYSE American:URG, TSX:URE)(the \"Company\" or \"Ur-Energy\") is pleased to provide the following operational results for fourth quarter 2017, and to announce a webcast regarding 2017 Operational Results and current events in the uranium industry, to be held on Friday, January 19, 2018, at 9:00 a.m. MT / 11:00 a.m. ET.\nHighlights\nLost Creek Operations\nUnits\n2017 Q1\n2017 Q2\n2017 Q3\n2017 Q4\n2017\nU 3 O 8 Captured\n('000 lbs)\n79.3\n65.3\n52.8\n68.0\n265.4\nU 3 O 8 Dried & Drummed\n('000 lbs)\n74.4\n70.8\n48.3\n60.5\n254.0\nU 3 O 8 Sold (from production)\n('000 lbs)\n50.0\n31.0\n180.0\n0.0\n261.0\nU 3 O 8 Sold (from purchased lbs)\n('000 lbs)\n200.0\n210.0\n109.0\n0.0\n519.0\nAverage Flow Rate\n(gpm)\n2,403\n2,378\n2,188\n2,244\n2,302\nU 3 O 8 Head Grade\n(mg/l)\n32\n27\n23\n29\n28\nLost Creek Uranium Production and Sales\nFor the quarter, 67,982 pounds of U 3 O 8 were captured within the Lost Creek plant, 60,461 pounds of U 3 O 8 were packaged in drums and 73,367 pounds of U 3 O 8 drummed inventory were shipped out of the Lost Creek processing plant. At December 31, 2017, inventory at the conversion facility was approximately 94,077 pounds U 3 O 8 .\nIn 2017, sales totaled $38.3 million from 780,000 pounds sold. Our overall price per pound sold averaged $49.09. There were no spot sales during the year. A total of 261,000 pounds were sold from Lost Creek production. Additionally, we delivered 519,000 purchased pounds into contractual obligations. Purchases for these deliveries averaged $21.35 per pound.\nLost Creek Production Operations in Mine Unit 1 and Development of Mine Unit 2\nLost Creek celebrated its fourth anniversary of operations in August. At year-end 2017, we have captured approximately 2.4 million pounds U 3 O 8 and have delivered approximately 2.2 million pounds of Lost Creek production to our customers. At this time, our first mine unit (\"MU1\") has recovered nearly 89% of the estimated under-pattern resource, based upon the revised and updated Lost Creek Preliminary Economic Assessment (as amended, February 2016, the \"PEA\"). This is compared to an accepted industry standard of 70% to 80% recovery of under-pattern resource. As well, project economics in the PEA were based on an 80% recovery.\nDrilling and other construction work to develop the first three header houses in Mine Unit 2 (\"MU2\") commenced in early April 2017, allowing us to bring the first header house online in late August. Operations in the second header house in MU2 are expected to commence this week; we anticipate the third header house will come online in Q1 2018. We are pleased to report that to date MU2 has exhibited similar production characteristics to MU1. In addition, operational modifications have allowed for higher sustained production flows supporting efficient future wellfield operations as well as optimum recovery rates.\nOur Class V water system worked well throughout its first year of operations. This system is the first of its kind at an ISR uranium facility, having received all permitting and other authorizations at year-end 2016. Allowing for onsite disposal of fresh permeate (i.e., clean water) into shallow Class V wells, this system also permits us to recycle significant amounts of what would normally be considered waste water. Ultimately, the system reduces injection requirements in our Class I deep disposal wells and extends the life of those very valuable assets.\nGuidance for 2018\nFor 2018, we expect to deliver 470,000 pounds into our term contracts at an average price of approximately $49 per pound. We have scheduled 370,000 pounds to be delivered in Q1 2018. We will provide further guidance for 2018 production and other operational matters in our Annual Report on Form 10-K, which is currently anticipated to be filed on Friday, March 2, 2018.\nJanuary 19, 2018 Webcast\nA webcast and teleconference will be held on Friday, January 19, 2018 at 9:00 a.m. (MT) / 11:00 a.m. (ET) to provide an operational update and discuss current events in the uranium industry.

Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from any forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, fluctuations in commodity prices; capital and other costs varying significantly from estimates; failure to establish estimated resources and reserves; the grade and recovery of uranium which is mined varying from estimates; production rates, methods and amounts varying from estimates; delays in obtaining or failures to obtain required governmental, environmental or other project approvals; inflation; delays in development and other factors described in the public filings made by the Company at www.sedar.com and www.sec.gov.
