In other instances, the phones did not work at all.\n“Yesterday (Tuesday) everything remained stable,” the spokeswoman said, adding that with the cause of the disruption still unknown no “all clear” can yet be given to indicate that the situation is resolved.\nSwisscom is working with a software provider to get to the root of the problems, she said. Potential financial claims of customers will be governed by their contracts and handled individually.\n“Swisscom deeply regrets this incident,” it said in a statement.
