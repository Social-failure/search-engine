It has since then kept a slightly less sterling grade of AA+ on the world’s largest economy. Like Fitch, Moody’s Investors Service has maintained its top credit rating on the United States.\nReporting by Marc Jones, editing by Karin Strohecker\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-10T14:20:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-10T14:29:38.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
