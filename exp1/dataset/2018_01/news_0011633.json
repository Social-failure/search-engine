Chinese exports to the reclusive nation fell 23.4 percent to $260 million in the same period.\nFriday's trade data reflects cooling ties between Beijing and Pyongyang.\nAs North Korea's biggest trading partner and main source of aid, China holds influence over the pariah state. But bilateral ties, which date back to the Korean War, have weakened since North Korea began testing nuclear weapons in 2006 and Beijing has since joined the international community in supporting UN sanctions.\nRecently, under heavy pressure from Washington , the world's second-largest economy has been increasingly clamping down on its historical ally. Beijing has banned domestic lenders from doing business with North Korean clients in addition to halting certain exports in compliance with international sanctions\nâ€”CNBC's Nyshka Chandran contributed to this article.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-12T04:52:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-12T05:10:14.006+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
