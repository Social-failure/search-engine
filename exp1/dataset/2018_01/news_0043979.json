Syrian state media citing local sources as saying coalition air strikes had killed 15 civilians in the village, including seven women. \nAsked to comment, the coalition did not specifically say whether it had carried out the strike or not. It referred in an email to an earlier statement saying that coalition strikes had killed an estimated 145-150 Islamic State fighters in a command center near Shafah last Saturday.
