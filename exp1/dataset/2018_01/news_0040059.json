In the fourth quarter of 2017, a $15.6 million, or $0.09 per diluted share, charge to income tax expense was recorded related to the re-measurement of net deferred tax assets resulting from the new 21% federal corporate income tax rate established by the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act enacted in December 2017.\nThis press release features multimedia. View the full release here: http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180122006492/en/\n\"2017 was another solid year of performance for our organization as we generated positive operating leverage, and hit record levels in revenue and net income, excluding the tax charge,” said E. Phillip Wenger, Chairman and CEO. “I’m extremely proud of our team’s hard work this year, and continued focus on driving shareholder value. We look forward to 2018 and believe we are well-positioned for an even better year.”\nNet Interest Income and Margin\nNet interest income for the fourth quarter of 2017 increased $2.6 million, or 1.8%, from the third quarter of 2017. Net interest margin increased two basis points to 3.29% in the fourth quarter of 2017, from 3.27% in the third quarter of 2017. The average yield on interest-earning assets increased three basis points, while the average cost of interest-bearing liabilities increased one basis point. The three basis point increase in the average yield on interest-earning assets reflects a two basis point increase in loan yields and a six basis point increase in investment yields.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017, net interest income increased $54.6 million, or 10.5%, from 2016. Net interest margin increased ten basis points to 3.28%. The average yield on interest-earning assets increased thirteen basis points and the average cost of interest-bearing liabilities increased four basis points from 2016.\nBalance Sheet\nTotal average assets for the fourth quarter of 2017 were $20.1 billion, an increase of $199.9 million from the third quarter of 2017.

The allowance for credit losses as a percentage of non-performing loans was 131% at December 31, 2017, as compared to 128% at September 30, 2017 and 130% at December 31, 2016.\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2017, the Corporation recorded a $6.7 million provision for credit losses, compared to a $5.1 million provision for credit losses in the third quarter of 2017. For the year ended December 31, 2017, the provision for credit losses was $23.3 million, an increase of $10.1 million from 2016.\nNon-interest Income\nNon-interest income in the fourth quarter of 2017, excluding investment securities gains, increased $7.6 million, or 16.1%, in comparison to the third quarter of 2017. A $5.1 million net gain was recognized in the fourth quarter of 2017 upon the settlement of litigation. Other service charges and fees increased $1.6 million, or 12.9%, due primarily to increases in commercial loan interest rate swap fees and debit card income. Investment management and trust services income increased $1.0 million, or 8.2%. Also contributing to the increase in non-interest income were higher gains from the sales of Small Business Administration (SBA) loans. Slightly offsetting these increases was a seasonal decline in mortgage banking income.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017, non-interest income, excluding investment securities gains, increased $11.3 million, or 6.0%, primarily due to the $5.1 million net gain recognized upon the settlement of litigation in the fourth quarter of 2017 and increases in investment management and trust services income, SBA income, debit and credit card income and merchant fees.\nGains on sales of investment securities for the fourth quarter of 2017 were $1.9 million, a decrease of $2.7 million in comparison to the third quarter of 2017. In the fourth quarter of 2017, the corporation continued to recognize gains on the sales of financial institution common stocks, which totaled $6.4 million. The Corporation also repositioned its investment portfolio through the sale of certain debt securities, which resulted in total pre-tax net losses of approximately $4.5 million that partially offset these gains. For the year ended December 31, 2017, gains on sales of investment securities increased $6.5 million.\nNon-interest Expense\nNon-interest expense increased $6.3 million, or 4.8%, in the fourth quarter of 2017, compared to the third quarter of 2017. Included in other expenses in the fourth quarter of 2017 was a $3.4 million write-off of certain accumulated capital expenditures related to in-process technology initiatives in commercial banking due to a strategic shift to an alternative solution. Additionally, in the fourth quarter of 2017, the Corporation incurred approximately $1.0 million of costs related to defining requirements for, and selecting, the alternative technology solution, which was recorded in other outside services. Other increases occurred in salaries and employee benefits, net occupancy expense, FDIC insurance expense, and other real estate owned and repossession expense included in other expense.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017, non-interest expense increased $36.1 million, or 7.4%, compared to 2016. This increase was primarily due to the amortization of tax credit investments and increases in salaries and employee benefits, other outside services, state taxes, net occupancy expenses, software expenses and the aforementioned $3.4 million write-off.\nIncome Tax Expense\nThe effective income tax rate for the fourth quarter of 2017 was 44.4%, as compared to 20.5% for the third quarter of 2017. Excluding the $15.6 million charge related to the re-measurement of net deferred tax assets, the effective tax rate for the fourth quarter of 2017 would have been 18.9%. Based on the new corporate income tax rates effective January 1, 2018, the Corporation’s effective tax rate in 2018 and future years is expected to be substantially lower than in 2017 and in prior years.\nThe tax charge was estimated by the Corporation as of December 31, 2017 based on an initial analysis of the Act and may be adjusted in future periods following completion of the Corporation’s 2017 federal income tax return and evaluation of the effects, if any, of implementation guidance or regulations that may be issued by the Internal Revenue Service on the Corporation’s initial analysis of the Act.\nAdditional information on Fulton Financial Corporation is available on the Internet at www.fult.com .\nSafe Harbor Statement\nThis news release may contain forward-looking statements with respect to the Corporation’s financial condition, results of operations and business.

The Corporation has presented these non-GAAP financial measures because it believes that these measures provide useful and comparative information to assess trends in the Corporation's results of operations. Presentation of these non-GAAP financial measures is consistent with how the Corporation evaluates its performance internally and these non-GAAP financial measures are frequently used by securities analysts, investors and other interested parties in the evaluation of companies in the Corporation's industry. Management believes that these non-GAAP financial measures, in addition to GAAP measures, are also useful to investors to evaluate the Corporation's results. Investors should recognize that the Corporation's presentation of these non-GAAP financial measures might not be comparable to similarly-titled measures of other companies. These non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered a substitute for GAAP basis measures, and the Corporation strongly encourages a review of its condensed consolidated financial statements in their entirety.
