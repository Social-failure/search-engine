There are other ways it could work,” he added without specifying a way out of a deadlock ensuing from failure to seal a coalition deal.\nSPD leader Martin Schulz and other top SPD members on Friday urged members to endorse coalition talks with Merkel or risk facing new elections that could further damage the party.\nOpponents of the talks within the SPD, especially members of the party’s youth and left wings, are campaigning actively against further talks.\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron (R) greets German Chancellor Angela Merkel upon her arrival at the Elysee Palace in Paris, France, January 19, 2018. REUTERS/Charles Platiau Getting their way could lead to new elections or a minority government for the first time in Germany’s post-war era.\nMany experts fear that new elections could further strengthen the anti-immigrant, far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD), which entered parliament for the first time in September.\n‘STILL SUFFERING’\nRejection of the talks “would lead to new elections, and in pretty short order”, Schulz told weekly news magazine Der Spiegel. He said the SPD -- which posted its worst result since 1933 in the election -- was likely to see further losses.\nSlideshow (2 Images) “If the parties do not succeed in forming a government with the majorities in the Bundestag, then voters will punish them,” he told the magazine.\nThe leader of the SPD’s youth wing, Kevin Kuehnert, and other opponents of another coalition government, say a preliminary deal hammered out with conservatives falls too far short of SPD goals.\nSchulz and his backers insist the blueprint will benefit German citizens, and dampened hopes that formal coalition talks would result in significantly different results for the SPD.\n“The exploratory talks created a framework for what is possible and what isn‘t,” he said. “After all, we don’t want the other side to question things that we fought for and won.”\nRelated Coverage Merkel upbeat SPD will approve talks with her conservatives No catastrophe if Merkel fails to form coalition: Schaeuble Factbox: What happens if Germany's SPD refuse to hold talks with Merkel? A new poll by broadcaster ZDF showed that 64 percent of Germans -- and 75 percent of SPD members -- expect SPD delegates to approve further talks with the conservatives.\nThe SPD has vowed to ballot all of its 443,000 members on any final coalition deal with Merkel’s Christian Democrats (CDU) and their Christian Social Union (CSU) Bavarian allies.\nThe poll showed that only 45 percent of Germans were in favor of another grand coalition, although 68 percent of conservatives were in favor, and 57 percent of SPD members.\nConservatives would win 33 percent if the next election were held on Sunday, the poll showed, up one percentage point from a poll last week. The SPD would win just 20 percent of the vote, down three points from last week.\nAdditional reporting by Andrea Shalal and Thorsten Severin in Berlin; Writing by Joseph Nasr; editing by Ralph Boulton\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-19T16:10:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-19T16:22:06.016+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
