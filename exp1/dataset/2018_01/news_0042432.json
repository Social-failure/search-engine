Any purchases made under the NCIB will be made by Algoma subject to favourable market conditions at the prevailing market price at the time of acquisition through the facilities of the TSX and/or alternative Canadian trading systems.\nPursuant to the notice, during the twelve month period commencing January 29, 2018 and ending January 28, 2019, Algoma may purchase up to 1,927,615 of its Shares, representing approximately 5% of the 38,552,315 Shares that were issued and outstanding as of January 16, 2018. Under the NCIB, other than purchases made pursuant to block purchase exemptions, Algoma may purchase up to 1,838 Shares on the TSX during any trading day, which represents approximately 25% of the average daily trading volume of the Shares on the TSX for the past six calendar months, being 7,353 Shares. Any Shares purchased under the NCIB will be cancelled.\nAlthough Algoma intends to purchase Shares under its NCIB there can be no assurances that any such purchases will be completed.\nAbout Algoma Central Corporation\nAlgoma Central Corporation is a publicly traded company which operates the largest Canadian flag fleet of dry and liquid bulk carriers on the Great Lakes - St. Lawrence Waterway, including self-unloading dry-bulk carriers, gearless dry bulk carriers and product tankers.
