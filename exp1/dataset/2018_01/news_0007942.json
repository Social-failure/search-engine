He has said the firm needs external innovation to broaden its product line-up.\nUnder previous chief executive Lars Rebien Sorensen, Novo sat out a spate of deal-making across the drugs industry in recent years and instead focused on its market-leading position making insulin and other diabetes treatments.\nFILE PHOTO: The logo of Danish multinational pharmaceutical company Novo Nordisk is pictured on the facade of a production plant in Chartres, north-central France, April 21, 2016. REUTERS/Guillaume Souvant/Pool/File Photo But in March, the company approached Global Blood Therapeutics ( GBT.O ), a U.S. biotech company focused on serious blood disorders, to discuss a potential takeover, people familiar with the situation said.\nNovo Chief Financial Officer Jesper Brandgaard said the current bid could be revised if Ablynx agreed to engage in talks.\n“I think it would be natural to update the bid following a detailed discussion with the board of directors of Ablynx,” he told a conference call, adding that it would be premature to speculate on any subsequent raise.\nBrandgaard also played down the threat of an interloper, saying: “In terms of counter proposals it is not our understanding that any other bidder is pursuing the target.”\nABLYNX SHARES SUSPENDED Ablynx already rejected an offer by the Danish group on Dec. 14 and Novo Nordisk said the new bid, made on Dec. 22, was some 14 percent higher.\n“Novo Nordisk regrets that the board of directors of Ablynx has so far declined to engage in any discussions, despite the proposals which have been put forward,” it said in a statement.\nThe Belgian company had was not immediately available for comment on Monday. Belgium’s market regulator on Monday suspended Ablynx’s shares until further notice.\nAnalysts at Jefferies said they had a fair value of Ablynx at 29 euros per share, rising to 36 euros under a long term upside scenario.\n“We envisage Novo needing to hike the offer and could see counterbids,” the analysts said, adding that they see the latest offer as “a low-ball bid”.\nTax breaks and other incentives have created a thriving biotech industry in Belgium, with many companies spun off from university projects now listed on the local stock exchange.\nAblynx’s shares have almost doubled in price in the past 12 months, buoyed by successful clinical trial data. They closed at 21.20 euros on Friday.\nIts products, which are all still undergoing medical trials, target many different diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis, psoriasis or cancer.\n($1 = 0.8322 euros)\nAdditional reporting by Stine Jacobsen in Copenhagen, Ben Hirschler in London and Abinaya Vijayaraghavan in Bengaluru; Editing by Edmund Blair and Keith Weir\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-08T11:17:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-08T11:54:15.017+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
