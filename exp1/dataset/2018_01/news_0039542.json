The central bank has previously estimated the cost of PSB’s bailout at up to 200 billion roubles.\nThe Russian Finance Ministry said last week PSB would now be recapitalised and transferred to government ownership to service the defence sector as part of Russia’s efforts to shield its financial system from a further tightening of U.S. sanctions.\nThe ministry did not provide and estimate of the recapitalisation.\nPSB, which is currently controlled by the central bank under the terms of the bailout, has also written off five subordinated bond series worth $1.3 billion, the filings showed.\nThe move fits with previous rescue packages for Russian banks Otkritie and B&N Bank, which involved writing off some subordinated debt to reduce the amount the central bank needed to spend on the bailouts.\nThe PSB subordinated bonds which have been written off include issues maturing in 2019, 2021 , and two perpetual bond issues .
