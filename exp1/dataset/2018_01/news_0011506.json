The stock has lost 7.5 percent since Friday’s profit warning, with the shares hitting their lowest level in nearly two months. \nCryan, who consultancy HKP said earned 3.84 million euros ($4.6 million) in 2016, gave his most recent view on his tenure in a December interview with Boersen-Zeitung newspaper. \nAsked whether he wanted to extend his contract when it comes up for renewal in 2020, Cryan said: \n“I‘m doing well. I am healthy, and I hope for the bank useful. But my contract runs another 2.5 years. The question about how it goes after that hasn’t been posed.” \nDeutsche Bank declined to comment on Cryan’s future or the investor calls for a change in strategy. HARD SLOG IN STORE \nGermany’s biggest bank announced an overhaul in March last year that included integrating its Postbank retail bank with its in-house consumer bank in an effort to cut costs, as well as the partial sale of its asset management business. \nHowever, Cryan and his deputies have cautioned that the turnaround would be a long, hard slot. \nDespite the latest setback, others among Deutsche Bank’s largest investors are giving Cryan time, but prescribing fixes. \n“Cryan’s strategy as such isn’t in doubt - not yet,” said a person familiar with the thinking of the royal family of Qatar, which owns just under 10 percent of Deutsche Bank’s shares. \n“The problem appears limited to the U.S. investment bank,” said the person, speaking on condition of anonymity. \n“Deutsche Bank must take care of this quickly and, for example, find a strong personality who can take over the trading business there to revive it.” \nOther investors said they were closely watching the earnings of U.S. competitors to see whether the bank was closing the gap. \nDeutsche Bank said last week that revenue at its cash-generating bond-trading division was expected to drop 22 percent in the fourth quarter from a year ago. \nJPMorgan, the first major Wall Street firm due to report earnings, is due to do so on Friday, with analysts predicting a 15 percent slide in trading revenue at competitors. \n“We are keen to see how other investment banks have performed, but we suspect (weak performance) is something more Deutsche Bank specific,” Assenagon’s Huenseler said. \nRatings agency Standard & Poor‘s, which likens Deutsche Bank’ difficulty to turn around quickly to a supertanker, rates it at the bottom of its peers, with a negative outlook. \nA November report by S&P said the bank was focused on an “extended and far-reaching restructuring program; by contrast, many competitors are more focused on business as usual.” \nS&P said it would trim the bank’s rating by a notch if it “remains a relative underperformer in its core businesses.” \nDespite the bad news for investors, the prospects for some Deutsche Bank staff are looking better after Cryan promised to pay them bonuses in 2017, after virtually abolishing them for 2016.
