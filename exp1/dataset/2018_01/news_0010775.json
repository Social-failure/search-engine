They also cited trade tensions with the United States as a reason to slow Treasury purchases, the report said.\nTraders cited the report for a renewed rise in U.S. Treasury yields during European trade, with the U.S. 10-year bond yield rising to a new 10-month high at 2.593 percent. The U.S. dollar fell 0.6 against a basket of currencies for its biggest one-day drop in a month.
