Slideshow (26 Images) \nHarry, fifth-in-line to the throne, and actress Markle, best known for the TV legal drama “Suits”, are due to marry in May at Queen Elizabeth’s Windsor Castle home to the west of London. \n“They were lovely and they were shaking hands with everyone and Harry was just having a chat with everyone so it was really nice,” Angharad Akideinde, 18, told Reuters. \n“Because they are the younger generation they are more modern. It’s like the way they communicate with us as well. It is different to how the older ones would because they are more traditional I guess.” \nMarkle, who intends to become a British citizen, said after their engagement was announced that she was looking forward to getting to know her future homeland.
