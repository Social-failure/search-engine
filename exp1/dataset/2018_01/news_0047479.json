(NASDAQ:GNTY), the holding company for Guaranty Bank & Trust, N.A., today reported financial results for the fiscal quarter and year ended December 31, 2017. The company's net earnings for the quarter ended December 31, 2017, was $2.8 million, or $0.25 per basic share, compared to $3.6 million, or $0.40 per basic share, for the quarter ended December 31, 2016. The decrease in net earnings during the fourth quarter of 2017, compared to the same period in 2016, was primarily attributable to a one-time, non-cash charge to income tax provision of $1.7 million, or $0.17 per basic share, to reduce the value of our net deferred tax assets due to a tax rate reduction from 35% to 21%. The reduction in tax rate resulted from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 that was signed into law by President Trump on December 22, 2017. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2017, net earnings increased $2.3 million to $14.4 million from $12.1 million for the prior period. Basic earnings per share rose to $1.41 for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017 from $1.35 during the prior period. Net earnings for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017 before giving effect to the adjustment of our net deferred tax assets, was $16.1 million, compared to $12.1 million for the prior period, an increase in net earnings, before giving effect to the adjustment of our deferred tax assets, of $4.0 million, or 33.0%. The following table illustrates certain amounts and performance ratios before and after the effects of the one-time revaluation of our net deferred tax assets for the year ending December 31, 2017:\nBefore Deferred\nTax Asset\nAdjustment After Deferred\nTax Asset\nAdjustment Net earnings $ 16,134 $ 14,439 Return on average assets 0.85 % 0.76 % Return on average equity 8.70 7.78 Earnings per common share, basic $ 1.58 $ 1.41 Earnings per common share, diluted 1.56 1.40 The company's earnings per share and return on average equity were impacted by the issuance of 2,300,000 shares of common stock in the company's initial public offering, which closed in May 2017, as well as the additional one-time expense related to our deferred tax assets discussed above.\nNet interest income for the fourth quarter of 2017 and 2016 was $15.5 million and $14.0 million, respectively, an increase of 10.4%. Net interest margin for the fourth quarter of 2017 and 2016 was 3.39% and 3.32%, respectively. Net interest income and net interest margin, on a taxable equivalent basis, were $15.9 million and 3.48%, respectively, for the fourth quarter of 2017.\nThe provision for loan losses was $600,000 in the fourth quarter of 2017, compared to $800,000 in the third quarter of 2017 and $400,000 in the fourth quarter of 2016. The provision for loan losses in the fourth quarter of 2017 increased over the prior year's quarter primarily due to loan portfolio growth of 4.07% during the fourth quarter of 2017, along with net charge-offs of $269,000 for the quarter ended December 31, 2017, compared to net charge offs of $82,000 during the same period in 2016. The level of provision during the third quarter of 2017 is primarily attributable to specific reserves calculated for certain impaired loans and a slight increase in general reserves due to minor increases in some qualitative factors. Nonperforming assets as a percentage of total loans were 0.64% at December 31, 2017, compared to 0.78% at September 30, 2017, and 0.77% at December 31, 2016.\nNoninterest income increased 10.7% in the fourth quarter of 2017 to $3.8 million, compared to $3.4 million in the same quarter a year ago. Merchant and debit card fees increased 14.4% to $818,000, compared to $715,000 in the same quarter last year due to continued growth in net new accounts and debit cards. Fiduciary income increased 17.6% to $408,000 from $347,000 in the fourth quarter of 2016, primarily due to increases in the market values of assets under management, for which fee income is generally calculated as a percentage of the market value. Other categories of noninterest income increased with the continued growth of the bank.\nNoninterest expense for the fourth quarter of 2017 totaled $12.3 million, compared to $12.0 million for the fourth quarter of 2016, an increase of 1.9%. The increase in noninterest expense in the fourth quarter of 2017 was primarily driven by a $368,000 increase in salary and employee benefit expenses when compared to the same quarter a year ago, a $174,000 increase in occupancy expenses and a $54,000 increase in software and technology expenses. The increase was partially offset by decreases in FDIC insurance expense of $156,000 and other non-interest expenses of $161,000. The company's efficiency ratio in the fourth quarter of 2017 was 64.13%, compared to 69.04% in the same quarter last year.\nNet interest income increased $5.8 million to $59.6 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017 from $53.8 million during the prior period. The provision for loan losses totaled $2.9 million, compared to $3.6 million for the prior period. Noninterest income was $14.3 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017, compared to $13.0 million during the prior period. Noninterest expense was $48.4 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017, compared to $46.4 million during the prior period.\nAs of December 31, 2017, consolidated assets for the company totaled $2.0 billion, compared to $1.9 billion at September 30, 2017 and $1.8 billion at December 31, 2016. Loans totaled $1.4 billion at December 31, 2017, compared to loans of $1.3 billion at September 30, 2017 and $1.2 billion at December 31, 2016. Deposits totaled $1.7 billion at December 31, 2017, compared to $1.6 billion at September 30, 2017 and $1.6 billion at December 31, 2016. Shareholders' equity was to $207.3 million as of December 31, 2017, compared to $207.3 million at September 30, 2017 and $141.9 million at December 31, 2016. The increase from December 31, 2016 was primarily the result of operating earnings and the proceeds of the Company's initial public offering.\nThe company's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Ty Abston, said, \"We are pleased with our fourth quarter and year-end results. During 2017, we expanded into the growth markets of Austin and Fort Worth, Texas. Our other de novo and acquired locations in the Dallas/Fort Worth and Central Texas regions have continued to mature and, along with our legacy East Texas locations, provide value to our overall brand and footprint. We are very pleased with the successful execution of our strategies during the year and look forward to Guaranty’s continued future growth prospects.\"\nGuaranty Bancshares, Inc.

Accordingly, the shares of our common stock held by the KSOP while we were a private company are reflected in our consolidated balance sheet as a line item between total liabilities and shareholders’ equity. Upon listing of our common stock on the NASDAQ Global Select Market in May 2017, this repurchase obligation terminated and, consequently, we were no longer required to deduct KSOP-owned shares from shareholders’ equity.\n(2) See Reconciliation of non-GAAP Financial Measures table\n(3) The efficiency ratio was calculated by dividing total noninterest expense by net interest income plus noninterest income, excluding securities gains or losses.

We refer to these financial measures and ratios as “non-GAAP financial measures.” We consider the use of select non-GAAP financial measures and ratios to be useful for financial and operational decision making and useful in evaluating period-to-period comparisons. We believe that these non-GAAP financial measures provide meaningful supplemental information regarding our performance by excluding certain expenditures or assets that we believe are not indicative of our primary business operating results or by presenting certain metrics on a fully taxable equivalent basis. We believe that management and investors benefit from referring to these non-GAAP financial measures in assessing our performance and when planning, forecasting, analyzing and comparing past, present and future periods.\nThese non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered a substitute for financial information presented in accordance with GAAP and you should not rely on non-GAAP financial measures alone as measures of our performance. The non-GAAP financial measures we present may differ from non-GAAP financial measures used by our peers or other companies. We compensate for these limitations by providing the equivalent GAAP measures whenever we present the non-GAAP financial measures and by including a reconciliation of the impact of the components adjusted for in the non-GAAP financial measure so that both measures and the individual components may be considered when analyzing our performance.\nA reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures to the comparable GAAP financial measures is included at the end of the financial statement tables.\nAbout Guaranty Bancshares, Inc.\nGuaranty Bancshares, Inc. is a bank holding company that conducts commercial banking activities through its wholly-owned subsidiary, Guaranty Bank & Trust, N.A.

These forward-looking statements reflect our current views with respect to, among other things, future events and our results of operations, financial condition and financial performance. These statements are often, but not always, made through the use of words or phrases such as “may,” “should,” “could,” “predict,” “potential,” “believe,” “will likely result,” “expect,” “continue,” “will,” “anticipate,” “seek,” “estimate,” “intend,” “plan,” “projection,” “would” and “outlook,” or the negative version of those words or other comparable words of a future or forward-looking nature. These forward-looking statements are not historical facts, and are based on current expectations, estimates and projections about our industry, management’s beliefs and certain assumptions made by management, many of which, by their nature, are inherently uncertain and beyond our control. Accordingly, we caution you that any such forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and are subject to risks, assumptions and uncertainties that are difficult to predict.

Such factors include, without limitation, the “Risk Factors” referenced in our Registration Statement on Form S-1 filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), other risks and uncertainties listed from time to time in our reports and documents filed with the SEC, including our Annual Reports on Form 10-K and Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, and the following factors: business and economic conditions generally and in the financial services industry, nationally and within our current and future geographic market areas; economic, market, operational, liquidity, credit and interest rate risks associated with our business; the composition of our loan portfolio, including deteriorating asset quality and higher loan charge-offs; the laws and regulations applicable to our business; our ability to achieve organic loan and deposit growth and the composition of such growth; increased competition in the financial services industry, nationally, regionally or locally; our ability to maintain our historical earnings trends; our ability to raise additional capital to execute our business plan; acquisitions and integrations of acquired businesses; systems failures or interruptions involving our information technology and telecommunications systems or third-party servicers; the composition of our management team and our ability to attract and retain key personnel; the fiscal position of the U.S. federal government and the soundness of other financial institutions; and the amount of nonperforming and classified assets we hold. We can give no assurance that any goal or plan or expectation set forth in forward-looking statements can be achieved and readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on such statements. The forward-looking statements are made as of the date of this communication, and we do not intend, and assume no obligation, to update any forward-looking statement to reflect events or circumstances after the date on which the statement is made or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events or circumstances, except as required by applicable law.\nContact:\nCappy Payne\nSenior Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer\n(888) 572-9881\ninvestors@gnty.com\nSource:Guaranty Bancshares, Inc.", "external_links": ["https://www.globenewswire.com/NewsRoom/AttachmentNg/aefe4ce9-02dc-4276-bce3-31ea553c15f6"], "published": "2018-01-26T16:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-26T18:15:15.036+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
