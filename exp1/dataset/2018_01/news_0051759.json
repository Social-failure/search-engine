The firm has been embroiled in a governance crisis and has been at the heart of allegations of undue influence in awarding tenders during President Jacob Zuma’s time in power.\nInternational ratings agencies have regularly cited Eskom as a threat to South Africa’s strained public finances.\nEarlier this month the government named a new Eskom board and told the company to remove executives facing allegations of “serious corruption and other acts of impropriety”.
