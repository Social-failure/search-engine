It's important to note that Lutathera has not been approved for, nor shown to be effective in, patients with the more common form of pancreatic cancer, adenocarcinoma .\nEvery treatment available today was approved through a clinical trial. PanCAN strongly recommends clinical trials at diagnosis and during every treatment decision.\nLearn more about how clinical trials for drugs like Lutathera improve patient outcomes by contacting Patient Central or by visiting pancan.org .
