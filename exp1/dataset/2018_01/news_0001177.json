In the UK, the combined company produces these products in only two factories, Bridgwater (Refresco) and Nelson (Cott). Refresco, in consultation with Cott, is currently examining the details of the decision and is willing to offer suitable remedies and will fully cooperate with the CMA to address the concerns raised.\nCommenting on today's announcement, Jerry Fowden, Chief Executive Officer of Cott, said \"Other than the one product category produced by both Cott and Refresco, the CMA did not find any other competition concerns. With clearance already received from the U.S. and Canadian regulatory authorities, as well as overwhelming support from Refresco's shareholders, Refresco, in consultation with Cott, is willing to propose remedies to the CMA to address their concerns and work towards the successful completion of the acquisition.\"\nABOUT COTT CORPORATION\nCott is a route based service company with a leading volume-based national presence in the North America and European home and office bottled water delivery industry and a leader in custom coffee roasting, blending of iced tea, and extract solutions for the U.S. foodservice industry.
