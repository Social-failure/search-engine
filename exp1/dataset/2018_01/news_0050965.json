Buying some call options is most likely,” the source said, suggesting plans to hedge using futures contracts.\nThe holder of a call option has the discretion to assume a long position in crude futures at the strike price. Contracts are available for trading at derivative markets such as the New York Mercantile Exchange.\nAfter cumulatively easing its benchmark policy rate by 550 basis points last year, the central bank last week held the rate at 20 percent, citing emerging inflation pressures as global prices recover.\nGhana, which also exports cocoa and gold, is in its final year of a $918 million credit deal with the IMF to reduce budget deficit, public debt, inflation and stabilize its volatile local currency.
