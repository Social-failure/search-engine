The company took inspiration from Millennials' affinity for \"big... flavors in their favorite foods and beverages â€“ from hoppy craft beers to spicy sauces.\"\nThis move comes as Big Soda is criticized for contributing to Americans' unhealthy diets and rising obesity rates. A growing number of municipalities are instituting so-called soda taxes on sugary beverages.\nAnd in 2016, bottled water unseated carbonated soft drinks as Americans' favorite drink for the first time ever, according to Beverage Marketing, a research and consulting company. U.S. consumers bought 12.8 billion gallons of bottled water versus 12.4 billion gallons of carbonated soft drinks.\nFans of Diet Coke's existing cherry and lime flavors can still find them for sale online, according to the company.\n\"We wanted to take familiar flavors and shake them up. A lot. We want you to take that first sip and go: 'Dang, cherry and lime, you're all grown up!,'\" the Diet Coke website says, calling the newcomers \"bolder\" and \"a tasty twist on old favorites.\"\nLaunched in 1982, Diet Coke is now available in more than 110 markets around the world. The four new flavors will be introduced in Canada next month.\nCoca-Cola stock was $46.05, down 18 cents or 0.38%, in mid-morning trading.", "external_links": ["https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation-now/2017/04/21/diet-soda-can-increase-risk-dementia-and-stroke-study-finds/100736786/", "https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2018/01/09/mountain-dews-new-lemon-lime-flavor-takes-aim-sprite-7-up/1013756001/", "https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2017/10/25/coca-cola-zero-sugar-led-3-q-earnings-were-anything-but-zero/797747001/"], "published": "2018-01-10T20:32:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-11T02:15:38.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
