Several current CEOs spurned Neiman Marcus' approaches about taking its top spot, the paper reported. ( on.wsj.com/2Aor56f ) \nNeiman Marcus was not immediately available for comment. \nThe up-market chain has been struggling with a nearly $5 billion debt load mainly due to its leveraged buyout in 2013, when Ares and Canadian public pension fund CPPIB acquired it from other private equity firms. \nSeeking ways to cut debt, the retailer in March last year had explored options to change its capital structure or sell itself, but three months later abandoned that plan as its debt pile made any acquisition hard to structure. \nAt the time, the company had been in talks with Canadian retailer Hudson Bay Co for a full or partial sale, but those talks subsequently fell apart due to Neiman Marcusâ€™ high debt load.
