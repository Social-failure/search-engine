Carlson’s second-period goal goes down as the game-winner.\nBraden Holtby made 32 saves to earn the win, and Evgeny Kuznetsov, who left the game due to an unspecified injury, added two assists for Washington.\nFlorida’s Denis Malgin had the first two-goal game of his career. Malgin, 21, entered the game with no goals since Dec. 19.\nPanthers goalie Harri Sateri, who made 42 saves in just his fourth NHL appearance, has yet to win a game (0-3). Panthers first-string goalie Roberto Luongo and his main backup, James Reimer, are both out with right-leg injuries. Luongo is due back in early February, and Reimer will miss at least two weeks.\nFlorida led twice in the early stages of the game.\nWith 11:02 expired in the first period, Malgin opened the scoring. Jared McCann won a battle along the boards against Backstrom. Malgin found the loose puck and fired a shot that went through the legs of Washington’s Christian Djoos, beating Holtby to his stick side.\nThe Capitals evened the score with 17:25 gone in the first period, capitalizing on a holding call on Panthers defenseman MacKenzie Weegar. Ovechkin threaded a long pass to Kuznetsov, who connected with a streaking Backstrom, who flipped the puck just inside the left post.\nMalgin scored his second goal of the game with 6:40 expired in the second. Vincent Trocheck hustled to get the puck in the right corner, feeding Jonathan Huberdeau in the slot. Huberdeau shoveled the puck to his left to Malgin, who quickly converted.\nLess than two minutes later, Washington tied the score 2-2 when a wobbly shot by Brooks Orpik was deflected in off the stick of Ovechkin. The puck caromed off the left post and past Sateri.\nWith just 2:22 left in the second period, Carlson took a pass from Tom Wilson and roofed a one-timer past Sateri. Kuznetsov earned a secondary assist.\nWashington extended its lead to 4-2 on Connolly’s goal just 1:52 into the third period. He was set up by Andre Burakovsky’s speedy rush up the ice.\n--Field Level Media\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-01-26T11:42:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-26T21:32:35.018+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
