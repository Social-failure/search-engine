More than 3,000 are thought to have left to fight for jihadist groups in Syria, Iraq and Libya over the past years.\nReporting by Tarek Amara; editing by Alexander Smith\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-21T05:17:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-21T00:45:17.006+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
