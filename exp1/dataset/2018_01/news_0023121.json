Also Kier Group, which has a JV with Carillion on HS2 and the smart motorways programme, has said it does not expect to see an adverse financial impact from these JV contracts. Kier's shares are up 1.4 percent at a session high. Some analysts are not expecting a big impact on the sector, though. \"The impact will likely be small given the fragmented nature of the market,\" analysts at UBS say in a note. \"There is some risk of financial losses in joint ventures as well as the potential adverse financial impact on the supply chain which may impact others in the sector.\" (Kit Rees) EUROPEAN SNAPSHOT: EUROPE DIPS (0838 GMT) European shares are lower and don't seem set to join the global rally which has led Asian shares to hit historic highs on Monday after Wall Street extended its record-breaking run.
