Deposits were up $15.3 million (8.5%) to $194.6 million from December 31, 2016. Loans ended the year up 13.8% at $142.9 million compared to a year ago. Asset quality continues to be excellent as only . 05% of total assets are considered to be non-performing. By comparison, the average was .93% of total assets for the Bank’s national peer group, based on data provided as of September 30, 2017 (the most recent data available). Golden Valley continues to be a well-capitalized bank and far exceeds minimum regulatory requirements.\nNet income for the year was $1,985,307 ($0.95 per share) compared to $1,521,752 ($0.74 per share) for the year ended December 31, 2016 a 30.5% increase. Net income for the quarter ended December 31, 2017 was $583,838 ($0.28 per share) compared to net income of $218,514 ($0.11 per share) for the quarter ended December 31, 2016. Income from last year’s fourth quarter was affected by a one-time after-tax expense of $225,796 taken to voluntarily terminate an executive retirement plan. Without that expense, income for the fourth quarter of 2016 would have been $444,308 and $1,740,264 for the full year.\nFurther, the Bank’s Board of Directors declared a cash dividend for the fourth quarter of $0.05 per common share for stockholders of record as of January 5, 2018. The payment date for the dividend will be January 18, 2018.\nCommenting on the Bank’s financial results, Francis stated, “Our fourth quarter performance set a new record for quarterly earnings and contributed to our record annual earnings. While we are proud of our accomplishments this past year, we will create and take advantage of additional opportunities and continue to live up to our vision of being the ‘Best Bank in Town’ by delivering Absolutely Outstanding Customer Service. We will take this attitude to Redding later this spring as we open a full service branch there staffed with local bankers who know the community.”\nFrancis went on to say, “It is the people side of our business, our exceptional team of bankers and the relationships they’ve built that make our strong performance possible. They are passionate about community banking and sharing with others is what differentiates Golden Valley Bank from the competition.”\nGolden Valley Bank is a locally owned and operated commercial bank serving the needs of individuals and businesses in northern California.
