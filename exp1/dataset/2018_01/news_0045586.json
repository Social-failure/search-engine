Fourth quarter 2017 EPS from continuing operations was $1.35 compared to $1.87 in the fourth quarter 2016. Fourth quarter and full-year 2017 included an unfavorable $0.59 provisional tax-related impact due to the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017.\nIn addition, the company made a $1.0 billion pretax discretionary pension plan contribution in the fourth quarter 2017, which had an unfavorable tax-related EPS impact of $0.09 and was not included in the company's prior guidance. The company made a $500 million pretax discretionary pension plan contribution in the fourth quarter 2016, which had an unfavorable tax-related EPS impact of $0.04.\nNet sales in 2017 were $25.3 billion, up 5.1 percent compared to $24.1 billion in 2016. Full-year 2017 EPS from continuing operations was $6.94 compared to $7.55 for the full-year 2016.\n\"Raytheon delivered record sales and strong cash flow in 2017 reflecting the continued hard work and dedication of the Raytheon team,\" said Thomas A. Kennedy, Raytheon Chairman and CEO. \"Bookings strength across our broad portfolio of proven technology solutions positions the company well for the future.\"\nThe company generated strong operating cash flow for both the fourth quarter and full-year. Operating cash flow from continuing operations for the fourth quarter 2017 and full-year 2017 was $1.6 billion and $2.7 billion, respectively, after making the $1.0 billion pretax discretionary cash contribution to the company's pension plans. Operating cash flow from continuing operations for the fourth quarter 2016 and full-year 2016 was $1.1 billion and $2.9 billion, respectively, after making the $500 million pretax discretionary pension contribution. Operating cash flow in the fourth quarter and full-year 2017, excluding the $1.0 billion pretax discretionary pension contribution, was better than the company's prior guidance primarily due to favorable collections.\nIn the fourth quarter 2017, the company repurchased 0.5 million shares of common stock for $100 million. For the full-year 2017, the company repurchased 4.9 million shares of common stock for $800 million. Also, as previously announced in November 2017, the company's Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to an additional $2.0 billion of the company's outstanding common stock.\nThe company had bookings of $8.5 billion in the fourth quarter 2017, resulting in a book-to-bill ratio of 1.26. Fourth quarter 2016 bookings were $7.6 billion. Full-year 2017 bookings were $27.7 billion, resulting in a book-to-bill ratio of 1.09. Full-year 2016 bookings were $27.8 billion.\nSummary Financial Results\n4th Quarter\n%\nTwelve Months\n%\n($ in millions, except per share data)\n2017\n2016\nChange\n2017\n2016\nChange\nBookings\n$\n8,541\n$\n7,582\n12.6%\n$\n27,718\n$\n27,809\n-0.3%\nNet Sales\n$\n6,783\n$\n6,279\n8.0%\n$\n25,348\n$\n24,124\n5.1%\nIncome from Continuing Operations before Taxes\n$\n834\n$\n825\n1.1%\n$\n3,113\n$\n3,085 3\n0.9%\nFederal and Foreign Income Taxes\n$\n447 1\n$\n272 2\n64.3%\n$\n1,114 1\n$\n873 2\n27.6%\nIncome from Continuing Operations attributable to\nRaytheon Company\n$\n393 1\n$\n555 2\n-29.2%\n$\n2,022 1\n$\n2,243 2,3\n-9.9%\nEPS from Continuing Operations\n$\n1.35 1\n$\n1.87 2\n-27.8%\n$\n6.94 1\n$\n7.55 2,3\n-8.1%\nOperating Cash Flow from Continuing Operations\n$\n1,624\n$\n1,141\n$\n2,747\n$\n2,852\nWorkdays in Fiscal Reporting Calendar\n58\n57\n248\n249\n1 Fourth quarter and twelve months 2017 Federal and Foreign Income Taxes and Income from Continuing Operations attributable to Raytheon Company included: 1) a provisional tax-related expense of approximately $171 million due to the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, which had an EPS impact of $0.59, and 2) a $25 million unfavorable tax-related impact due to the $1.0 billion discretionary pension plan contribution, which had an EPS impact of $0.09.\n2 Fourth quarter and twelve months 2016 Federal and Foreign Income Taxes and Income from Continuing Operations attributable to Raytheon Company included a $13 million unfavorable tax-related impact due to the $0.5 billion discretionary pension plan contribution, which had an EPS impact of $0.04.\n3 Twelve months 2016 Income from Continuing Operations before Taxes and Income from Continuing Operations attributable to Raytheon Company included the tax-free gain of $158 million for the second quarter 2016 TRS transaction, which had a favorable EPS impact of $0.53.\nBacklog at the end of 2017 was $38.2 billion, an increase of approximately $1.5 billion or 4 percent compared to the end of 2016.\nBacklog\nPeriod Ending\n($ in millions)\n2017\n2016\nBacklog\n$\n38,210\n$\n36,709\nOutlook\nThe company has provided its financial outlook for 2018. Charts containing additional information on the company's 2018 outlook are available on the company's website.\nEffective January 1, 2018, the company adopted the new retirement benefit standard, which moves certain components of FAS pension and postretirement benefit expense from operating to non-operating income. The adoption of this standard increases operating income due to the removal of all components of FAS expense other than service cost, and decreases non-operating income by the same amount with no impact to net income. The standard does not impact our CAS expense, which is recorded in the results of each segment. As a result, our FAS/CAS Adjustment will be split into: FAS/CAS Operating Adjustment; and Other Pension Expense within non-operating. The 2017 Actuals - New Standard and the 2018 columns in the Financial Outlook table below reflect the adoption of the standard.\n2018 Financial Outlook\n2017 Actual\n2018\nAs Reported\nNew Standard 1\nOutlook 1\nNet Sales ($B)\n25.3\n25.3\n26.4 - 26.9\nDeferred Revenue Adjustment ($M) 2\n(35)\n(35)\n(10)\nAmortization of Acquired Intangibles ($M) 2\n(125)\n(125)\n(118)\nFAS/CAS Adjustment ($M)\n390\nn/a\nn/a\nFAS/CAS Operating Adjustment ($M)\nn/a\n1,303\n1,416\nOther Pension Expense, non-operating ($M)\nn/a\n(913)\n(958)\nInterest Expense, net ($M)\n(184)\n(184)\n(180) - (185)\nDiluted Shares (M)\n291\n291\n287 - 289\nEffective Tax Rate 3\n35.8%\n35.8%\n~19.0%\nEPS from Continuing Operations 3\n$6.94\n$6.94\n$9.55 - $9.75\nOperating Cash Flow from Continuing Operations ($B)\n2.7\n2.7\n3.6 - 4.0\nn/a = Not Applicable\n1 Effective January 1, 2018, the company adopted the new retirement benefit standard, Accounting Standards Update 2017-07.
