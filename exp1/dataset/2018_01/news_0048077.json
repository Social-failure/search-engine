It cost government-funded scientists $3 billion and 13 years of work. \nLoman said the mini-sequencer may soon allow genome mapping to become a routine part of medical care. \n“At the moment, sequencing is quite laborious and occurs in expensively equipped laboratories,” he said. “But in future, we can imagine sequencing using pocket-size devices in (doctors’) surgeries, in clinics and even in people’s own homes.” \nThe minION works by detecting the change in current flow as single molecules of DNA pass through a nanopore – or tiny hole – in a membrane. Mapping a human genome with this device costs around $1,000. \n“This is a landmark for genomics,” said Matt Loose of the University of Nottingham, who worked with Loman. “The long reads that are possible with nanopore sequencing will provide us with a much clearer picture of the overall structure and organization of the genome than ever before.” \nThe research was published on Monday in the journal Nature Biotechnology.
