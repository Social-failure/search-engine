These are nothing but the standard discussions we have with manufacturers,” executive vice president Francois Bastin said. \nIndustry sources say Airbus is evaluating the case for raising A320 production as high as 70 jets a month. \nThe industry is already accelerating at a record pace on the back of demand led by emerging markets, but engine makers have been particularly wary about overtaxing their suppliers. \nAir Lease Chairman Steven Udvar-Hazy told the Airline Economics conference in Dublin this week that current production plans were “realistic,” barring a setback in demand. \nCFM said it had received orders for 3,444 engines worth $46 billion at list prices in 2017, including 2,870 LEAP engines. \nIt has so far won orders or commitments for 14,270 LEAP.
