(OTC MARKETS:CSSI) Costas Inc. (CSSI or “the Company”) and its subsidiary AuthentaTrade Inc. (“AuthentaTrade”) are pleased to announce the Company has now placed the AuthentaTrade trade platform on “Amazon Web Services” to assist in the onboarding of its 75,000 KYC’d client list, acquired in the Company’s full acquisition of AuthentaTrade and its assets earlier this month. In addition, this robust and secure solution provided by the world’s largest cloud service provider will enable onboarding as many as 100,000 new clients per hour.\nThe upgrade to a cloud solution was needed to service the expected demand for AuthentaTrade’s anticipated launch mid March 2018. Costas, through AuthentaTrade, will now have the ability to support the onboarding of as many as 100,000 clients hourly. Based on the backlog of existing client account applications on several industry leading exchanges, AuthentaTrade has secured the infrastructure to capitalize on the flood of pending clients waiting to open accounts elsewhere. AuthentaTrade has also built out its own proprietary KYC verification system that starts by accepting a client’s credit card, by then verifying the identity of the applicant against a number of confidential parameters including past transactions, and by creating a Distributed Asset Technology style verification of a potential client’s previous activity. This provides a very robust and efficient onboarding process.\nAbout COSTAS (CSSI): http://www.otcmarkets.com/stock/CSSI/profile\nAuthentaTrade: http://authenta.trade/\nCOSTAS INC. is a publicly traded company on the OTC Markets under the symbol ‘CSSI’.
