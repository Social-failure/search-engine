Switzerland’s blue chip SMI index rose 0.4 percent to a record high, while Britain’s FTSE 100 jumped to another record.\nUK big caps were supported by a muted pound as big international health stocks and consumer staples added the most to gains. European autos was the top-gaining sector, up 1 percent, while almost every other sector traded in positive territory.\nAmong single stocks, Dialog Semiconductor saw its shares tumble 6.6 percent to the bottom of the STOXX after top customer Apple said that its products were hit by a chip flaw.\nReporting by Kit Rees; editing by Tom Pfeiffer\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-05T10:37:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-05T12:14:34.002+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
