Excluding tax benefit of 41 cents and charges of 24 cents, the custodian bank reported a profit of 91 cents, in-line with analysts’ expectation, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. \n“The impact of the lower tax rate would be almost entirely offset by actions that we will take to reinvest this benefit in our employees and our business,” Scharf said. \nBNY Mellon said net income applicable to common shareholders rose 37 percent to $1.13 billion, or $1.08 per share. [nPn3k9fw3a] \nOn an adjusted basis, the bank’s total revenue fell 1.8 percent to $3.72 billion. \nBNY Mellon’s non-interest expenses rose 14.25 percent to $3 billion. \nThe company’s assets under custody and administration rose 3.42 percent sequentially to $33.3 trillion as of Dec.31.
