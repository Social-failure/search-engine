Short positions on Pendragon have nearly trebled since the end of November, according to the FCA. UNSUSTAINABLE BOOM? \nAnother factor latched upon by the short-sellers is the threat to car finance packages that, thanks to a decade of cheap credit, now account for nearly 90 percent of new car purchases – nearly double the figure in 2006. \nUnder one of the most popular financing options, known as “personal contract plans” (PCPs), customers pay a small deposit to lease a car, making lower monthly payments than under a traditional hire-purchase scheme, with the option to return the car at the end of the contract. \nThe risk is that oversupply of used cars in the UK is about to hit the resale prices of cars on which PCP rates are partly based. PCP repayment rates would rise, further choking off demand for new vehicles and hitting dealer profit margins, which can already be as narrow as 2 percent. \nLookers and Pendragon derive the vast majority of their profits from the UK and Ireland, making them more exposed to a British downturn than the more geographically diverse auto manufacturers. \n“PCPs have been a big driver in pushing up the average price of a car,” Trium Capital’s Grewal said. “It allows you to afford a more expensive model.” \nLast month analysts at JP Morgan warned clients that PCPs had resulted in “unsustainably high volumes of premium vehicle sales”. \nFor the graphic 'Car dealers are suffering from falling sales', click - reut.rs/2CYVeMx Reporting by Alasdair Pal; Editing by Tom Pfeiffer and David Goodman", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-05T16:11:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-05T16:43:33.018+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
