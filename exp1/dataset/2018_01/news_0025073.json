Customer count fell about 4 percent over the last year.\n“Decisions that materially impact our employees are difficult but absolutely critical to securing the near-term health of the business while we build a great company that provides excellent opportunities in the future,” chief executive David Eckert, who took charge in September, said in a statement.
