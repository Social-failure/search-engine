But feeling good is not the same as being able to play matches and it will certainly take time before I reach that level.” \nHaving spent two frustrating years at Fenerbahce, Van Persie will hope to mimic the glorious return to Rotterdam of former national team mate Dirk Kuyt, who retired in May after securing Feyenoord’s first league title in 18 years. \nBut memories of that long-awaited trophy are fading fast, with Feyenoord already trailing league leaders PSV Eindhoven by 17 points halfway through the season.

REUTERS/Cris Toala Olivares \nFeyenoord clearly lacked offensive creativity in their 2-0 defeat against Ajax Amsterdam on Sunday, but Van Persie warned against too high hopes of his return. \n“I mainly hope to help younger players by setting an example, like experienced players such as (Dennis) Bergkamp, (Thierry) Henry and (Patrick) Vieira helped me at Arsenal,” Van Persie said of his expected role at Feyenoord.
