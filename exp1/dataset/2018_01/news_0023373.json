REUTERS/Jorge Silva \nThai barracks and government offices traditionally open their doors to children on the second Saturday of January, allowing kids to handle weapons. Children visiting Government House also got a chance to sit in the prime minister’s chair. \nThe 18 figures of the prime minister were set up around Government House. They show him in a variety of poses - including kicking a football and a boxing pose. \nPrayuth drew fire from rights groups this week when he jokingly set up one of the cardboard figures up in front of a microphone and told reporters that if they had questions they should “ask this guy”. Then he walked off. \nWansu Chai-aree, 14, is one of the many Thai teenagers who on Saturday posed for pictures with cutouts of the Prime Minister, who he refers to affectionately by his nickname “Tu”.

REUTERS/Jorge Silva \n“I would like uncle Tu to stay on to develop our country for as long as possible,” Wansu told Reuters. \nPrayuth, who seized power during turmoil in 2014, has been coy about his political future but has appeared keen to improve his public image amid growing suspicions that he plans to stay in power after the next election.
