Sadly, what that event showed is that there is still a lot more work for us to do.” FILE PHOTO: Britain's Prime Minister, Theresa May, joins Sutton and Cheam Member of Parliament (MP), Paul Scully, as he campaigns for the forthcoming London local elections, in south west London, Britain January 13, 2018.
