Washington made seven consecutive field goals, and a jumper by Wall pulled the Wizards within 63-59 with just under seven minutes left.\nOklahoma City regained control, and back-to-back 3-pointers by Raymond Felton helped the Thunder carry an 82-74 lead into to the final quarter. The Wizards would not go away, and a 3-pointer by Wall cut the margin to 88-85 with 8:23 left in the game.\nA jumper and demonstrative dunk by Westbrook gave Oklahoma City a 90-87 lead with just under eight minutes left. Westbrook continued to dominate, and his dunk off a steal by George gave the Thunder a 10-point lead and forced Washington to call a timeout with 6:41 left.\nFrom there, the Thunder were never threatened. A dunk by Anthony extended Oklahoma Cityâ€™s lead to 116-106 with just over a minute remaining.\nThe Wizards have allowed 98 or more points in 19 consecutive games. Washington also committed 23 turnovers, which led to 15 points for Oklahoma City.\nThe Thunder never trailed before the break, and Westbrook scored 15 points to help provide a 54-40 lead at halftime.
