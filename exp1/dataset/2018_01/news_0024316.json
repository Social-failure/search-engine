Czech Prime Minister Andrej Babis attends a parliamentary session during a confidence vote for the newly appointed government he leads, in Prague, Czech Republic January 10, 2018. REUTERS/David W Cerny \nPromises to spearhead a clean-up of Czech politics helped Babis’s ANO party win nearly 30 percent of the vote in a national election in October. \nBut he has become caught up in allegations he manipulated ownership of one of his companies a decade ago to win a 2-million-euro (£1.78 million) subsidy, mostly from European Union funds, meant for small businesses. He denies wrongdoing. \nBabis was investigated and charged with fraud before the election, but he retained immunity from prosecution after being re-elected. \nTuesday’s confidence vote was on a first attempt by Babis to form a single-party government. \nIt came after a parliamentary committee recommended that his immunity be lifted, making a vote by the full legislature - which if passed would trigger a reopening of the fraud probe against him - likely in coming days. \nThe ANO lacks a majority in the lower house, and the allegations against Babis have so far made other parties reluctant to support him in forming a viable government. \nBabis’ cabinet must now resign but will remain in office pending negotiations. President Milos Zeman, who appoints prime ministers, has told Babis he would give him another try at forming an administration. \nSeveral parties have signalled they might discuss governing with the ANO, especially if Babis himself was not prime minister, a condition he has so far refused to meet. \nBut parties may be tempted to reconsider by polls showing the ANO could score even better if fresh elections were called. \nBabis, the country’s second richest person, remains popular with his message to strengthen the Czech voice in the EU, digitise government and cut taxes resonating among voters. \nHe calls the police investigation, which also targets his wife and grown children, a ploy by adversaries to chase him out of politics, which many Czechs believe is ridden with bribery and favouritism.
