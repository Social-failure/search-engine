But it said tax authorities did not do enough to monitor businesses outside the financial sector used for money laundering, such as real estate.\nReporting by Anthony EspositoEditing by Chizu Nomiyama\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-01-04T00:23:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-03T19:36:57.019+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
