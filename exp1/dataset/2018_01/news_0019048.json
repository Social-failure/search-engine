That is the name under which it was admitted to the United Nations in 1993.\nThe two neighbours have agreed to form working groups led by foreign ministers to hold talks on a solution. They are hoping for progress in talks with a U.N. mediator on Jan. 17.\nGreek government officials have suggested that Athens would try to focus on brokering an agreement that calls for a compound name with a geographical qualifier.\nHowever, a nationwide survey conducted by Marc pollsters last week for the Proto Thema newspaper asked if Greece should agree on a compound name including the term “Macedonia”, with 68 percent repsonding “no” and 23.6 percent “yes”.\nGreeks are highly sensitive about the name issue and rallies are planned in Athens and in northern Greece in the coming weeks against any compromise that might retain the name Macedonia.\nMacedonia is also the name of Greece’s largest province and of the ancient northern Greek kingdom ruled by Alexander the Great.\nDeputy Foreign Minister George Katrougalos said on Sunday that the government was aiming for resolution to the name issue “with national unity”.\n“The solution that we will bring to parliament will be accepted not only by the two government partners but much more broadly,” he said.\nReporting by Karolina Tagaris; Editing by David Goodman\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-14T16:06:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-14T16:32:27.018+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
