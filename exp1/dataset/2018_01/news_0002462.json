It has also shut or curbed production at heavy industrial plants to limit smog build-ups.\nBut the city’s environment agency acknowledged that drier and windier weather conditions played a role in meeting air quality targets for the year, especially in the fourth quarter.\nThe government blamed bad weather for the near-record levels of smog last January and February, which saw PM2.5 readings spike by 26.7 percent in the key Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region in the first quarter of 2017.\nThe province of Hebei, which surrounds Beijing and is a major source of smog drifting over the capital, also saw PM2.5 concentrations decline 7.1 percent from a year ago to 65 micrograms in 2017, the province’s environmental protection bureau said on Tuesday.\nBut the region is still some distance away from meeting its official PM2.5 standard of 35 micrograms. The World Health Organization recommends levels of no more than 10 micrograms.\n“Current air pollutant levels remain a lot higher than the national air quality standard, indicating the improvement in air quality will still be a long-term process,” Beijing’s environment agency said.\nReporting by Muyu Xu in Beijing and David Stanway in Shanghai\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-03T11:20:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-03T11:35:30.018+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
