(Nasdaq:TSRI), a provider of computer programming consulting services, today announced financial results for the second quarter ended November 30, 2017.\nFor the quarter ended November 30, 2017, revenue increased 9.8% from the same quarter last year to $16.5 million. Net income attributable to TSR for the current quarter was $227,000 as compared to $126,000 in the prior year quarter. Additionally, net income per share for the current quarter was $0.12 compared to $0.06 per share in the prior year quarter.\nChristopher Hughes, CEO, stated, “Our revenue increased 9.8% for the second quarter reflecting revenue added primarily from providing an increased number of IT contractors to our clients. Although, gross profit as a percentage of revenue decreased, a decrease in selling, general and administrative expenses, along with the increased revenue, resulted in an increase in net income of $101,000 for the quarter.”\nCertain statements contained herein, including statements as to the Company’s plans, future prospects and future cash flow requirements are forward-looking statements, as defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.
