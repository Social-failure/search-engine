Two other men were injured in the attacks early on Wednesday.\nPolice said at the time of the arrest that terrorism was one line of enquiry they were pursuing.\n“At this time, we can find no established link to indicate that this tragedy is terrorist-related,” they said in a statement on Thursday. “However, enquires are continuing internationally as the investigation develops.”\nReporting by Padraic Halpin; editing by Stephen Addison\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-04T18:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-04T18:47:48.015+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
