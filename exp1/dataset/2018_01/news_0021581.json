In this role, she will help guide the Center's Women's Initiative (WIN) to address the shortage of women in the financial planning profession.\n\"Last year, we saw a record number of women earn CFP® certification, but the fact remains that women make up only 23 percent of CFP® professionals,\" said CFP Board Center for Financial Planning Executive Director Marilyn Mohrman-Gillis. \"Kathleen is a true expert on gender diversity in financial services and passionate about empowering more women to succeed in the financial planning profession. We are fortunate indeed to have someone with Kathleen's knowledge and commitment join the Center to advance programs and initiatives that will effect real change.\"\nMcQuiggan began her career at the financial services firm Alex Brown in Baltimore and later spent 13 years at Goldman Sachs, before departing in 2009 to focus on her passion – investing in women. She founded the consulting firm Catalina Leadership, where she began an engagement with Pax World Management and later joined the firm as Senior Vice President of Global Women's Strategies. In that role, she was responsible for product management of the Pax Ellevate Global Women's Index Fund and ran the firm's Women & Wealth practice management initiative. McQuiggan currently works at Artemis Financial Advisors.\nShe holds a B.S. from Towson University and is currently working toward becoming a CERTIFIED FINANCIAL PLANNER™ professional. A longtime advocate for advancing women in leadership, McQuiggan served on the CFP Board WIN Council since the initiative's inception in 2013.

In 2015, she was among 20 financial advisors and industry executives honored on InvestmentNews' inaugural \"Women to Watch\" list.\nMcQuiggan takes over the role of Special Adviser on Gender Diversity from Eleanor Blayney, CFP®, who recently established the Eleanor Blayney Gender Diversity Fund in concluding her official role with the Center.
