We're so very happy that she agreed with us,\" says Neal Hallford, writer and director of the episode as well as the co-Executive Producer of the series.\n\"I have searched the world near and far to tell magnificent stories.

I am so excited to be joining forces with Uncharted Regions!\" Edgley says of her casting. \"We can't wait to share this tale with you.\"\nPresented as a western set on Mars, the episode \"These Haunted Hills\" intentionally mixes the feel and trappings of both of classic westerns and of vintage sci-fi. \"Gigi has this remarkably expressive voice that uniquely bridges those separate worlds, and we are really looking forward to her breathing life into the world of New Perth,\" says co-Executive Producer Jana Hallford.\n\"These Haunted Hills\" is the fourth of thirteen episodes being produced for Uncharted Regions.
