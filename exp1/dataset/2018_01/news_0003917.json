His government has been criticized for failing to stem attacks by al Shabaab militants.\nForeign affairs minister Yusuf Garaad Omar, interior minister Abdi Farah Said Juha and the commerce and labor minister Khadra Ahmed Duale had been relieved of their duties, the information ministry said in a statement.\nThey were replaced with Ahmed Ise Awad, Mohamed Abdi Sabriye and Mohamed Abdi Hayir, in the foreign affairs, interior and commerce posts respectively.\nThere had been a “a dire need” to appoint new ministers to those posts, the statement said, adding the new cabinet members would help the government tackle its heavy workload.\nLast year, the defense minister and the head of military were sacked and replaced.\nThe head of national security and the police commander were sacked after the country’s deadliest truck bomb attack killed 512 people in October. Both posts have yet to be filled.\nWith the help of African troops, Somalia’s government has been battling the al Shabaab insurgents to try to restore peace in the country following decades of conflict.\nReporting by Abdi Sheikh; Writing by Duncan Miriri; Editing by Nick Macfie\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-04T08:31:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-04T08:52:47.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
