Market share in the United States is seen remaining stable year on year, it said. \nAhold Delhaize is facing tough competition from discounters Lidl and Aldi, while its online grocery delivery business, Peapod, must compete with Amazon after its acquisition of Whole Foods. \nOnline net sales rose 23.2 percent in the quarter at constant exchange rates and reached 2.8 billion euros for the full year 2017, it said in a statement. \nAhold Delhaize said in November, at the release of third-quarter results, that it was on track to meet its free cash flow goal of 1.6 billion euros for 2017 as cost savings for the year would be 250 million euros, better than the initial target of 220 million. \nCompany-compiled analyst consensus for fourth-quarter sales was 15.68 billion euros. \nThe company maintained full-year 2017 pro forma underlying operating margin guidance for the group of 3.9 percent.
