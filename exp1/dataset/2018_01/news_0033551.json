The farming association president Joachim Rukwied said glyphosate opponents were undertaking “a campaign of fear.” \nRukwied said opponents of glyphosate had failed to show scientific cause for concern. A ban would cause a massive competitive disadvantage to German farmers, who would face the extra costs of additional ploughing to control weeds, he said.
