From Monday to Wednesday, IMN members protested in the capital, with police arresting 52 people without specifying charges.\nIn 2016, Nigeria’s northern state of Kaduna declared IMN - a minority sect in the mainly Sunni Muslim north - unlawful on security grounds, angering its adherents as anyone convicted of being a member could be imprisoned for up to seven years.\nThe ban triggered a wave of attacks on IMN members, worsening sectarian rivalries in northern Nigeria, where the army is also fighting Boko Haram, Sunni Islamist militants who have killed tens of thousands and caused a humanitarian crisis.\nSecurity analysts have drawn parallels between the Shi‘ite group and Boko Haram, whose insurgency began in 2009 after security forces killed hundreds of its members and its leader Mohammed Yusuf died in custody. Zakzaky was badly wounded in the 2015 clashes.\nNigeria, with a population of 190 million, combines a predominantly Christian south and mainly Sunni Muslim north. Shi‘ites are estimated at less than 4 million, although there are no official figures. Human Rights Watch estimates that IMN has around 3 million members.\nIMN was founded in the 1980s after an Islamic revolution in mainly Shi‘ite Iran in 1979, which inspired the sect’s founders.\nReporting by Paul Carsten; Additional reporting by Alexis Akwagyiram in Lagos; Editing by Ros Russell\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-13T19:46:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-13T20:20:13.058+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
