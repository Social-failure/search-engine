U.S. indexes barely moved on Monday as investors took a breather ahead of earnings season and after a strong start to 2018. The Australian local share price index futures rose 0.1 percent or 8 points to 6,089, a 41.4-point discount to the underlying S&P/ASX 200 index close. The benchmark rose 0.1 percent to close at a 10-year high on Monday. New Zealand's benchmark S&P/NZX 50 index rose 0.1 percent in early trade.
