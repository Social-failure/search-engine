Average asking rents fell less than 1 percent to $72.25 a square foot from the fourth quarter of 2016, but rents for new Class A construction rose to more than $100 a square foot.\nManhattan office leasing activity increased 16 percent last year from 2016, with 30.5 million square feet of new leases signed, which marked the second-highest level in 17 years.\nReporting by Herbert Lash; Editing by Daniel Bases and Lisa Shumaker\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-10T22:11:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-10T22:24:30.009+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
