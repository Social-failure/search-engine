Cricket - India v South Africa - Third Test match - The Wanderers Stadium, Johannesburg, South Africa - January 25, 2018. South Africa's Hashim Amla avoids a bouncer. REUTERS/James Oatway \nCaptain Faf du Plessis (8) also misjudged a seaming delivery from Jasprit Bumrah (2-34) as he left a ball that cannoned into the top of off-stump. \nSouth Africa looked to hit their way out of trouble, but Quinton de Kock’s (8) poor series continued when he tried to attack the bowling, only succeeding in getting a thick inside edge off Bumrah that was easily taken by wicketkeeper Parthiv Patel. Slideshow (4 Images) \nApart from Amla, none of the frontline batsmen showed the same circumspection as nightwatchman Kagiso Rabada (30), who batted for over two hours to frustrate the India bowlers in the morning session before he was out five minutes before lunch. \nRabada had played some superb shots before edging Ishant Sharma (1-28) to Ajinkya Rahane at third slip. \nIndia had been dismissed for 187 on the opening day.
