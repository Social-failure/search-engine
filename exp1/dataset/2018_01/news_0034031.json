So we told them that this is not acceptable with our side,” the state-run Ethiopian News Agency Quote: d Hailemariam as saying.\nThe agency, which spoke to Hailemariam upon his return from Cairo on Friday, said he rejected the proposal and said: “It is possible to reach agreement ... through cooperation and with the spirit of trust”.\nAfter his meeting with the Ethiopian leader, Egypt’s President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi pledged not to let differences over a construction of the dam ruin relations with Addis Ababa.\nCountries that share the river have argued over the use of its waters for decades - and analysts have repeatedly warned that the disputes could eventually boil over into conflict.\nAmong the questions Ethiopia and Egypt disagree about is the speed at which the dam’s reservoir would be filled.\nThe Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam - now 60 percent complete - will churn out 6,000 MW upon completion.\nIt is among an array of projects being built. Under a new 2015-2020 development plan, Addis Ababa wants to raise power generation to 17,346 MW from a current capacity of just over 4,300 MW from hydropower, wind and geothermal sources.\nReporting by Aaron Maasho; Editing by Elias Biryabarema, William Maclean\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-01-22T00:55:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-22T05:54:35.007+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
