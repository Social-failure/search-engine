The rial traded for 440 to the dollar by year’s end and this week crashed to around 500. \n“Government action in this regard is done on several tracks, according to the limited options available, including intensifying communication ... to expedite the completion of the Saudi depository procedures,” state news agency Saba quoted government spokesman Rajeh Badi as saying on Monday. \nSaudi officials did not immediately respond to a request for comment about the allegedly promised funds. \nPresident Hadi announced on Nov. 11 that Riyadh had agreed to deposit $2 billion into Yemen’s central bank to shore up the rial and secure shipments of badly needed fuel. \nHadi’s government moved the central bank in 2016 from the Houthi-controlled capital Sanaa to the southern port city of Aden, where the government is currently based. \nBoth the central bank in Aden and the one in Sanaa suffer from depleted reserves, but they have played a key role in mitigating widespread economic pain by paying some public sector salaries, as soaring prices threaten to push basic commodities out of reach for many Yemenis. \nThe Aden authorities accuse the Houthis of plundering the bank’s foreign reserves to fund their war effort when it was based in the capital, charges the group and the Sanaa bank deny.
