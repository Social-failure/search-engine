They have presented a united front and vested their representatives in Brussels with the authority to negotiate with London. \nHammond sought to hammer home his message in a speech he was due to give later on Wednesday in Berlin. \n“They say ‘it takes two to tango’: both sides need to be clear about what they want from a future relationship,” Hammond said, according to excerpts of the speech.

But they argued that in building a new relationship negotiators should not restrict themselves to models that already exist.
