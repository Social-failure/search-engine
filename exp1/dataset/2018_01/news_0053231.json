However, his overtures were rebuffed by investors. \nShaftesbury, which owns and manages properties around the affluent West End shopping district, had in November reported higher full-year net asset value, saying that demand and rents were holding up despite Brexit uncertainty. \nThe group has a market valuation of 3.12 billion pounds. It is slated to hold its general meeting on Feb. 9.
