Statements preceded by, followed by or that otherwise include the words “believes,” “expects,” “anticipates,” “intends,” “projects,” “estimates,” “plans” and similar expressions or future or conditional verbs such as “will,” “should,” “would,” “may” and “could” are generally forward-looking in nature and not historical facts, although not all forward-looking statements include the foregoing words. Forward-looking statements include information concerning Allegiance’s future financial performance, business and growth strategy, projected plans and objectives, as well as projections of macroeconomic and industry trends, which are inherently unreliable due to the multiple factors that impact economic trends, and any such variations may be material. Such forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and are subject to risks and uncertainties, many of which are outside of Allegiance’s control, which may cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied by the forward-looking statements. These risks and uncertainties include but are not limited to whether Allegiance can: continue to develop and maintain new and existing customer and community relationships; successfully implement its growth strategy, including identifying suitable acquisition targets and integrating the businesses of acquired companies and banks; continue to sustain its current internal growth rate; provide quality and competitive products and services that appeal to its customers; continue to have access to debt and equity capital markets; and achieve its performance objectives. These and various other risk factors are discussed in Allegiance’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2016 and in other reports and statements Allegiance has filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Copies of such filings are available for download free of charge from the Investor Relations section of Allegiance’s website at www.allegiancebank.com , under Financial Information, SEC Filings. Any forward-looking statement made by Allegiance in this release speaks only as of the date on which it is made. Factors or events that could cause Allegiance’s actual results to differ may emerge from time to time, and it is not possible for Allegiance to predict all of them. Allegiance undertakes no obligation to publicly update any forward-looking statement, whether as a result of new information, future developments or otherwise, except as may be required by law.\nAllegiance Bancshares, Inc.\n8847 West Sam Houston Parkway N., Suite 200\nHouston, Texas 77040\nir@allegiancebank.com\nSource:Allegiance Bancshares, Inc.", "external_links": ["https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=BluFH8eMu0uEmCSL5M3ZnF0kq9neX5j9OnMwIk1ylM3nvVnWjuCG0qiZy5kItgHpYRGr3bLI54Nb76a9Zq1-RwAbmQaJQEq_UkqjuieWHlg=", "https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=BluFH8eMu0uEmCSL5M3ZnF0kq9neX5j9OnMwIk1ylM3JJq15ZrmpuJFrYlkDCcYaxweGnIfglH9P0OIlIsmqiT1F4wb12fWgpYc44PZ1cos=", "https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=BluFH8eMu0uEmCSL5M3ZnF0kq9neX5j9OnMwIk1ylM1X-TROPBBswEnHdeNmjlmUAO70ayAtDnH2s5q2-ArGPIJwcvapauI5ukOvZWWSark=", "https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=BluFH8eMu0uEmCSL5M3ZnF0kq9neX5j9OnMwIk1ylM1aZLare_PNAlYbsavlz7HWCmPlnZK4TPmhBTr3QG2PlfHvOrKoSPFuAZ41NbZkEr8=", "https://www.globenewswire.com/NewsRoom/AttachmentNg/0decac7e-dbe7-48f0-85f7-5af335abb00c", "https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=BluFH8eMu0uEmCSL5M3ZnF0kq9neX5j9OnMwIk1ylM0Wkg8NvTdXfJvFQxv5WVL16OtoeKGXsi5__1mbjvfJCS6-cdSeqX9o2CE3T4SLcOs=", "https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=7DNzQfLzVHtVkWP63s6iD8EUXtDmktfYQv_LPzIvAwKEPx8XtW2I2WKAESmH9zsu03pNe3XfnAl1L0aEoGN96Qa0SQ6uGkmikkPqIvMEoV8="], "published": "2018-01-12T01:39:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-12T01:59:10.013+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
