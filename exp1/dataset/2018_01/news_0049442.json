Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, presidential pre-candidate of the National Regeneration Movement (MORENA), waves as he leaves an event during which he unveiled his anti-corruption plan he will put in place if he wins this year's election, in Mexico City, Mexico January 29, 2018. REUTERS/Carlos Jasso \nLate last year, a group of opposition senators put forth a similar proposal. \nLopez Obrador is running a campaign based on fighting entrenched corruption and he has consolidated support, a poll showed Monday. However, the race has tightened as another opposition contender gained ground while the ruling party hopeful trailed. \nThe ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI) has been hit by graft scandals and allegations of conflict of interest surrounding President Enrique Pena Nieto and several top aides. \nLopez Obrador said he would propose three candidates for congressional approval to take over the position as attorney general: judges Eva De Gyves Zarate and Juan Luis Gonzalez Alcantara and lawyer Bernardo Batiz, who served as the capital’s attorney general when Lopez Obrador was mayor. \nHe said he would not lobby in favor of any of the three and would leave the decision to lawmakers, if he wins the election. He also put forward candidates to take over as top electoral crimes prosecutor and a newly created anti-corruption post.
