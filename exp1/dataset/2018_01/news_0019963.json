Flowers - which owns 5 percent of HSH - and Cerberus have submitted a joint bid with a headline price of more than 700 million euros ($849 million), one of the people said, adding it remained unclear what conditions were attached to the offer. \nA rival bid from Apollo was seen as giving the bank a roughly similar valuation, the people said. \nHSH, its owners and the bidders, declined to comment or were not immediately available for comment. \nHSH became the world’s largest lender to the shipping industry in the 2000s but after a sector slump it required a state rescue and is now majority-owned by the states of Schleswig-Holstein and Hamburg. \nHamburg and Schleswig-Holstein are set on Monday to discuss the next steps in the privatisation, which needs to be finalised by the end of February following European Union state-aid rules. \nWhile a sale of only parts of HSH is an option, HSH’s state owners are not allowed to absorb any losses if they wind down assets on their own. \nLike its peers, HSH has benefited from first signs of recovery in the shipping market in recent months. \nBloomberg earlier reported that the bid of J.C. Flowers and Cerberus had 700 million euro a price tag.
