It is to update its estimates for all the countries it tracks on Jan. 22.\nAsked if the IMF was likely to upgrade its forecasts for major economies more broadly, he said he was optimistic.\nReporting by Leigh Thomas; editing by Richard Lough and John Stonestreet\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-01-09T01:28:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-09T17:18:38.072+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
