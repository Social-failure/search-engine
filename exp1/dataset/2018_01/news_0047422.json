The dollar index has slid more than three percent so far in January and is set for its biggest monthly drop since March 2016.\nSome market participants are also concerned that Trump may encourage more protectionist policies at a speech in Davos around 1300 GMT and at a State of the Union speech next week, policies that may ultimately end up pushing the dollar lower.\nAgainst the euro, the dollar’s weakness was the most apparent, with the single currency up half a percent at $1.2465 and not far away from a December 2014 high of above $1.25 hit on Thursday.\nWith European Central Bank President Mario Draghi declining to lean against the recent euro rally and instead signaling that economic data pointed to “solid and broad” growth, investors were encouraged to push the currency higher.\nDraghi also warned that the surge in the euro was a source of uncertainty and said the ECB might have to review strategy if U.S. comments on the benefits of a weak dollar lead to a change in monetary conditions.\n“Draghi’s reluctance to offer any resistance to the euro means that euro/dollar is only set to rise more in the coming months,” said Manuel Oliveri, an FX strategist at Credit Agricole in London.\nSterling rose 0.4 percent to $1.4191, but remained well below its peak on Thursday of $1.4346, which was the pound’s highest level since the Brexit vote in June 2016 as some investors turned bullish on the currency’s outlook.\nAgainst the yen, the dollar held steady at 109.42 yen , staying above a four-month low of 108.50 yen struck on Thursday.\nAsked about the comments on the dollar by Trump and Mnuchin, Japanese Finance Minister Taro Aso said on Friday that major economies have agreed to avoid targeting currencies for the purpose of trade competitiveness.\nFor Reuters Live Markets blog on European and UK stock markets see reuters://realtime/verb=Open/url=http://emea1.apps.cp.extranet.thomsonreuters.biz/cms/?pageId=livemarkets (Reporting by Saikat Chatterjee, Editing by William Maclean)\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.", "external_links": ["http://emea1.apps.cp.extranet.thomsonreuters.biz/cms/?pageId=livemarkets", "http://tmsnrt.rs/2egbfVh", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-01-26T17:06:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-27T00:16:29.005+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
