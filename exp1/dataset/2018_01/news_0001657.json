Allergan currently employs 18,000 people, according to its website.\nIn November, the company said it was working on a program to expand its base business and reduce costs so it could return to earnings growth by 2019, but did not disclose a specific strategy at that point.\nAllergan worked hard in recent years to protect Restasis, which generated about $1.5 billion in sales in 2016, from generic rivals. It struck a controversial deal with a Native American tribe in September to shield review of the patents by U.S. regulators, drawing the ire of lawmakers and rival drug companies.\nBut in October, a Texas federal judge invalidated Restasis patents on grounds that they cover ideas that are obvious, making it possible for rival generics to hit the market as early as next year. Allergan has appealed the ruling.\nShares of Allergan rose $1.45, or 0.9 percent, to $171.77 in midday trading on Wednesday.
