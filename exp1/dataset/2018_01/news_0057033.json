It said 468 employees would be affected at the eight stores proposed for closure and will now enter a period of consultation. \nM&S, which earlier this month disappointed investors with its Christmas trading update, has also reassessed and reduced the opening program for its “Simply Food” stores, and now only plans to open a total of 36 owned or franchised stores over the next six months. It said these stores would create 1,200 jobs. \nGuidance in November was for about 80 Simply Food store openings in 2017-18, around 10 fewer than previously planned. \n“We believe these changes are vital for the future of M&S and we will continue to accelerate the program,” said director of retail Sacha Berendji. \nShares in M&S, down 10 percent over the last year, were down 1.1 percent at 1024 GMT. \nM&S currently has 1,025 stores in the UK -- 302 clothing, home and food, 684 food-only and 39 outlets.
