(\"The Bancorp\") (NASDAQ: TBBK), a financial holding company, today reported financial results for the fourth quarter and full year 2017.\nHighlights\nFourth quarter and full year pre tax income of $10.2 million and $40.4 million, respectively, from continuing operations Net interest income increased 7% to $26.7 million for the quarter ended December 31, 2017, compared to $25.0 million for the quarter ended December 31, 2016. Net interest margin increased to 3.11% for the quarter ended December 31, 2017, compared to 2.84% for the quarter ended December 31, 2016. Prepaid fees for the quarter ended December 31, 2017 increased to $14.1 million, or 18%, compared to fourth quarter 2016. Loans increased 14% to $1.39 billion at December 31, 2017, compared to $1.22 billion at December 31, 2016. Security backed lines of credit (“SBLOC”) increased 16% to $730.5 million at December 31, 2017, compared to $630.4 million at December 31, 2016. Direct lease financing increased 9% to $378.0 million at December 31, 2017 compared to $346.6 million at December 31, 2016. Small Business Administration (“SBA”) loans increased 9% to $401.9 million at December 31, 2017, compared to $369.8 million at December 31, 2016. The rate on average deposits and interest bearing liabilities of $3.71 billion in the fourth quarter of 2017 was 0.45% with a rate of 0.56% for $2.05 billion of average prepaid card deposits. Assets held for sale from discontinued operations decreased 16% to $304.2 million at December 31, 2017, compared to $360.7 million at December 31, 2016. Consolidated leverage ratio was 7.9% at December 31, 2017, after the deferred tax adjustment relating to the tax reform reduction in the corporate tax rate. Book value per common share at December 31, 2017 was $5.81 per share. The Bancorp and its subsidiary, The Bancorp Bank, remain well capitalized.\nDamian Kozlowski, The Bancorp’s Chief Executive Officer, said, “2017 was a year of accomplishments and transition for The Bancorp. We made significant progress in reducing the risk of the institution and greatly enhancing productivity and efficiency while setting the necessary conditions for future success.”\nWhile fourth quarter income before tax for continuing operations amounted to $10.2 million, a fourth quarter 2017 loss resulted from an additional tax provision of approximately $18 million resulting from the legislative change in tax rates applied to deferred tax assets. While the statutory federal rate was reduced from 34% to 21%, which reduced the carrying value of deferred tax assets, future income will be taxed at the 21% rate. The Bancorp reported net loss of $12.4 million, or $0.22 loss per diluted share, for the quarter ended December 31, 2017, compared to a net loss of $28.7 million, or $0.52 loss per diluted share for the quarter ended December 31, 2016. For full year 2017, Bancorp reported net income of $21.7 million, or $0.39 earnings per diluted share, compared to a net loss of $96.5 million, or $2.17 loss per diluted share, in full year 2016. The impact of deferred tax adjustments which reduced net income in 2017 is shown in the footnotes for return on assets and return on equity in the table section of this release. Income from continuing operations does not include any income which may result from the reinvestment of the proceeds from sales or repayment of the remaining assets in The Bancorp’s discontinued operations. Tier one capital to assets, tier one capital to risk-weighted assets, total capital to risk-weighted assets and common equity-tier 1 ratios were 7.90%, 16.75%, 17.11% and 16.75%, respectively, compared to well capitalized minimums of 5%, 8%, 10% and 6.5%, respectively. In connection with the pending sale of a Florida mall property, a charge of $3.0 million was recorded in discontinued operations in the fourth quarter of 2017. The following is a reconciliation of pre tax income to adjusted operating earnings, a non-GAAP measure which reflects the financial impact of that charge:\nThree months ended December 31, 2017 (in thousands) Pretax income (loss): Continuing operations $ 10,181 Discontinued operations (1,429 ) Total 8,752 Add back: Loss on mall 3,000 Pretax income excluding loss on mall (1) $ 11,752 (1) As a supplement to GAAP, Bancorp has provided this non-GAAP performance measure. Bancorp believes that this non-GAAP financial measure is useful because it allows investors to assess its operating performance. Management utilizes adjusted operating earnings to measure the combined impact of changes in net interest income, non-interest income and certain other expenses. Other companies may calculate adjusted operating earnings differently. Although this non-GAAP financial measure is intended to enhance investors’ understanding of Bancorp’s business and performance, it should not be considered, and is not intended to be, a substitute for net income calculated pursuant to GAAP.

Bancorp believes that this non-GAAP financial measure is useful because it allows investors to assess its operating performance. Management utilizes adjusted operating earnings to measure the combined impact of changes in net interest income, non-interest income and certain other expenses. Other companies may calculate adjusted operating earnings differently. Although this non-GAAP financial measure is intended to enhance investors’ understanding of Bancorp’s business and performance, it should not be considered, and is not intended to be, a substitute for net income calculated pursuant to GAAP.
