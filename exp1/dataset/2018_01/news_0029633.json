Trump wants it strengthened with a separate agreement within 120 days.\n“This agreement cannot be implemented if one of the participants unilaterally steps out of it. It will fall apart, there will be no deal then,” Lavrov told reporters at the United Nations in New York.\nLavrov said he believed the United States was “going to try to convince the European states to take the same position that Washington has taken.”\nMost U.N. and Western sanctions on Iran were lifted two years ago under the 2015 nuclear deal between Tehran and key world powers, which is enshrined in a United Nations Security Council resolution.\n“It cannot keep alive in a re-negotiated form, especially regarding the demands by the United States. It would not be acceptable for Iran and it is clear now, I believe, that the Europeans do understand this danger right now,” Lavrov said.\nIranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif has said the deal was not renegotiable.\nReporting by Michelle Nichols; Editing by James Dalgleish\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-19T21:51:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-19T22:04:40.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
