Long may this continue”, said Accendo Markets analyst Mike van Dulken. \nTroubled building and services group Carillion lost about 1 percent after asking creditors to consider a debt extension or roll-over in financing talks. \n“We suspect that given its mounting liabilities, recent press comment, growing customer worries and supply chain hesitancy that Carillion will be forced (by the banks) to accelerate its financial restructuring”, Peel Hunt analyst Andrew Nussey said. \nWhile Christmas updates weighed on Tesco and Marks and Spencer during the previous session, the latter recovered slightly, up 1.5 percent. \nOil prices, which slipped from 2014 highs, weighed on BP and Royal Dutch Shell which retreated 0.5 percent and 0.6 percent.
