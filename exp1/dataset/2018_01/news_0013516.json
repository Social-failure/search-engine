I have a theory that bitcoin is very different than what people think. People think that it is tremendously safe and anonymous and get can’t be hacked and all that stuff. I have feeling that it is the opposite. \n“I do not own bitcoin. This type of investment is very, very different from my conservative DNA,” Gundlach said.
