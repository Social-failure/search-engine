(the “Company”) (NASDAQ:NFBK) , the holding company for Northfield Bank, reported a loss per common share of $0.04 for the quarter ended December 31, 2017 and diluted earnings per common share of $0.53 for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to diluted earnings per common share of $0.18 and $0.57 for the quarter and year ended December 31, 2016, respectively. Earnings for the quarter and year ended December 31, 2017, include an estimated tax charge of $10.5 million, or $0.23 per diluted share, related to the recently enacted federal tax reform (the “Tax Reform Act”). Beginning in 2018, the Tax Reform Act, among other things, reduces the federal corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21%. As a result of the lower corporate tax rate, during the fourth quarter of 2017, the Company recorded an adjustment of $10.5 million to reduce its net deferred tax assets, with a corresponding charge to income tax expense. In addition, earnings for the year ended December 31, 2017, were also affected by the adoption of Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-09, Compensation - Stock Compensation (Topic 718) (“ASU 2016-09”), which resulted in a $2.3 million, or $0.05 per diluted share, reduction in income tax expense, and a $1.5 million, or $0.03 per diluted share, benefit of tax-exempt income from bank owned life insurance proceeds in excess of the cash surrender value of the policies, recorded in the first quarter of 2017. Earnings for the year ended December 31, 2016, included merger-related expenses associated with the acquisition of Hopewell Valley of approximately $2.4 million, net of tax, or $0.05 per diluted share.\nCommenting on the fourth quarter and annual results, Steven M. Klein, the Company’s President and Chief Executive Officer noted, “We remain focused on the fundamentals of disciplined loan and deposit generation, asset quality, and managing our net interest margin and efficiency ratio. Pre-tax income increased 10% for the quarter as compared to the third quarter of 2017, and 12% as compared to the fourth quarter of 2016. Originated loans grew 2.7% for the quarter and 13.1% for the year, and deposits, excluding broker deposits, increased 3.5% for the quarter, and 2.7% for the year. Although we continue to experience pricing pressure on both sides of the balance sheet, our net interest margin remained stable for the quarter with a one basis point decrease to 2.96%, compared to the prior quarter and prior year quarter. Expense management is critical to our operating model and our efficiency ratio continued to improve to 53.9% for the fourth quarter as compared to 56.2% for the prior quarter, and 56.5% for the prior year fourth quarter.”\nMr. Klein continued, “The fourth quarter results included a non-cash charge of approximately $10.5 million as a result of federal income tax reform enacted in December of 2017. Our capital remains strong, and we believe we are well positioned to execute on our strategic plan, and the benefits from the lower Federal income tax rates will allow us to further invest in our communities, our customers and our employees to continue to build shareholder value.” Mr. Klein further noted, “I’m pleased to announce that The Board of Directors has declared a cash dividend of $0.10 per common share payable on February 21, 2018, to stockholders of record on February 7, 2018.”\nResults of Operations\nComparison of Operating Results for the Year Ended December 31, 2017 and 2016\nNet income was $24.8 million and $26.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Significant variances from the prior year are as follows: a $5.6 million increase in net interest income, a $776,000 increase in the provision for loan losses, a $1.6 million increase in non-interest income, a $5.6 million decrease in non-interest expense, and a $13.3 million increase in income tax expense. Net income for the year ended December 31, 2017 includes an estimated tax charge of approximately $10.5 million related to the enactment of the Tax Reform Act in the fourth quarter of 2017. Beginning in 2018, the Tax Reform Act, among other things, reduces the federal corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21%, which resulted in a reduction in our net deferred tax assets and a corresponding charge to income tax expense of approximately $10.5 million.\nNet interest income for the year ended December 31, 2017, increased $5.6 million, or 5.4%, to $108.9 million, from $103.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, primarily due to a $182.5 million, or 5.3%, increase in our average interest-earning assets, and a one basis point increase in our net interest margin to 2.99%. The increase in average interest-earning assets was primarily attributable to increases in average loans outstanding of $271.1 million and other securities of $11.9 million, partially offset by decreases in average mortgage-backed securities of $91.2 million and interest-earning deposits in financial institutions of $10.0 million. The increase in average loans was primarily due to originated loan growth. Net interest income for the year ended December 31, 2017, included loan prepayment income of $1.4 million, compared to $1.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. Yields earned on interest-earning assets increased three basis points to 3.64% for the year ended December 31, 2017, from 3.61% for the year ended December 31, 2016, driven by higher yields on securities, Federal Home Loan Bank of New York stock and interest-earning deposits in financial institutions, partially offset by lower yields on loans. The cost of interest-bearing liabilities increased five basis points to 0.85% for the year ended December 31, 2017, as compared to 0.80% for the prior year, primarily due to higher rates on certificates of deposit and borrowed funds.\nThe provision for loan losses increased $776,000 to $1.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, from $635,000 for the year ended December 31, 2016, primarily due to growth in the loan portfolio, partially offset by declines in non-performing loans, and net recoveries during the year ended December 31, 2017. Net recoveries were $154,000 for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to net charge-offs of $810,000 for the year ended December 31, 2016.\nNon-interest income increased $1.6 million, or 15.6%, to $11.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, from $10.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, primarily due to an increase of $1.5 million in income on bank owned life insurance, attributable to insurance proceeds in excess of the related cash surrender value of the policies, and an increase of $470,000 in gains on securities transactions, net. Partially offsetting these increases was a decrease in fees and service charges for customer services of $232,000. Securities gains, net, in 2017, included gains of $1.1 million related to the Company’s trading portfolio, compared to gains of $507,000 in the comparative prior year. The trading portfolio is utilized to fund the Company’s deferred compensation obligation to certain employees and directors of the Company's deferred compensation plan (the Plan). The participants of this Plan, at their election, defer a portion of their compensation. Gains and losses on trading securities have no effect on net income since participants benefit from, and bear the full risk of, changes in the trading securities market values. Therefore, the Company records an equal and offsetting amount in compensation expense, reflecting the change in the Company’s obligations under the Plan.\nNon-interest expense decreased $5.6 million, or 7.6%, to $67.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, from $72.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The decrease was primarily due to a $4.0 million reduction in merger-related expenses which were associated with the Hopewell Valley acquisition reflected in 2016. Compensation and employee benefits expense decreased $1.5 million, due primarily to a reduction in severance, retention, and change-in-control compensation associated with the Hopewell Valley acquisition in the prior year, partially offset by annual merit-related salary increases and an increase in expenses related to the Company’s deferred compensation plan, which is described above, and which has no effect on net income. Data processing fees decreased $1.5 million, primarily due to non-recurring conversion costs and contract termination costs associated with the Hopewell Valley acquisition incurred in the prior year. Professional fees decreased $687,000 primarily due to non-recurring merger-related professional fees associated with the Hopewell Valley acquisition incurred in the prior year. FDIC insurance expense decreased by $430,000 due to a reduction in the FDIC's assessment rates for depository institutions with less than $10.0 billion in assets, which became effective in the quarter ended September 30, 2016. Other expense decreased by $1.0 million, primarily due to lower directors' equity award expense, related to the retirement of three directors.\nThe Company recorded income tax expense of $27.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to $13.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2017, was 52.1%, compared to 34.3% for the year ended December 31, 2016. The effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2017 was affected by (i) an estimated tax charge of $10.5 million related to the Tax Reform Act as noted above; (ii) the adoption of ASU 2016-09 in the first quarter of 2017, which resulted in a $2.3 million reduction in income tax expense related to the exercise or vesting of equity awards, which were previously recorded through equity as an adjustment to additional paid in capital; and (iii) $1.5 million of tax-exempt income from bank owned life insurance proceeds in excess of the cash surrender value of the policies. The effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2016, was affected by $211,000 of non-deductible merger related expenses.\nComparison of Operating Results for the Three Months Ended December 31, 2017 and 2016\nThe Company recorded a net loss of $1.7 million for the quarter ended December 31, 2017 as compared to net income of $8.2 million for the quarter ended December 31, 2016. Significant variances from the comparable prior quarter are as follows: a $1.3 million increase in net interest income, a $240,000 decrease in the provision for loan losses, a $200,000 decrease in non-interest income, a $188,000 decrease in non-interest expense, and an $11.4 million increase in income tax expense, which includes an estimated tax charge of $10.5 million related to the impact of the Tax Reform Act, discussed above.\nNet interest income for the quarter ended December 31, 2017, increased $1.3 million, or 4.8%, primarily due to an increase in our average interest-earning assets of $168.5 million, or 4.7%, partially offset by a one basis point decrease in our net interest margin to 2.96%. The increase in average interest-earning assets was primarily attributable to an increase in average loans outstanding of $192.1 million and an increase in other securities of $21.9 million, partially offset by a decrease in average mortgage-backed securities of $43.0 million. The increase in average loans was primarily due to originated loan growth. The quarter ended December 31, 2017, included loan prepayment income of $558,000 as compared to $539,000 for the quarter ended December 31, 2016. Yields earned on interest-earning assets increased nine basis points to 3.67% for the quarter ended December 31, 2017, from 3.58% for the quarter ended December 31, 2016, driven by higher yields on all asset classes. The cost of interest-bearing liabilities increased 13 basis points to 0.91% for the current quarter as compared to 0.78% for the comparable prior year quarter, attributable to higher rates on deposits and borrowed funds.\nThe provision for loan losses decreased by $240,000 to $40,000 for the quarter ended December 31, 2017, from $280,000 for the quarter ended December 31, 2016, primarily due to an improvement in asset quality indicators, including declines in non-performing loans and net recoveries, partially offset by the increase in provision related to growth in the portfolio. Net recoveries were $21,000 for the quarter ended December 31, 2017, compared to net charge-offs of $25,000 for the quarter ended December 31, 2016.\nNon-interest income decreased by $200,000 or 7.6%, to $2.4 million for the quarter ended December 31, 2017, from $2.6 million for the quarter ended December 31, 2016, primarily due to a decrease in fees and service charges for customers of $168,000.\nNon-interest expense remained relatively stable at $16.4 million for the quarter ended December 31, 2017, as compared to $16.6 million for the comparable prior year quarter.\nThe Company recorded income tax expense of $15.7 million for the quarter ended December 31, 2017, compared to $4.3 million for the quarter ended December 31, 2016. The effective tax rate for the quarter ended December 31, 2017, was 112.3% as compared to 34.3% for the quarter ended December 31, 2016. As noted above, income tax expense for the quarter ended December 31, 2017, includes an estimated tax charge of $10.5 million related to the Tax Reform Act.\nComparison of Operating Results for the Three Months Ended December 31, 2017, and September 30, 2017\nThe Company recorded a net loss of $1.7 million for the quarter ended December 31, 2017, compared to net income of $8.1 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2017. Significant variances from the prior quarter are as follows: a $603,000 increase in net interest income, a $448,000 decrease in the provision for loan losses, a $172,000 decrease in non-interest income, a $440,000 decrease in non-interest expense, and an $11.2 million increase in income tax expense which includes an estimated tax charge of $10.5 million related to the impact of the Tax Reform Act, discussed above.\nNet interest income for the quarter ended December 31, 2017, increased $603,000, or 2.2%, due to an $87.2 million, or 2.4%, increase in average interest-earning assets, partially offset by a one basis point decrease in the net interest margin to 2.96%. The increase in average interest-earning assets was primarily attributable to increases in average loans outstanding of $61.1 million, and average mortgage-backed securities of $29.4 million. The quarter ended December 31, 2017, included loan prepayment income of $558,000 as compared to $366,000 for the quarter ended September 30, 2017. Yields earned on interest-earning assets increased three basis points to 3.67% for the quarter ended December 31, 2017, as compared to 3.64% for the quarter ended September 30, 2017, primarily driven by higher yields on loans. The cost of interest-bearing liabilities increased five basis points to 0.91% for the current quarter as compared to 0.86% for the quarter ended September 30, 2017, attributable to higher rates on deposits and borrowed funds.\nThe provision for loan losses decreased by $448,000 to $40,000 for the quarter ended December 31, 2017, from $488,000 for the quarter ended September 30, 2017, primarily due to an improvement in asset quality indicators. Net recoveries were $21,000 for the quarter ended December 31, 2017, compared to net recoveries of $6,000 for the quarter ended September 30, 2017.\nNon-interest income decreased by $172,000 or 6.6%, to $2.4 million for the quarter ended December 31, 2017, from $2.6 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2017, primarily due to decreases in fees and service charges for customers of $99,000 and gains on securities transactions, net, of $55,000.\nNon-interest expense decreased $440,000, or 2.6%, to $16.4 million for the quarter ended December 31, 2017, from $16.8 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2017, primarily due to a decrease of $695,000 in compensation and employee benefits, partially offset by an increase in professional fees of $171,000.\nThe Company recorded income tax expense of $15.7 million for the quarter ended December 31, 2017, compared to $4.5 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2017. The effective tax rate for the quarter ended December 31, 2017, was 112.3%, as compared to 35.8% for the quarter ended September 30, 2017. Income tax expense for the quarter ended December 31, 2017, includes an estimated tax charge of $10.5 million related to the Tax Reform Act discussed above.\nFinancial Condition\nTotal assets increased $141.3 million, or 3.7%, to $3.99 billion at December 31, 2017, from $3.85 billion at December 31, 2016. The increase was primarily attributable to an increase in loans held-for-investment, net, of $172.7 million, and an increase in our securities portfolio of $17.7 million, partially offset by decreases in cash and cash equivalents of $38.2 million and other assets of $11.7 million.\nAs of December 31, 2017, we estimate that our non-owner occupied commercial real estate concentration (as defined by regulatory guidance issued in 2006) to total risk-based capital was approximately 412.2%. Management believes that Northfield Bank (the Bank) has implemented appropriate risk management practices including risk assessments, board approved underwriting policies and related procedures which include, monitoring Bank portfolio performance, performing market analysis (economic and real estate), and stressing of the Bank’s commercial real estate portfolio under severe adverse economic conditions. Although management believes the Bank has implemented appropriate policies and procedures to manage our commercial real estate concentration risk, the Bank’s regulators could require us to implement additional policies and procedures or could require us to maintain higher levels of regulatory capital, which might adversely affect our loan originations, ability to pay dividends, and profitability.\nLoans held-for-investment, net, increased $172.7 million to $3.14 billion at December 31, 2017, as compared to $2.97 billion at December 31, 2016. Originated loans held-for-investment, net, totaled $2.43 billion at December 31, 2017, as compared to $2.14 billion at December 31, 2016. The increase was primarily due to an increase in multifamily real estate loans of $229.4 million, or 15.2%, to $1.74 billion at December 31, 2017, from $1.51 billion at December 31, 2016, and to a lesser extent, increases of $32.6 million, or 7.9%, in commercial real estate loans, and $20.5 million, or 145.6%, in construction and land loans. The following tables detail our multifamily real estate originations for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 (dollars in thousands):\nYear Ended December 31, 2017 Originations Weighted Average\nInterest Rate Weighted Average\nLoan-to-Value Ratio Weighted Average Months to Next\nRate Change or Maturity for Fixed\nRate Loans (F)ixed or\n(V)ariable Amortization\nTerm $ 352,031 3.64 % 61 % 80 V 15-30 Years 750 5.07 % 48 % 1 V 25 Years 16,640 3.95 % 44 % 180 F 15 Years $ 369,421 3.65 % 60 %\nYear Ended December 31, 2016 Originations Weighted Average\nInterest Rate Weighted Average\nLoan-to-Value Ratio Weighted Average Months to Next\nRate Change or Maturity for Fixed\nRate Loans (F)ixed or\n(V)ariable Amortization\nTerm $ 312,716 3.41 % 62 % 80 V 30 Years 11,821 3.76 % 40 % 140 F 7- 20 Years $ 324,537 3.42 % 62 % Acquired loans decreased by $100.4 million to $692.8 million at December 31, 2017, from $793.2 million at December 31, 2016, primarily due to paydowns, partially offset by purchases of one-to-four family residential mortgage and multifamily real estate loan pools totaling $63.6 million during the year ended December 31, 2017. The geographic locations of the properties collateralizing the loans are as follows: 55.3% in New York, 15.9% in New Jersey, 9.2% in California, and 19.6% in other states.\nThe following table provides the details of the loans purchased during the year ended December 31, 2017 (dollars in thousands):\nYear Ended December 31, 2017 Purchase\nAmount Loan Type Weighted\nAverage Interest\nRate (1) Weighted Average\nLoan-to-Value\nRatio (2) Weighted Average Months to\nNext Rate Change or\nMaturity for Fixed Rate\nLoans (2) (F)ixed or\n(V)ariable Original\nAmortization\nTerm $ 29,286 Residential 2.89 % 57 % 1 V 30 Years 4,812 Residential 3.46 % 62 % 286 F 15-30 Years 18,774 Multifamily 3.35 % 55 % 53 V 30 Years 3,399 Multifamily 3.40 % 58 % 46 F 30 Years 7,280 Multifamily 3.35 % 51 % 58 V 30 Years $ 63,551 3.15 % 56 % (1) Net of servicing fee.\n(2) At time of purchase.\nPurchased credit-impaired (PCI) loans totaled $22.7 million at December 31, 2017, as compared to $30.5 million at December 31, 2016. The majority of the PCI loan balance consists of loans acquired as part of a Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation-assisted transaction. The Company accreted interest income of $1.4 million and $5.5 million attributable to PCI loans for the three months and year ended December 31, 2017, respectively, as compared to $1.2 million and $5.2 million for the three months and year-ended December 31, 2016, respectively.\nThe Company’s available-for-sale securities portfolio totaled $515.1 million at December 31, 2017, compared to $498.9 million at December 31, 2016. At December 31, 2017, $445.2 million of the portfolio consisted of residential mortgage-backed securities issued or guaranteed by Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, or Ginnie Mae. In addition, the Company held $68.1 million in corporate bonds, all of which were considered investment grade at December 31, 2017, and other securities of $1.8 million (including $323,000 of equity investments in money market mutual funds).\nTotal liabilities increased $123.6 million, or 3.8%, to $3.35 billion at December 31, 2017, from $3.23 billion at December 31, 2016. The increase was primarily attributable to increases in deposits of $123.4 million and other borrowings of $4.3 million, partially offset by a decrease in securities sold under agreements to repurchase of $6.0 million.\nDeposits increased $123.4 million, or 4.5%, to $2.84 billion at December 31, 2017, from $2.71 billion at December 31, 2016. The increase was attributable to increases of $202.9 million in certificate of deposit accounts, and $14.5 million in transaction accounts, partially offset by decreases of $76.1 million in savings accounts and $17.8 million in money market accounts.\nBorrowings and securities sold under agreements to repurchase decreased by $1.7 million, or 0.4%, to $471.5 million at December 31, 2017, from $473.2 million at December 31, 2016. Management utilizes borrowings to mitigate interest rate risk, for short-term liquidity, and to a lesser extent as part of leverage strategies.\nThe following is a table of term borrowing maturities (excluding capitalized leases and overnight borrowings) and the weighted average rate by year at December 31, 2017 (dollars in thousands):\nYear Amount Weighted Average Rate 2018 $162,715 1.64% 2019 123,502 1.48% 2020 90,000 1.65% 2021 70,000 1.80% 2022 20,000 1.97% $466,217 1.64% Total stockholders’ equity increased by $17.7 million to $638.9 million at December 31, 2017, from $621.2 million at December 31, 2016. This increase was primarily attributable to net income of $24.8 million for year ended December 31, 2017, and an $8.8 million increase related to equity award activity, partially offset by dividend payments of $15.6 million.\nAsset Quality\nThe following table details total originated and acquired (but excluding PCI) non-accruing loans, non-performing loans, non-performing assets, troubled debt restructurings on which interest is accruing, and accruing loans 30 to 89 days delinquent at December 31, 2017, and December 31, 2016 (dollars in thousands):\nDecember 31, 2017 December 31, 2016 Non-accrual loans: Real estate loans: Commercial $ 4,087 $ 5,513 One-to-four family residential 774 1,629 Multifamily 417 43 Home equity and lines of credit 156 127 Commercial and industrial 74 9 Total non-accrual loans: 5,508 7,321 Loans delinquent 90 days or more and still accruing: Real estate loans: One-to-four family residential 27 52 Home equity and lines of credit — 8 Other loans 1 — Total loans delinquent 90 days or more and still accruing 28 60 Total non-performing loans 5,536 7,381 Other real estate owned 850 850 Total non-performing assets $ 6,386 $ 8,231 Non-performing loans to total loans held-for-investment, net 0.18 % 0.25 % Non-performing assets to total assets 0.16 % 0.21 % Loans subject to restructuring agreements and still accruing $ 18,003 $ 20,628 Accruing loans 30-89 days delinquent $ 12,044 $ 10,100 Accruing Loans 30 to 89 Days Delinquent\nLoans 30 to 89 days delinquent and on accrual status totaled $12.0 million and $10.1 million at December 31, 2017, and December 31, 2016, respectively.
