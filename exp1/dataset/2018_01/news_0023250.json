Trump had often complained about U.S. libel laws on the 2016 campaign trail.\n“We are going to take a strong look at our country’s libel laws so that when somebody says something that is false and defamatory about someone, that person will have meaningful recourse in our courts,” Trump said.\nReporting By Steve Holland\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-01-11T01:36:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-11T03:57:17.019+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
