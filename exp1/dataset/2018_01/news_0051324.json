(NYSE:SF) today reported net loss attributable to common shareholders of $4.3 million, or $0.06 per diluted common share on record net revenues of $804.1 million for the three months ended December 31, 2017, compared with net income available to common shareholders of $24.5 million, or $0.31 per diluted common share, on net revenues of $661.4 million for the fourth quarter of 2016.\nFor the three months ended December 31, 2017, the Company reported record non-GAAP net income available to common shareholders of $120.6 million, or $1.47 per diluted common share. The Company’s reported GAAP net income for the three months ended December 31, 2017 was primarily impacted by 1) actions taken by the Company in response to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (“Tax Legislation”) that was enacted in the fourth quarter of 2017 to maximize tax savings; 2) litigation-related expenses associated with previously disclosed legal matters; 3) expected merger-related charges; 4) the revaluation of the Company’s deferred tax assets as a result of the enacted Tax Legislation; and 5) the favorable impact of the adoption of new accounting guidance during 2017 associated with stock-based compensation. Details discussed below and in the “Non-GAAP Financial Matters” section.\nChairman’s Comments\n“We are pleased to announce that 2017 was our 22nd consecutive year of record net revenue of $2.9 billion that increased 14% from 2016. Both of our operating segments generated record results, as the investments we’ve made in our business generated stronger results and an improving economy provided a better operating environment than we experienced in the past few years. Wealth management benefitted from the further expansion of our bank balance sheet and growth in our fee-based assets. Our institutional group’s record results were driven by record investment banking activity in both advisory and underwriting that more than offset an industry-wide slowdown in trading activity. The result of our record revenue coupled with solid expense management was record non-GAAP net income as well as return on common equity of nearly 18% in the fourth quarter. We believe that this level of operating leverage is indicative of our capabilities as Stifel is well positioned to capitalize on the current market tailwinds of the lower corporate U.S. tax rates and improved global economic growth,” stated Ronald J. Kruszewski, Chairman & CEO of Stifel.\nFourth Quarter Review\nQuarterly Highlights\nRecord net revenues of $804.1 million, increased 21.6% compared with the year-ago quarter.

Specifically, the Company believes that the non-GAAP measures provide useful information by excluding certain items that may not be indicative of the Company’s core operating results and business outlook. The Company believes that these non-GAAP measures will allow for a better evaluation of the operating performance of the business and facilitate a meaningful comparison of the Company’s results in the current period to those in prior and future periods. Reference to these non-GAAP measures should not be considered as a substitute for results that are presented in a manner consistent with GAAP. These non-GAAP measures are provided to enhance investors' overall understanding of the Company’s current financial performance. The non-GAAP financial information should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for or as being superior to, operating income, cash flows, or other measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. These non-GAAP measures primarily exclude expenses which management believes are, in some instances, non-recurring and not representative of on-going business.\nA limitation of utilizing these non-GAAP measures is that the GAAP accounting effects of these charges do, in fact, reflect the underlying financial results of the Company’s business and these effects should not be ignored in evaluating and analyzing its financial results. Therefore, the Company believes that GAAP measures and the same respective non-GAAP measures of the Company’s financial performance should be considered together.\nThe following table provides details with respect to reconciling net income and earnings per diluted common share on a GAAP basis for the three months ended December 31, 2017, September 30, 2017, and December 31, 2016 and the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 to net income and earnings per diluted common share on a non-GAAP basis for the same period.\nThree Months Ended Year Ended (in 000s) 12/31/2017 12/31/2016 9/30/2017 12/31/2017 12/31/2016 GAAP net income/(loss) $ (1,988 ) $ 26,880 $ 66,536 $ 182,871 $ 81,520 Preferred dividend 2,344 2,343 2,343 9,375 3,906 Net income/(loss) available to common shareholders (4,332 ) 24,537 64,193 173,496 77,614 Non-GAAP adjustments: Tax reform (14) 135,525 — — 135,525 — Merger-related (15) 9,447 14,226 10,244 49,205 132,016 Litigation-related (16) 15,961 20,000 — 35,961 31,796 Severance 1,432 — 2,538 10,925 — Provision for income taxes (17) (37,408 ) (4,578 ) (5,369 ) (81,729 ) (55,721 ) Total non-GAAP adjustments 124,957 29,648 7,413 149,887 108,091 Non-GAAP net income available to common shareholders $ 120,625 $ 54,185 $ 71,606 $ 323,383 $ 185,705 Weighted average diluted shares outstanding 82,267 79,539 80,881 81,035 77,563 GAAP earnings per diluted common share (1) $ (0.03 ) $ 0.34 $ 0.82 $ 2.26 $ 1.05 Non-GAAP adjustments 1.52 0.37 0.09 1.85 1.39 Non-GAAP earnings per diluted common share $ 1.49 $ 0.71 $ 0.91 $ 4.11 $ 2.44 GAAP earnings per diluted common share available to common shareholders (1) $ (0.06 ) $ 0.31 $ 0.79 $ 2.14 $ 1.00 Non-GAAP adjustments 1.53 0.37 0.10 1.85 1.39 Non-GAAP earnings per diluted common share available to common shareholders $ 1.47 $ 0.68 $ 0.89 $ 3.99 $ 2.39\nFootnotes\n(1) GAAP earnings per share for the three months ended December 31, 2017 is calculated using the basic weighted average number of common shares outstanding, not fully dilutive shares, as they are anti-dilutive in periods a loss is incurred.\n(2) Reconciliations of the Company’s GAAP results to these non-GAAP measures are discussed within and under “Non-GAAP Financial Measures.”\n(3) Excludes revenue included in the Other segment\n(4) See further discussion of non-GAAP adjustments under “Non-GAAP Financial Measures.”\n(5) During the first quarter of 2017, the Company adopted new accounting guidance associated with stock-based compensation.\n(6) Non-GAAP pre-tax margin for the three months ended December 31, 2017 of 20.1% is calculated by adding tax reform, merger-related and severance non-GAAP adjustments of $162.4 million to our GAAP loss before income taxes of $0.8 million and dividing it by non-GAAP net revenues for the quarter of $804.1 million.
