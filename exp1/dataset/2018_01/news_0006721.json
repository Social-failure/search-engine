The United States is by far the largest market in North America. \nTruck order growth in 2018 could be further boosted by a federal mandate that truck firms switch to electronic logs (ELDs) from paper logs. That mandate went into effect in mid-December. \nExperts predict many smaller truck companies that fudge the books in order to stay profitable in a low-margin industry will close up shop, benefiting larger companies and driving up demand for new vehicles. \n“Our forecast continues to call for an increase in production for 2018, but market expectations are varied for 2019,” FTR Chief Operating Officer Jonathan Starks said in a statement. \nThe main truck makers in the U.S. market are Daimler AG ( DAIGn.DE ), Navistar International Corp ( NAV.N ), PACCAR Inc ( PCAR.O ) and Volvo AB ( VOLVb.ST ). \nFTR said orders in December were spread unevenly among truck manufacturers, but said no single company “is showing any significant weakness in order activity.” Reporting by Nick Carey; Editing by Jonathan Oatis", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-05T18:13:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-05T18:27:51.001+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
