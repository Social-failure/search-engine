EnQuest holds a 70.5 percent stake in Kraken where production is expected to ramp up to 50,000 barrels per day (bpd) by mid-year following its start-up last June.\nEnQuest declined to comment.\nEnQuest has previously sought buyers for a stake in its flagship $2.5 billion development to help with its costs but talks with Israeli conglomerate Delek Group failed in 2016.\nThe heavily-indebted company, headed by Chief Executive Amjad Bseisu, is hoping to attract more interest now that the field is up and running.\nThe recent sharp rise in oil prices to around $70 a barrel, levels not seen since 2014, is expect to spur further interest, banking sources said.\nThe start-up of the field has had some technical hiccups that forced the company to cut its production targets for 2017.\nLast November, EnQuest said Kraken was producing around 23,000 bpd, with production expected to reach its target in the first half of 2018.\nEnQuest’s lenders in November agreed to ease the terms of its loans as it struggled with a debt of around $2 billion compared with a market value of around $680 million.\nIn the sale document, EnQuest, which specialises in extending the life of ageing fields, said it intended to open a dataroom in January and set a deadline for bids in March or April.\nAnalysts at Barclays in December valued EnQuest’s 70.5 percent stake at around $1.4 billion while Jefferies analysts valued it at around $1.3 billion. Cairn Energy owns the remaining 29.5 percent in the Kraken field.
