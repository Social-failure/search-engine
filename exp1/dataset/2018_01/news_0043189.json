Core earnings in 2017 increased to $32.1 million, or $2.10 per share, from $13.9 million in 2016, or $1.52 per share. Earnings grew during 2017 due to business expansion, investments in talent and increased operational efficiencies.\nFourth quarter GAAP earnings were $6.6 million, or 43 cents per share. Core earnings totaled $9.0 million, or 58 cents per share. GAAP earnings included a $4.0 million income tax charge due to the revaluation of net deferred tax assets required by the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (“TCJA”). In addition, there was a net benefit of $2.6 million, which included the sale of the insurance subsidiary offset by other one-time charges.\nFOURTH QUARTER FINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS (comparisons are to prior quarter unless otherwise stated):\n1.02% core return on assets (non-GAAP measure) 21% annualized commercial loan growth 13% annualized total deposit growth 53% efficiency ratio (non-GAAP measure) 9.97% core return on equity (non-GAAP measure)\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer, Curtis C. Simard stated, “We delivered a strong finish to all of our key performance indicators within mere quarters of doubling our asset size and successfully completing a system conversion. Based on our momentum, we are well ahead of the earn back period from the acquisition and are poised to deliver another great year as we hold firm to our model of balancing growth and earnings.”\nMr. Simard went on to say, “Management continues to evolve as we attract seasoned, proven executives and senior managers to join our team. Earlier this week we announced a new EVP, Director of Retail Delivery, Marion Colombo, who will be joining the bank to lead our retail franchise.” Mr. Simard commented, “Simply put, retail branch activity is at the very heart of our business. Finding a long-term proven leader like Marion, who comes with over twenty-nine years of retail experience in many diverse markets, is a significant indication of our commitment to being a true community bank with a growing retail franchise.”\nExcluding the impact of TCJA and other one-time adjustments, our fourth quarter performance peaked for the year with a return on assets of 1.02% and a return on equity of 9.97%. The tangible equity to tangible asset ratio (a non-GAAP measure) decreased to 7.12% at the end of the fourth quarter primarily due to the impact of the TCJA adjustment. We expect this reduction will be earned back from related tax savings within the first half of 2018 with opportunities for further expansion thereafter.\nMr. Simard further stated, “Our Commercial teams continue to penetrate their markets as is evidenced by another strong quarter of 21% loan growth led by commercial and industrial loans at 34%. Asset quality metrics remain strong while charge-offs are at historical lows. We also expanded our Treasury Management Services platform during the fourth quarter, which was rolled out in January 2018. Given the talent we have hired to manage this business and the enhanced capabilities, we expect this to be a significant contributor in 2018 in terms of both fee revenue and deposit gathering.”\nMr. Simard concluded, “As we enter 2018, we are positioned to continue with the momentum seen during the second half of 2017 while executing on our strategy to provide our customers with the best customer service. We remain committed to our communities and will seek opportunities to expand our branch model as a true community bank in 2018.”\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nGAAP earnings decreased to $6.6 million in the fourth quarter from $8.6 million in the third quarter. The decrease was primarily due to the TCJA charge offset by other one-time adjustments including the sale of our insurance subsidiary. Core earnings (a non-GAAP measure) increased to $9.0 million in the fourth quarter compared to $8.8 million in the prior quarter. Yields on loans decreased 1 basis point to 4.12% in the fourth quarter due to lower purchased loan accretion as compared to the third quarter. Excluding the impact of purchase loan accretion, loan yield expanded 2 basis points to 3.92% in the fourth quarter from 3.90% in the third quarter. The loan yield benefited from a $29 million average balance increase in fixed rate commercial real estate products. Security yields decreased in the fourth quarter as a result of accelerated premium amortization. The cost of interest-bearing deposits increased as a result of both interest rate hikes and an extension in maturities as we manage our overall interest rate risk. The Company’s overall cost of funds remained relatively flat for the quarter as the 13% growth in deposits offset more expensive alternative borrowing costs.\nTotal non-interest income was $6.5 million in the fourth quarter compared to $7.0 million in the prior quarter. The decrease is primarily due to seasonality effects on customer service fees and the curtailment of revenue with the sale of our insurance subsidiary in October 2017. As previously announced, the sale of the insurance subsidiary was part of a strategic decision to redeploy capital and management resources to core businesses. The sale had no significant impact to core net income as the contribution margin was neutral. Trust and management fee income during the fourth quarter remained flat with the third quarter. Overall, the unfavorable variability of transactional fees during 2017 was offset by the growth of assets under management to $445 million at the end of 2017 from $425 million at the end of 2016. Non-interest expense excluding acquisition, conversion and other one-time adjustments decreased $362 thousand in the fourth quarter compared to the linked quarter. The efficiency ratio was 53% for the quarter compared to 54% in the third quarter, which reflects further disciplined cost control.\nFINANCIAL CONDITION\nTotal assets grew $89 million during the fourth quarter to $3.6 billion driven by total loan growth of $57 million, or 9% on an annualized basis. The majority of the loan growth was led by the commercial portfolio, which had an annualized growth rate of 21%. Total loan growth was funded by growth in deposits, which increased $77 million, or 13% on an annualized basis. Non-accruing loans increased by $7.5 million during the quarter primarily due to the deterioration of one specific commercial relationship, which is expected to be settled at the full contractual obligation. Asset quality metrics remain strong with charge-offs at historical lows and an allowance for credit losses to total loans ratio of 0.50%. The Company's book value per share increased to $22.96 from $22.90 in the third quarter while tangible book value (a non-GAAP measure) increased to $15.94 from $15.84.\nBACKGROUND\nBar Harbor Bankshares (NYSE American: BHB) is the parent company of its wholly owned subsidiary, Bar Harbor Bank & Trust.

There are several factors that could cause actual results to differ significantly from expectations described in the forward-looking statements. For a discussion of such factors, please see the Company’s most recent reports on Forms 10-K and 10-Q filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission and available on the SEC’s website at www.sec.gov . The Company does not undertake any obligation to update forward-looking statements.\nNON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES\nThis document contains certain non-GAAP financial measures in addition to results presented in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (“GAAP”). These non-GAAP measures provide supplemental perspectives on operating results, performance trends, and financial condition. They are not a substitute for GAAP measures; they should be read and used in conjunction with the Company’s GAAP financial information. A reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP measures is included beginning on page J in the accompanying financial tables. In all cases, it should be understood that non-GAAP per share measures do not depict amounts that accrue directly to the benefit of shareholders.\nThe Company utilizes the non-GAAP measure of core earnings in evaluating operating trends, including components for core revenue and expense. These measures exclude items which the Company does not view as related to its normalized operations. These items include securities gains/losses, acquisition costs, restructuring costs, and systems conversion costs. Non-core adjustments are presented net of an adjustment for income tax expense. This adjustment is determined as the difference between the GAAP tax rate and the effective tax rate applicable to core income. The efficiency ratio is adjusted for non-core revenue and expense items and for tax preference items. The Company also calculates measures related to tangible equity, which adjust equity (and assets where applicable) to exclude intangible assets due to the importance of these measures to the investment community. Charges related to the acquisition of Lake Sunapee Bank Group consist primarily of severance and retention cost, systems conversion and integration costs, and professional fees. The Company’s disclosure of organic growth of loans in 2017 is also adjusted for the Lake Sunapee Bank Group acquisition.\nTABLE INDEX\nCONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL SCHEDULES (UNAUDITED) A\nSelected Financial Highlights\nB\nFootnotes to Selected Financial Highlights\nC\nBalance Sheets\nD\nLoan and Deposit Analysis\nE\nStatements of Income\nF\nStatements of Income (Five Quarter Trend)\nG\nAverage Yields and Costs\nH\nAverage Balances\nI\nAsset Quality Analysis\nJ\nReconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures (Five Quarter Trend) and Supplementary Data\nBAR HARBOR BANKSHARES SELECTED FINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS - UNAUDITED At or for the Quarters Ended (1)(3) Dec 31,\n2017 Sep 30,\n2017 Jun 30,\n2017 Mar 31,\n2017 Dec 31,\n2016 PER SHARE DATA Net earnings, diluted $ 0.43 $ 0.56 $ 0.42 $ 0.29 $ 0.28 Core earnings, diluted (1) (2) 0.58 0.57 0.52 0.43 0.41 Total book value 22.96 22.90 22.53 22.17 17.19 Tangible book value (2) 15.94 15.84 15.44 15.07 16.61 Market price at period end 27.01 31.36 30.82 33.08 31.55 Dividends 0.19 0.19 0.19 0.19 0.19 PERFORMANCE RATIOS Return on assets 0.75 % 0.99 % 0.76 % 0.50 % 0.59 % Core return on assets (1) (2) 1.02 1.01 0.94 0.74 0.87 Return on equity 7.35 9.67 7.55 5.34 6.36 Core return on equity (1) (2) 9.97 9.90 9.32 7.88 9.34 Core return on tangible equity (1) (2) 14.53 14.51 13.78 12.24 9.66 Net interest margin, fully taxable equivalent (FTE) (4) 3.04 3.06 3.16 3.11 2.89 Net interest margin (FTE), excluding purchased loan accretion (4) 2.93 2.93 3.02 3.01 2.89 Efficiency ratio (2) 53.09 53.59 54.64 61.62 59.24 GROWTH (Year-to-date, annualized) Total commercial loans (2) 23.8 % 20.5 % 7.2 % 20.0 % 14.9 % Total loans (2) 13.1 12.2 7.0 13.3 15.0 Total deposits (2) 14.4 10.6 2.3 (10.2 ) 6.5 FINANCIAL DATA (In millions) Total assets $ 3,565 $ 3,476 $ 3,503 $ 3,427 $ 1,755 Total earning assets 3,241 3,184 3,139 3,139 1,683 Total investments 755 756 763 767 554 Total loans 2,486 2,429 2,377 2,372 1,129 Allowance for loan losses 12 12 11 11 10 Total goodwill and intangible assets 108 109 109 109 5 Total deposits 2,352 2,275 2,213 2,174 1,050 Total shareholders' equity 355 353 347 341 157 Net income 7 9 7 4 3 Core income (2) 9 9 8 6 4 ASSET QUALITY AND CONDITION RATIOS Net charge-offs (current quarter annualized)/average loans (5) 0.04 % 0.01 % 0.03 % 0.06 % (0.03 )% Allowance for loan losses/total loans (5) 0.50 0.49 0.48 0.46 0.92 Loans/deposits 106 107 107 109 108 Shareholders' equity to total assets 9.95 10.17 9.91 9.95 8.93 Tangible shareholders' equity to tangible assets (2) 7.12 7.26 7.01 6.99 8.65 (1) Adjusted measurements are non-GAAP financial measures that are adjusted to exclude net non-operating charges primarily related to acquisitions, and gain on sale of securities.

The fair value of loans acquired in a business combination includes expected loan losses, and there is no loan loss allowance recorded for these loans at the time of acquisition. Accordingly, the ratio of the loan loss allowance to total loans is reduced as a result of the existence of such loans, and this measure is not directly comparable to prior periods. Similarly, net loan charge-offs are normally reduced for loans acquired in a business combination since these loans are recorded net of expected loan losses. Therefore, the ratio of net loan charge-offs to average loans is reduced as a result of the existence of such loans, and this measure is not directly comparable to prior periods. Other institutions may have loans acquired in a business combination, and therefore there may be no direct comparability of these ratios between and among other institutions.\nBAR HARBOR BANKSHARES CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS -
