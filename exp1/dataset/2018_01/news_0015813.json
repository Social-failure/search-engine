They are accused of receiving stolen property, with a combined value of S$896,444 ($676,510.45), at the Pulau Bukom site, where Shell has its largest refinery in the world, according to court documents.\nThe amount of oil products involved in the theft on two days in late 2017 were in addition to a combined 2,062 tonnes of gasoil valued at S$1.126 million specified in charges brought against the 11 on Tuesday.
