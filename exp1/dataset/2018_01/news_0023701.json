If the case moves forward, she could be formally charged and stand trial, Fernandez said.\n“I hold onto the solidarity that you offer me on the other side of the border, but above all the example of the brave migrant communities,” Maleno tweeted after testifying.\nMore than 3,000 migrants died attempting to cross the Mediterranean in 2017, the fourth straight year that the death toll has topped this figure, according to the U.N. Migration Agency (IOM).\nMost migrants attempting to reach Europe from Africa take the sea route from Libya to Italy, but last year saw a spike in the number of people departing from Morocco to Spain instead.\n“It is appalling that Helena is being put through this,” said Viviana Waisman, head of Women’s Link Worldwide.\n“It is a clear criminalisation of human rights defenders and one more step in the criminalisation of migrant people.”\nReporting by Nellie Peyton.
