They will need two more doses, spaced a month apart.\nIn the meantime, health workers are vaccinating another 160,000 Bangladeshi children who live in communities near to refugee settlements in the border district of Cox’s Bazar.\nDiphtheria had almost been eradicated in Bangladesh, with only two cases reported in 2016, said Catalin Bercaru, a WHO spokesman in the capital, Dhaka.\nWhen it appeared in the camps in November, “health workers were indeed surprised”, he told the Thomson Reuters Foundation by email.\nSince then, there have been suspected cases in nearby communities, he said.\nChildren are particularly vulnerable to diphtheria, a bacterial infection that causes dead tissue to build up over the throat and tonsils, making it difficult to breath. The disease also produces a toxin affecting other organs.\nDiphtheria is spread through direct contact with infected people or by breathing secretions from their coughs or sneezes.\n“One of the main reasons for the emergence of the outbreak is the low routine immunization coverage in Rakhine state of Myanmar, where the Rohingya population came from,” said Bercaru.\nThe influx of hundreds of thousands of Rohingya also created perfect conditions for the disease to spread, as the refugees are forced to live in close quarters with poor sanitation and limited access to health care.\nThe exodus of Rohingya refugees from Myanmar began after a Rohingya militant group launched deadly attacks on Myanmar police and military outposts last August.\nThe military responded with a sweeping counteroffensive that rights groups say have been accompanied by rapes and murders of Rohingya civilians. Myanmar has rejected accusations of ethnic cleansing, blaming most of the violence on the insurgents.\nReporting by Jared Ferrie; Editing by Ros Russell; Please credit the Thomson Reuters Foundation, the charitable arm of Thomson Reuters, that covers humanitarian news, women’s rights, trafficking, property rights, resilliance and climate change.
