It has also built ties to the public through events such as a Halloween party that drew 500 kids to a police station in a high-crime district. \nWhile there is no hard evidence that those initiatives were responsible, homicides in Chicago dropped 16 percent in 2017 to 650. That still outnumbered homicides in the two largest U.S. cities, New York and Los Angeles, combined. \n“There was a promise to never relive 2016,” said Anthony Guglielmi, chief communications officer for Chicago police. “That was a moment in time we never want to repeat in terms of violence.” \nWhile Chicago has seen volatile swings, New York has experienced a consistent reduction in crime, in sharp contrast with a bygone reputation as the country’s murder and mayhem capital. \nOn Friday the New York Police Department reported 290 murders in 2017, down 13 percent from 2016 and 87 percent from 1990, when a record 2,262 people were killed. \nThe New York Police Department called 2017 the safest year in nearly seven decades even as arrests decreased by nearly 400 per day from their high point seven years ago. \nExperts do not entirely understand the trend but point to a number of likely factors, including CompStat, the computer analysis of crime data that was developed by New York police in 1994 and has since been replicated in other cities. \nCompStat gives police daily reports on how they are performing, enabling them to quickly identify trends and deploy officers to trouble spots.

REUTERS/Joshua Lott \nData-driven, evidence-based policing has advanced further with the help of crime-predicting software like HunchLab and gunfire-detection system ShotSpotter. \nTechnology “helps us to link cases quicker, deploy faster and deploy smarter,” Dermot Shea, the NYPD’s chief of crime control strategies, told a news conference on Friday. \nThe public uproar over police shootings of unarmed black men across the United States in recent years has also convinced police they must adopt neighborhood or community policing. \nThat aims to improve relationships between police and residents of high-crime districts and reduce animosity toward police to gain more co-operation in solving and preventing crimes.

Before year’s end the centers had expanded to six of the city’s 22 districts.The program started in notoriously high crime districts such as Englewood and Harrison, where police said crime fell by 43 percent and 26 percent, respectively, in 2017. \nNow, when a trigger is pulled, Chicago police are alerted within 30 seconds by ShotSpotter, and the information is relayed to the smartphones of patrol officers within a minute, Guglielmi said. \nMeanwhile, with cameras switched on in the gunshot’s vicinity, the same data is run through the HunchLab system. Police and criminologists from the University of Chicago analyze the data in real time, dispatching updates to patrol officers, Guglielmi said. \nChicago police are now frequently responding to incidents as much as three minutes before witnesses report gunfire to the 911 emergency number, he said. \nThe Chicago experience appears to be “a promising step forward,” said Max Kapustin of the University of Chicago’s Crime Lab. \n“Certainly in the case of Chicago and specifically in the district of Englewood, there’s a lot of suggestive evidence that this led to those reductions and seems like a really meaningful way forward for reducing crime,” Kapustin said.
