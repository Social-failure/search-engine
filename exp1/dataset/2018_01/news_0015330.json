( reut.rs/2D0S11W ) \nXRP allows banks and payment companies to send money quickly, no matter the location. Its transaction fee, at just “fractions of a penny”, is also comparable to bitcoin’s $30 per transaction fee. \nSeveral companies such as UBS and Santander already use Ripple’s products to enable payments. In November 2017, American Express Co also launched an instant blockchain-based payment system using Ripple. \nChina's Ant Financial's deal to buy MoneyGram for $1.2 billion collapsed last week.
