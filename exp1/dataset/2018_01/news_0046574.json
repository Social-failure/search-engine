That complicates the job of authorities to catch market manipulators who secretly divert funds to risky financial products as they chase higher returns. \nThe plan, which is under discussion and may yet still change, could be announced after the National People’s Congress in March, Bloomberg reported, citing two of the people. \nAlternative plans that have been discussed include creating a super-regulator that also brings into its fold the central bank and stock market watchdog, as well as giving the People’s Bank of China (PBOC) greater oversight over the other three main regulatory bodies, according to Bloomberg. \nXi has said that financial security is a vital part of national security. Last year, a Financial Stability and Development Committee was established with Vice Premier Ma Kai as its head. \nSpeculation of a super-regulator has been rife for years. \nAfter the Chinese stock market crash of 2015, there was talk that China was considering bringing together its banking, insurance and securities regulators into a single super-commission. \nThe stock market crash was in part blamed on poor inter-agency coordination.
