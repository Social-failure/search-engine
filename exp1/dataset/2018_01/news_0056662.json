Snippets are relied on by Google’s virtual assistant to read out answers to searches conducted through smart speakers such as the Google Home. \nThe company introduced featured snippets four years ago to get people to desired information faster. But the feature has drawn scrutiny for highlighting inaccurate answers, with mishaps last year including snippets that said women were evil and that former U.S. President Barack Obama was planning a coup. \nThe latest changes address queries such as “are reptiles good pets,” Danny Sullivan, Google’s public liaison for search, wrote in the blog post. \nGoogle tries to answer with information “strongly aligned” with the search so a webpage contending reptiles are nice pets would likely be shown, Sullivan said. But users ultimately want to know how reptiles rate as pets one way or the other. The featured snippet for “are reptiles bad pets” would be valuable too even if it contradicts the first snippet, he said. \nIf Google succeeds in delivering multiple viewpoints in one answer for other queries, it could help lead users away from potentially skewed results when looking up topics such as “is the Earth flat” and “are vaccines dangerous.” \n”There are often legitimate diverse perspectives offered by publishers, and we want to provide users visibility and access into those perspectives from multiple sources,” Matthew Gray, Google’s software engineer overseeing featured snippets, was quoted in the blog post as saying. \nThe display for multiple featured snippets and how they would be presented over voice search has not been determined, Google said.
