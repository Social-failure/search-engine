The top 10 are all private, many of which have sky-high tuition prices, but their very generous aid packages tell a different story. 3:01 PM ET Wed, 20 Sept 2017 | 00:57 \nWhen it comes to college, most families assume public schools are far more affordable. That's only partly true. \nAt public, four-year institutions, costs for the 2017-18 school year hit $20,770, according to the College Board . Tuition plus room and board at four-year private universities was much higher: $47,000, on average, in the current academic year. \nHowever, about two-thirds of all full-time students receive aid, which can bring the sticker price significantly down. Your net price is a college's tuition and fees minus grants, scholarships and education tax benefits, according to the College Board. \nTo that end, The Princeton Review ranked colleges by how much financial aid is awarded and how satisfied students are with their packages. The report is based on data collected from fall 2016 through summer 2017. \nThe schools that fared the best were all private schools, many of which have sky-high prices, but very generous aid packages. show chapters 10:36 AM ET Fri, 31 March 2017 | 01:10 \n\"We look at sticker price but also academics and financial aid. And that's really where the value comes in,\" said Robert Franek, The Princeton Review's editor-in-chief and author of \"Colleges That Pay You Back.\" \nWhen it comes to offering aid , private schools typically have more money to spend, he added. \"These schools have been very clear about their commitment to making college costs affordable and giving out massive amounts of aid to students and families that need it.\" \nHere are the schools that made The Princeton Review's top 10: 10.
