You have to be very careful with statistics and I have no desire to start celebrating the fact that here, in the middle of January, we are in 12th place,” Hodgson told a news conference. \n”The only thing that interests me - and I have said it right from the start - is where we are on the final day of May and being one place above the relegation zone.

At that stage, things were looking very bleak. \n“It’s nice now that it no longer looks so bleak, and we should enjoy that, but there are going to be lots more games like the one today.” Slideshow (2 Images) \nSako scored the winner against Burnley by side-stepping defender Phil Bardsley and driving a powerful shot past goalkeeper Nick Pope for his seventh goal of the season. \nThe 29-year-old Mali international’s contract expires later this year, but Hodgson is confident he will sign a new deal. \n”Sako has come good for himself,“ the former England manager added. ”Before this season he spent a lot of time on the bench and I don’t quite know how many chances he has had, but he obviously hasn’t done well enough in those chances to force himself into the team, but he has done very well recently for us. \n“At the moment, it’s pretty obvious that Bakary can sit back quite comfortably knowing full well that if he continues playing like he is playing at the moment, he is going to get a new contract, without any shadow of doubt.” Reporting by Matt Westby; Editing by Christian Radnedge", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-13T20:37:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-13T21:10:56.067+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
