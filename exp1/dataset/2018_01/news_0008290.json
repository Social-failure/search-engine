The delisting will become effective on January 18, 2018. NYSE has advised Syngenta AG that it will suspend trading of the ADSs prior to the market opening on January 8, 2018. As such, holders of ADSs will not be able to trade their ADSs on NYSE thereafter.\nThe delisting is in connection with the completion of the acquisition of all publicly held registered shares of Syngenta AG by CNAC Saturn (NL) B.V. Upon satisfaction of the applicable requirements for deregistration, Syngenta AG intends to file the relevant form with the SEC under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the “Exchange Act”), requesting the deregistration of the ADSs under the Exchange Act and the suspension of Syngenta AG’s reporting obligations under the Exchange Act. Syngenta AG has not arranged (nor is it currently planning to arrange) for the listing of the ADSs on another securities exchange or for quotation of the ADSs on any other quotation medium.\nAbout Syngenta\nSyngenta is a leading agriculture company helping to improve global food security by enabling millions of farmers to make better use of available resources.
