He has also instituted stricter vetting requirements and quit negotiations on a voluntary pact to deal with global migration.\nIn late October, the Trump administration effectively paused refugee admissions from 11 countries mostly in the Middle East and Africa, pending a 90-day security review which was set to expire last week.\nThe countries subject to the review are Egypt, Iran, Iraq, Libya, Mali, North Korea, Somalia, South Sudan, Sudan, Syria and Yemen. It is unclear if these are the same “high-risk” countries referred to by Nielsen.\nFor each of the last three years, refugees from the 11 countries made up more than 40 percent of U.S. admissions. But a Reuters review of State Department data shows that as the 90-day review went into effect, refugee admissions from the 11 countries plummeted.\nOn Dec. 23, a federal judge in Seattle partially blocked restrictions on admitting refugees from the 11 countries, saying the administration could carry out the 90-day review, but could not stop processing or admitting refugees from the 11 countries in the meantime, as long as those refugees had significant ties to the United States.\nSince the judge’s ruling, 23 refugees from the 11 countries have been allowed into the United States, according to State Department data.\nReporting by Yeganeh Torbati; Writing by Susan Heavey; Editing by Paul Simao and David Gregorio\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-29T20:25:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-29T20:48:42.024+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
