We are advancing in that sense.”\nNevertheless, the auto sector still opposes any change on rules of origin, Castanon noted.\nTrump has threatened to pull out of NAFTA if it cannot be reworked in favor of U.S. interests.\nCastanon expressed optimism about the upcoming round of negotiations, saying chapters such as telecommunications, financial services and e-commerce were near resolution.\n“Practically half of the chapters could be closed if political will exists,” he said.\nThe Montreal talks are due to take place from Jan. 23 to 28, though Castanon said some discussions would start from Jan. 21.\nReporting by Anthony Esposito; Editing by David Gregorio\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-01-12T04:12:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-12T05:07:13.004+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
