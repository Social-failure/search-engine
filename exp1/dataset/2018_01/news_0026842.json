The offerings are subject to market and other conditions, and there can be no assurance as to whether or when either offering may be completed, or as to the actual size or terms of either offering. All the shares and warrants in the offerings are being offered by Genocea.\nCantor Fitzgerald & Co. is acting as the sole book-running manager for the offerings. Needham & Company and Robert W. Baird & Co are acting as the lead managers for the offerings.\nGenocea intends to use net proceeds from the concurrent offerings for the following purposes: to support the ongoing development of its GEN-009 program, including filing an IND with the FDA and commencing a Phase 1/2a clinical proof of concept trial, and for working capital and other general corporate purposes.\nThe securities described above are being offered by the Company pursuant to a shelf registration statement on Form S-3 previously filed with and declared effective by the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) on May 14, 2015. A preliminary prospectus supplement and the accompanying prospectus relating to the securities being offered will be filed for each offering with the SEC on January 16, 2018 and will be available on the SEC’s website at http://www.sec.gov . Copies of each preliminary prospectus supplement (when available) and the accompanying prospectus relating to the securities being offered in each offering may also be obtained from Cantor Fitzgerald & Co., Attention: Capital Markets, 499 Park Ave., 6th Floor, New York, New York 10022, or by telephone at 212-829-7122, or by e-mail at prospectus@cantor.com .\nThis press release shall not constitute an offer to sell or a solicitation of an offer to buy and there shall not be any sale of these securities in any state or jurisdiction in which such an offer, solicitation or sale would be unlawful prior to the registration or qualification under the securities laws of any such state or jurisdiction.

While traditional immunotherapy discovery methods have largely used predictive methods to propose T cell targets, or antigens, Genocea has successfully developed ATLAS™, its proprietary technology platform, to identify clinically relevant antigens of T cells based on actual human immune responses. Genocea uses ATLAS in immuno-oncology applications to develop neoantigen cancer vaccines while also exploring partnership opportunities for general cancer vaccines and a vaccine targeting cancers caused by Epstein-Barr Virus. Genocea expects to begin clinical development of its first neoantigen cancer vaccine, GEN-009, in 2018. Genocea is exploring strategic alternatives for GEN-003, its Phase 3-ready immunotherapy candidate for the treatment of genital herpes.\nForward-Looking Statements\nThis press release includes forward-looking statements, including statements relating to the proposed underwritten public offerings and the use of the net proceeds therefrom, within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act.
