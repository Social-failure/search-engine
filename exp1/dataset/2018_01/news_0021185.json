Arizona equalized at 9:01 with Derek Stepan’s ninth tally, a wrister from a sharp angle.\nPavelski made it 2-1 with a power-play marker at 10:59 when his centering pass for Tomas Hertl in the slot instead hit the stick of Coyotes defenseman Jason Demers and eluded Wedgewood. Arizona’s Alex Goligoski wasted no time tying it, snapping a shot from the right point past Jones at 12:16.\nLogan Couture’s 17th goal at 13:37 off a beautiful Donskoi pass -- he threaded the puck through Oliver Ekman-Larsson’s legs -- gave San Jose a 3-2 lead. But as the public-address announcer was exulting over that marker, Christian Fischer chased Jones 24 seconds later with a backhander for his 12th goal.\nThe second period was much more sedate. Donskoi managed the only goal at 17:07 when he beat Wedgewood to a loose puck between the circles and chipped it over the onrushing goalie for his first of the night.\nEkman-Larsson’s wrister through net-front traffic hit a Sharks defender and tied the game at 3:31 of the third period, his seventh of the season. Josh Archibald gave Arizona its first lead of the night, 4-3, with his second goal in as many nights and third of the season at 6:22.\nDell got the win, saving 13 of the 15 shots he faced. Wedgewood stopped 38 shots in the losing cause.\nSan Jose’s Brent Burns racked up three assists. Stepan finished with a goal and an assist, and the Coyotes’ Christian Dvorak added two assists.\n--Field Level Media\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-01-14T14:37:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-15T16:51:49.006+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
