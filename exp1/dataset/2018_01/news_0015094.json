We are working hard to get some contracts signed but I couldn’t say by when,” Statkraft CEO Christian Rynning-Toennesen told Reuters on the sidelines of a conference. \n“Competition is tough ... but we have a good offering. (Norway is now) a good place to establish an advanced computer based business,” he added. \nIn 2017, Statkraft received proceeds of between 1.2 billion and 1.5 billion euros ($1.44 billion-$1.80 billion) from divesting its offshore wind assets, money the company plans to re-invest. \n“Within the next three years we will invest all of it. It will be in hydropower, onshore wind and solar. Solar will be in India, Brazil and Europe,” Rynning-Toennesen said. \nHe declined to specify the size of the solar capacity that Statkraft plans to build and said the firm was evaluating different projects. $1 = 0.8310 euros Editing by Mark Potter", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-11T17:10:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-11T17:34:32.002+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
