It did not immediately reply to a request for comment, while Denizbank declined to comment on the issue. \n“Work on the sales process has been accelerated. Potential buyers have expressed their interest to the bank,” one of the sources close to the matter said. \n“Sberbank wants to exit. We know that Emirates NBD is among those interested, a bank from Kazakhstan as well,” another source knowledgable about the issue said. \nDenizbank shares were up 13.71 percent at 4.81 lira at the market close.
