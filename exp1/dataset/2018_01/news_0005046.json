Nobody,” Farage said. “Well I’ve finally got my meeting with Mr Barnier. Its going to happen.”\nFILE PHOTO: Nigel Farage, ex-leader of Britain's anti-EU UK Independence Party (UKIP), speaks at a press conference of the Germany's far-right Alternative for Deutschland (AfD) party in Berlin, Germany, September 8, 2017. REUTERS/Hannibal Hanschke/File Photo In the United Kingdom’s 2016 referendum, 51.9 percent, or 17.4 million people, voted to leave the EU while 48.1 percent, or 16.1 million people, voted to stay.\nMay has said Britain will leave the EU on March 29 at 2300GMT. The EU and Britain are discussing the terms of the divorce.\nFarage, 53, casts the EU as a doomed experiment in German-dominated unity and excessive debt-funded welfare spending.\nHe has dismissed speculation from opponents of Brexit such as former British Prime Minister Tony Blair that voters might change their mind about leaving the EU.\n“The revolution of 2016 is still rolling,” he told Reuters in November. “The European Union project is in deep trouble and it’s only a matter of time until it ends.”\nReporting by Guy Faulconbridge; editing by Costas Pitas\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-05T10:40:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-05T10:53:29.001+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
