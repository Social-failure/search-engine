Income from property management amounted to SEKm 2,530 (2,065), corresponding to SEK 9.26 (8.80) per share. An increase in absolute terms of 23% and in SEK/share of 5%. Changes in value on properties amounted to SEKm 4,540 (4,085) and on derivatives to SEKm 247 (82). Net income after tax for the year amounted to SEKm 5,876 (4,972), corresponding to SEK 21.51 (21.20) per share. Long term net asset value amounted to SEK 153 (133) per share. An increase of 15%. Net investments amounted to SEKm 5,613 (24,737) of which SEKm 3,595 (29,372) were acquisitions, SEKm 2,893 (2,119) new constructions, extensions and reconstructions and SEKm 875 (6,754) sales. Net lease for the year was SEKm 310 (178). The Board proposes a dividend of SEK 5.30 (5.00) per share, which is equivalent to an increase of 6%, distributed in two equal payments of SEK 2.65.\n\"The dividend tradition continues – and the Board proposes an increased dividend for the twentieth consecutive year,\" says CEO Henrik Saxborn. \"2017 became a new record year for Castellum – resulting from a strong local organization, an attractively positioned portfolio, and strong rental and real estate markets. This resulted in net leasing totalling SEKm 310 and an increase in value of SEK 4.5 billion. At year end, Castellum's real estate value amounted to SEK 81 billion, and the loan to value ratio was 47%.\"\n\"Net investments totalled SEK 5.6 billion in 2017, with projects accounting for an increasing proportion. This makes me convinced that in 2018 – with the existing portfolio – we'll have excellent opportunities to reach our goal of 10% growth in income from property management,\" Saxborn concludes.\nEnclosure: Year-end Report 2017\nThis information is information that Castellum is obliged to make public pursuant to the EU Market Abuse Regulation and the Securities Markets Act.
