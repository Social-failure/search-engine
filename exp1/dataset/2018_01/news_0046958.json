Systems are now working normally although there is some catch-up work to complete,” the central bank said in a statement.\nThe BoE expected to process payments as normal on Friday, but added that wholesale counterparty transactions may be dealt with later in the day than normal.\nThe outage did not affect the general public or the main high-speed interbank payments service, CHAPS, the BoE said.\nReporting by David Milliken; editing by Costas Pitas\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-01-26T16:21:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-26T11:50:29.006+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
