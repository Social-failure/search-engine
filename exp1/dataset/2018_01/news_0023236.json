Banesco will become part of the public banking system.”\nCabello, who is influential in the Socialist Party, does not have an official role in finance or state banking.\nVenezuela’s Information Ministry, which fields inquiries on behalf of the Ministry of Economy, Finance and Public Banks, did not immediately respond to an email seeking comment.\nReuters was unable to immediately obtain comment from Banesco or Escotet.\nLate socialist leader Hugo Chavez expanded the state’s role in the banking sector with the nationalization of Banco de Venezuela, which had been in the hands of Spain’s Grupo Santander and was previously the country’s top bank.\nVenezuela’s collapsing economic system has created inflation of 2,600 percent, according to opposition legislators, which has sharply deteriorated the value of private banks whose assets are primarily in local bolivar currency.
