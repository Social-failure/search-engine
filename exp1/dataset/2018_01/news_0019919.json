REUTERS/Kyle Grillot Sodden hillsides gave way, unleashing a torrent of mud, water, uprooted trees and boulders onto the valley below and killing people aged 3 to 89.\nThe destruction covered 30 square miles (78 square km), according to the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection, and forced the partial closure of one of California’s most celebrated coastal roads, the heavily used Highway 101.\nSlideshow (4 Images) Officials ordered residents in most of the southeastern corner of Montecito, which is east of Santa Barbara, to leave their homes for what was likely to be one or two weeks.\nMany fled to nearby Carpinteria, where local resident Tessa Nash said they were communicating via a Facebook page called Carpinteria Swap, which is usually focused on buying and selling secondhand goods.\nIn the last few days, Nash said, it has been carrying information about community-led blood drives and transportation tips.\n“We’re really joined together,” she said. “We’re affected here in Carpinteria in the sense that we’re taking these people in and a lot of people are out of work because they can’t travel. It’s a trickle down effect.”\nAdditional reporting and writing by Rich McKay in Atlanta; Editing by Louise Heavens and Jeffrey Benkoe\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-14T12:53:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-14T12:58:54.007+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
