I appreciate my wins now. To get to play another day, this itself should get you already in a different mindset coming into whoever you got to play.” \nKyrgios, who has often melted under pressure, went on to win the Brisbane title and showed considerable composure in his four-set third round victory over Jo Wilfried Tsonga. \nThe sometimes hot-headed 17th seed believes he has made considerable improvements to his game since his best previous Melbourne Park showing, a quarter-final loss to Andy Murray 2015. \n“The last couple years I feel like I haven’t been physically ready to play these long matches and back it up,” Kyrgios said. \n”I did a really good off-season this year. Physically I feel really good. Just gives me confidence in my game. \n“I know mentally I‘m a lot better, as well. Obviously getting a good start in Brisbane helped.” \nWith British surprise package Kyle Edmund and Italian Andreas Seppi facing off on Hisense Arena for the right to fill the bracket opposite them in the quarter-final draw, both players will see defeat as an opportunity lost. \nWith just one former grand slam champion remaining in the women’s draw, second seed Caroline Wozniacki and fourth seed Elina Svitolina will feel the same if they cannot get past Magdalena Rybarikova and Denisa Allertova respectively. \nOrder of play [L3N1PF04Z]", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-20T16:13:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-20T16:31:48.022+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
