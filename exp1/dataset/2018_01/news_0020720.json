Now, the former assistant secretary of state for democracy, human rights and labor is running for Congress in New Jersey’s seventh district. That district is currently represented by a Republican, Rep. Leonard Lance (R-N.J.). \n“I’m now running for Congress, and the Russia investigation is rarely the first thing people here in New Jersey talk to me about,” Malinowski wrote in his piece. “But the hopes they do raise — for good jobs, affordable health care, fair taxes, a clean environment — are all at risk if a hostile foreign power can manipulate our democratic process and even hijack our election outcomes.” \nMalinowski immigrated to the United States from Poland as a child. Before joining the Obama administration, he worked on President Bill Clinton’s National Security Council and for Human Rights Watch.

Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images \nIn his Politico Magazine piece, Malinowski offered three ways to prevent future foreign interference: Securing elections and election technology, more scrupulously keeping foreign money out of politics and combatting online propaganda. \n“Protecting our democracy shouldn’t be a partisan issue,” Malinowski wrote. “By joining ranks around such common-sense steps, Democrats and Republicans in Congress can not only protect our elections, but also combat the increasingly poisonous and polarized politics that the Russians were trying to exploit.” \nThe New Jersey seat is up for a vote during the November 2018 midterm elections. \n", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-11T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-12T04:25:02.005+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
