Analysts had expected earnings of 42 cents a share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.\nTotal net sales were nearly flat at $2.658 billion, below analysts’ expectations for $2.77 billion.\nMonsanto said it benefited from strong demand for its Intacta brand soybean seeds in South America and sales of glyphosate, the key ingredient in its popular weed killer Roundup.\nIn the United States, Monsanto faces lawsuits over crop damage last year linked to a new herbicide based on a chemical known as dicamba. The company says the product is safe and expects higher sales this year.\n“We continue to expect strong adoption of our newest technologies and improved pricing for glyphosate to be tempered by challenging global corn and soybean prices, even as demand for both continues to grow,” Grant said.\nMonsanto and Bayer have received about half the antitrust approvals necessary to merge and expect the tie-up to close early this year, Grant said.\nIn the EU, regulators are set to warn Bayer the deal may hurt competition, a person familiar with the matter said last month.\n“Everybody’s paying attention to the regulatory approval process for this merger,” said Matt Arnold, analyst for Edward Jones.\nMonsanto shares were up 0.4 percent at $117.91 on Thursday afternoon.\nReporting by Tom Polansek in Chicago and Akshara P in Bengaluru; Editing by Saumyadeb Chakrabarty and Matthew Lewis\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-04T16:42:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-04T17:03:23.011+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
