The company is considering a sale or spinoff of the unit and said on Wednesday that the process is still ongoing. \nLilly’s shares fell 4 percent to $82.52 in midday trading. CASH-PILE PLANS \nLilly said it plans to pay down about $2 billion of debt, return cash to shareholders and bolster its growth prospects through deals and partnerships as it brings home its $9 billion cash pile over the next two years. \nIt also said it expects an effective 2018 tax rate of 18 percent, down from its previous expectation of 21.5 percent. \nChief Executive David Ricks said that it would be reasonable to expect oncology to be a particular area of focus for business development this year. \n“Historically, Lilly has not been one of those companies that have done a lot of large deals like a Pfizer, or Merck or J&J,” Credit Suisse analyst Vamil Divan said. “But you’ve got a very new management team ... and maybe they’ll get a little more aggressive.” \nA possible sale of the animal health business and the windfall from new tax laws could provide the drugmaker with cash for its biggest M&A deal yet, Divan said. \nThe company posted a net loss of $1.66 billion, or $1.58 per share, for the three months ended Dec. 31, mostly due to a $1.9 billion charge due to the U.S. tax legislation. That compares with a year-ago profit of $771.8 million, or 73 cents per share. \nExcluding items, it earned $1.14 per share. Revenue rose nearly 7 percent to $6.16 billion. \nOn average, analysts had expected a profit of $1.07 per share and revenue of $5.94 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. \nSales of the recently launched Trulicity nearly doubled to $649 million in the fourth quarter, beating consensus estimates of $580 million, according to Barclays. Psoriasis drug Taltz also showed strong growth. \nIndianapolis-based Lilly raised its 2018 adjusted earnings per share guidance to $4.81 to $4.91, just over a month after forecasting a range of $4.60-$4.70.
