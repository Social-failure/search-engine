VW’s premium divisions, Audi and Porsche, had already posted record 2017 deliveries last week.\nNew Volkswagen vehicles are seen at a parking lot of the VW factory in Sao Bernardo do Campo, Brazil January 5, 2017. REUTERS/Paulo Whitaker Toyota said last month it expected to sell 10.35 million cars worldwide in 2017 across its Toyota, Lexus, Daihatsu and Hino brands, up 2 percent from 2016, and 10.5 million this year. VW is due to announce 2017 deliveries for the group as a whole on Jan. 17.\nIn China, Volkswagen’s largest market, accounting for about half the core brand’s deliveries, sales rose 5.9 percent last year to 3.18 million cars. In the United States, they were up 5.2 percent to 339,700 cars.\nDeliveries dropped 2.5 percent to 1.43 million cars in the higher-margin, but diesel-heavy western European market as customers reacted to a backlash against diesel technology in the wake of Volkswagen’s emissions trickery.\nSales of the VW brand, which is pushing a turnaround plan to revive profits, may continue to outpace rivals, according to industry forecaster IHS Markit.\nDeliveries of VW passenger cars and light commercial vehicles could increase 14.6 percent to 7.75 million units by 2025 from 6.76 million last year, IHS data indicated.\nThat compares with gains of 11.6 percent to 9.65 million at Toyota and 3.7 percent to 5.84 million at Ford.\nReporting by Andreas Cremer; Editing by Kevin Liffey and Sherry Jacob-Phillips\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-15T07:09:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-15T07:39:06.002+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
