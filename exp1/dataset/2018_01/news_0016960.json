By late afternoon they had recovered to $11.80, a drop of 2.9%. \nAMD on Jan. 3 also said that its chips were vulnerable to one variant of the Spectre bug, but there was “near zero risk” from the second Spectre variant and vulnerability to the second variant “has not been demonstrated on AMD processors to date.” \nIn Thursday’s statement, however, AMD said the second Spectre variant “is applicable to AMD” processors and that it would issue patches for its Ryzen and EPYC processors starting this week and older chips in the coming weeks. \n“While we believe that AMD‘s processor architectures make it difficult to exploit Variant 2, we continue to work closely with the industry on this threat,” chief technology officer Mark Papermaster wrote in a blog post on Thursday wrote.
