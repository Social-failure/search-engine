Later, more shots were allegedly fired at the king’s car in the small town of Erding, some 35 km (22 miles) from Munich, prosecutors said in June. [nL8N1JJ0AV] \nAt the time, prosecutors said the king’s household had no interest in charges being brought in the case. \nThe king ascended the throne after the death in October 2016 of his father, King Bhumibol Adulyadej, who had reigned for seven decades.
