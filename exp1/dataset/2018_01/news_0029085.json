Ayoub Mohammed Ruzaiq, 11, lies in his family's hut next to a garbage dump where he collects recyclables and food near the Red Sea port city of Hodeidah, Yemen, January 09, 2018. \"We eat and drink the food that is thrown away,\" said Ayoub. \"We collect fish, meat, potatoes, onions and flour to make our own food.\" REUTERS/Abduljabbar Zeyad \nThe war has killed more than 10,000 people, crippled the economy, caused a cholera epidemic that has killed nearly 2,000 people and pushed the country to the verge of famine. \nThe Saudi-led coalition denies Houthi accusations that it targets civilians or civilian property in its operations. Riyadh sees the Houthis as a proxy militia linked to regional rival Iran. Both Iran and the Houthis deny any military cooperation. \nFatema Hassan Marouai, 53, who was driven from her home in Hodeidah by economic hardships, said that apart from picking up food thrown away by better off Yemenis, some displaced people collect metal cans and plastic bottles to sell to merchants for some cash to cover daily needs.
