He declined to say whether Akilov had expressed regret for the attack. \nOn April 7 last year, Akilov hijacked a beer truck outside a restaurant in central Stockholm and sped some 500 meters (yards) down a pedestrian street, ploughing into shoppers before crashing the truck into a department store. \nBloodied and with burns to his clothes after attempting to set off a home-made bomb, Akilov fled into a nearby subway station, leaving three dead -- including an 11 year old girl -- and a dozen injured. Two of the victims died later in hospital.

TT News Agency/Henrik Montgomery/via REUTERS \nAkilov had asked in online conversations for practical advice on building a bomb and for spiritual guidance ahead of a “martyr operation”, the charges filed with a Stockholm court alleged. \nIhrman said Akilov had pledged allegiance to Islamic State, and had tried unsuccessfully to get to Syria, but it was not clear whether he had been directly instructed to carry out his attack. \nSweden has not fought in a war in more than 200 years and is not part of NATO, but has taken part in international peacekeeping missions in places like Mali, Afghanistan, Iraq and Kosovo. \nIt has also sent 70 instructors to aid Iraqi forces in their fight against IS as part of a U.S.-led operation. \nThe trial is due to begin next month.
