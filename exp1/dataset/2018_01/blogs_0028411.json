But that doesn't mean that it should be immune to regulation, Altucher said, since \"98 percent of cryptocurrencies are scams or frauds.\"\n\"More regulation will happen, and that's a good thing,\" Altucher said. \"I don't think regulation will create downward pressure if it allows the 300 million people in the U.S. who don't own bitcoin to say, 'Oh, I need exposure to this asset class.'\"\nTech investor Jillian Manus of Structure Capital told CNBC on Tuesday that some cryptocurrency trends, such as initial coin offerings, could be \"very dangerous,\" like \"the Wild West without a sheriff.\" But she, like Altucher, praised more innovative uses of the underlying technologies.\nAltucher said he owns bitcoin and plans to continue buying tokens of the decentralized digital payment platform.

Wells Fargo Securities' Christopher Harvey told CNBC this week that the cryptocurrency market was \"froth\"-y, and a sell-off was not a matter of if , but when.\nBut Altucher speculated that as regulation clears up the ambiguity in bitcoin, more investors will feel comfortable buying it.\n\"This is a global phenomenon,\" Altucher said.\nWATCH: Digital currency has real value — Here's why\nshow chapters Digital currency has real value — Here’s why 11:13 AM ET Tue, 16 Jan 2018 | 05:51 Disclaimer", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-17T19:46:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-17T19:56:30.016+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
