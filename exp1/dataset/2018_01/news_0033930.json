He said it was time countries took firmer measures to ensure maritime stability.\n“We must be willing to take the tough decisions to ensure the Indo-Pacific region and the Indian Ocean remain free, open and prosperous,” he said. “This requires like-minded nations to develop capacities, leverage each other’s capabilities.”\nHarris had earlier proposed joint patrols with the Indian navy in the Indian Ocean. New Delhi, worried about a backlash from China, said no such actions were planned.\nBut India has begun holding trilateral naval exercises with the U.S. and Japan that military experts say could eventually include Australia as well.\nReporting by Sanjeev Miglani, editing by Larry King\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-18T16:50:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-18T17:04:29.003+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
