There are fewer protests and fewer sendings-off but (referees) are continuing to make mistakes, so from that point of view, I‘m not in favour.” \nDi Francesco became the latest coach to question they use of VAR which is being tested in Serie A this season as well as other leagues around the world. \nSoccer’s rule-making body IFAB is due to decide in March whether to approve its use on a permanent basis and global soccer body FIFA wants to use it at the World Cup in Russia. \n“We fell behind in the first half following a situation that I don’t think was right, You have to assess everything in these cases,” Di Francesco added. \n“In football that’s called obstruction. If you show no interest to get the ball, it’s a foul. The worst thing is that the linesman raised his flag and he was ignored. If that wasn’t obstruction, I don’t know what is.” \nLazio coach Simone Inzaghi has said that VAR is taking the enjoyment out of the sport and Juventus boss Massimiliano Allegri commented that matches could last three or four hours if referees did not change the way they used it.
