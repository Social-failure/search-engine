Some analysts expect peak Hemlibra sales of more than $4 billion a year. \n“Hemlibra has been shown to effectively reduce the frequency of bleeds compared to currently available medicines,” Roche Chief Medical Officer Sandra Horning said in a statement. “With once-weekly administration by injection under the skin, it could also greatly reduce the treatment administration burden.” \nRoche’s new entry into the hemophilia space has not been without opposition, however. Rival Shire, maker of treatments that Hemlibra could replace, has gone to court claiming patent infringement, something Roche disputes. \nRoche aims to expand use of Hemlibra to patients who have not yet developed resistance. If successful, the move could put significantly more pressure on Shire’s business with treatments to promote clotting.
