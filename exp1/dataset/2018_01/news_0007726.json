But a federal appeals court in January 2016 overturned their convictions after finding that evidence was improperly excluded from the trial. \nGluk had been serving a prison sentence of 10 years when the appeals court overturned his conviction. He is expected, as part of his new sentence of 50 months in prison, to receive credit for the 13 months that his lawyers said he had already served. \nSparks ordered Gluk to pay a $50,000 fine and to forfeit $677,804, the Justice Department said. A lawyer for Gluk did not respond to a request for comment. \nProsecutors said Baker and Gluk, along with others, schemed from 2005 to 2009 to prop up ArthroCareâ€™s stock price by artificially inflating sales and revenue through a series of transactions with distributors. \nTwo other ex-ArthroCare executives, John Raffle and David Applegate, pleaded guilty to felonies in 2013 stemming from their involvement in the scheme. They were sentenced to prison terms of 80 months and 60 months. \nArthroCare agreed in January 2014 to pay a $30 million penalty and enter a deferred prosecution agreement to end a Justice Department probe. \nThe Austin-based company was acquired later that year by British medical equipment company Smith & Nephew Plc ( SN.L ) in a $1.7 billion deal. \nThe case is U.S. v. Baker, et al, U.S. District Court, Western District of Texas, No. 13-cr-346.
