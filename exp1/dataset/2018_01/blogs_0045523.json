That's why Trump's decision to attend was a surprise, given the populist fervor that swept him into office.\nThe remarks by Mnuchin and Ross were the first by members of Trump's delegation at Davos and could foreshadow what Trump will say in his much-anticipated speech.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-24T12:51:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-24T12:51:12.008+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
