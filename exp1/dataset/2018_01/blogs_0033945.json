This rule is unethical and dangerously undermines public health.\"\nDr. Ben Brown, an OB-GYN in Chicago and a fellow with Physicians for Reproductive Health, said the proposed rule could have a negative effect on patients, by leading to unnecessary delays in urgent care needs.\n\"And that causes harm,\" Brown told CNBC. \nThe doctor said that as a Quaker, he is sensitive to the moral concerns of his fellow health-care workers.\nBut Brown also said, \"I'm a doctor because I'm a Christian.\"\n\"While it is absolutely important to respect the diversity of beliefs among providers, our basic job is to serve these patients and meet their basic needs,\" he said. \"Imposing one's beliefs on someone else is contrary to that value.\"\n\"The important thing is that the patients get the care that they need.\"\nOn Sunday, an undocumented teenage girl who had been in federal custody and whose desire for an abortion was being thwarted by HHS was released into the care of a sponsor.\nThe girl, known in court papers as \"Jane Moe,\" was the fourth pregnant undocumented teen publicly known to have sued HHS with the assistance of the American Civil Liberties Union over a new Trump administration policy that bars federal shelters from helping women in getting an abortion.\nIt is not known if Jane Moe has since obtained an abortion, but the other three girls have done so.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-17T20:22:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-17T20:35:28.036+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
