The company said the sector was expected to grow at around 6 percent annually in the period. \nIn recent years falling oil prices, the slowdown in emerging markets and cuts in state defence budgets have dampened demand for military equipment, hurting Leonardo’s business. \nBroker UBS said the mid-term targets were in line with its expectations but said the recovery would be loaded towards later in the period. \nAsked why the plan was conservative in the short term, Profumo said the strategy aimed to deliver sustainable growth in the long term. \nThe 60-year-old executive, who previously headed Italy’s biggest bank UniCredit, said the group would press ahead with “strict cost control ... and a strengthening of its capital structure” to secure an investment grade rating. \nRatings agency Fitch upgraded Leonardo’s senior unsecured debt to investment grade in October, but ratings from Standard & Poor’s and Moody’s are still one notch below. The group said it intended to reduce its gross debt, which was a little more than 4 billion euros at the end of September last year, by about 20 percent by 2020. \nIt said it had taken action to address the short-term issues at its helicopter unit, adding these were not structural. It said there were opportunities to improve the business in the civil sector.
