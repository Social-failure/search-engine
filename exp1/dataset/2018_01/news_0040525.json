It is designed to complement the U.S. Commerce Department’s durable goods orders report, which it typically precedes by a few days. \nELFA’s index is based on a survey of 25 members that include Bank of America Corp ( BAC.N ), BB&T Corp ( BBT.N ), CIT Group Inc ( CIT.N ) and the financing affiliates or units of Caterpillar Inc ( CAT.N ), Deere & Co ( DE.N ), Verizon Communications Inc ( VZ.N ), Siemens AG ( SIEGn.DE ), Canon Inc ( 7751.T ) and Volvo AB ( VOLVb.ST ). \nThe Equipment Leasing & Finance Foundation, ELFA’s non-profit affiliate, said its confidence index for January was at an all-time high of 75.3, up from 69.4 in December. \nA reading of above 50 indicates a positive outlook.
