The Cboe Volatility index ( VIX ), widely considered the best gauge of fear in the market, closed below 10 more than 50 times last year. It also failed to break above 20 at any time in 2017.\nEquities have been under pressure during the past two days as fears of rising inflation pushed the U.S. 10-year yield to its highest levels since 2014, thus giving investors pause about the market's rally.\nSeveral strategists have also begun calling for a pullback. Last week, Stifel strategist Barry Bannister predicted the Federal Reserve will cause a correction this quarter as it leads other central banks into tighter monetary policy. Meanwhile, a Goldman Sachs strategist said Monday there is a \" high probability \" the stock market experiences a correction in the coming months.\nEquities had kicked off 2018 with a bang. The S&P 500 had risen 7.5 percent prior to this week's pullback.
