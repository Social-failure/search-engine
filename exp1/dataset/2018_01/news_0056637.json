Schuchat is a former acting CDC director. \nPolitico reported on Tuesday that Fitzgerald had traded in tobacco and healthcare stocks a month after Congress confirmed her appointment by Trump in July. Her financial disclosure report, released by Politico, showed she made purchases last August in shares of Japan Tobacco Inc, Merck & Co Inc, Humana Inc as well as ADRs of German drugmaker Bayer AG.

Murray said Fitzgerald’s conflicts had forced her to send deputies to testify at congressional hearings on the opioid crisis. \nMurray said she hoped the newly confirmed HHS Secretary Alex Azar would encourage the president to choose a new director ”who is truly prepared to focus on families and communities.” \nLast September, Trump’s first HHS secretary, former U.S. Representative Tom Price, resigned over his use of expensive taxpayer-funded private charter jets for government travel. \nU.S. Representative Rosa DeLauro, ranking Democrat on the House appropriations subcommittee responsible for CDC funding, said Fitzgerald’s resignation “follows the pattern of Trump’s appointees, who put their own personal and financial interests ahead of the American people‘s.” Reporting by Julie Steenhuysen in Chicago; additional reporting by Ankur Banerjee in Bengaluru and Roberta Rampton in Washington; Editing by Jeffrey Benkoe and Howard Goller", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-31T23:07:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-31T23:49:17.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
