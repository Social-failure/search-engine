In the more marginal areas crops are already wilting,” Gilpin said.\nThe U.S. Famine Early Warning Systems Network (Fewsnet) in its January report said the poor rains were expected to affect the availability of seasonal green crops for consumption.\n“The high likelihood of below-average rains for the remainder of the season is likely to significantly reduce crop yields and harvests across most parts of the country,” said Fewsnet.\nGilpin said the tobacco crop, which reaps more than $800 million annually and is the economy’s second-biggest export earner, was had not been affected yet because it was more resistant to dry spells.\nIn 2016 Zimbabwe suffered a severe drought, which left more than four million people facing hunger.\nNew President Emmerson Mnangagwa who came to power in November after a de facto military coup that forced Robert Mugabe to resign has said reviving the agriculture sector is one of his main goals to ensure food security in future.\nAgriculture has been starved of large-scale investment since Mugabe’s government began its seizure of white-owned farms in 2000, but Mnangagwa has said he welcomes investment, including from the white farmers whom he has promised to compensate.\nDavid Marapira, the deputy minister of agriculture, said although rains had been sparse, the country was holding enough grains in its reserves after the state grain agency bought excess maize from farmers. He said farmers were also holding maize reserves from last year.\n“Yes the rains have not been adequate so far but we do have in our strategic reserves more than 500,000 tonnes of maize that will last the country for a year,” said Marapira.\nPatchy rains and pest outbreaks have also threatened maize production in Zambia and Malawi, while Reuters journalists who traveled to Lesotho this weekend saw fields of stunted maize that looked in poor condition.\nEditing by Ed Stoddard and David Evans\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-01-29T22:33:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-30T03:17:26.004+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
