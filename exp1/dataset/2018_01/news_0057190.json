But you’ve got a very new management team ... and maybe they’ll get a little more aggressive,” Credit Suisse analyst Vamil Divan said. \nLilly is betting on newer growth drivers such as Trulicity and Taltz as older drugs Humalog and Cialis face rising competition. \nSales of the recently launched diabetes drug Trulicity nearly doubled to $649 million in the fourth quarter, beating consensus estimates of $580 million, according to Barclays. \nRevenue from psoriasis treatment Taltz, which Lilly expects to launch in a new indication, nearly tripled to $172.5 million in the quarter, but slightly missed consensus of $179 million. \nSales in Lilly’s Elanco animal health business, which the drugmaker is considering selling, fell about 6 percent to $790.9 million. Barclays consensus revenue estimate was $838 million. \nAdditional cash from a possible sale of the business and the new tax laws could provide the drugmaker with cash for its biggest M&A deal yet, Divan said. \nIndianapolis-based Lilly raised its 2018 adjusted earnings per share guidance to $4.81 to $4.91, just over a month after forecasting a range of $4.60-$4.70. \nHowever, the company incurred $1.94 billion in charge in the quarter related to the overhaul of the U.S. tax code. \nThe company also recognized asset impairment, restructuring and other charges of $1 billion, primarily due to its cost-reduction initiative, including the U.S. voluntary early retirement program. \nThe charges pushed Lilly to a net loss of $1.66 billion, or $1.58 per share, for the three months ended Dec. 31, compared with a year-ago profit of $771.8 million, or 73 cents per share. \nExcluding items, it earned $1.14 per share. \nRevenue rose nearly 7 percent to $6.16 billion. \nAnalysts on average had expected a profit of $1.07 per share and revenue of $5.94 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.
