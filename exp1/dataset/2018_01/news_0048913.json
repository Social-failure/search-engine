Asked after the match about his future, the striker said: ”I don’t know, it’s better you speak to Conte. \n“When I have a chance I want to take it. I work every day and today I am very happy here.” Slideshow (6 Images) \nMarcus Alonso added Chelsea’s third just after the interval with a superb 72nd-minute freekick over the wall. \nWhile Chelsea have been in the fifth round 18 times in the past 20 years, Newcastle last reached that stage in 2006. \nCardiff City host Manchester City in the day’s other game later on Sunday.
