But I think we are finally close to the target,” he said.\nWriting by Noah Barkin, editing Mark Bendeich\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-01-26T22:37:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-27T00:08:22.003+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
