If found guilty, the two companies risk multi-million euro fines. \nApple and Samsung are suspected of orchestrating “a general commercial policy taking advantage of the lack of certain components to curb the performance times of their products and induce consumers to buy new versions”, the watchdog said. \nThere was no immediate comment from either company.

It has also said it would change its software to show users whether their phone batteries were working well. \nSamsung’s software updates for its phones have not previously been questioned. \nLawsuits have been filed against Apple in California, New York and Illinois alleging the company defrauded users by slowing down devices without warning. \nThe company also faces a legal complaint in France, where so-called “planned obsolescence” is against the law.
