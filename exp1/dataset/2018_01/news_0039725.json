Its total worldwide gross is $768 million. The movie’s production budget was about $130 million, but thanks to tax credits in Hawaii and Georgia, where it was shot, it cost Sony just under $100 million, meaning it should be very profitable. \nIts success is particularly notable because Sony opened “Jumanji” in a spot many studios considered suicide for a film with global blockbuster aspirations: One week after a new “Star Wars” installment. “Jumanji” opened Dec. 20 and grossed $36.2 million its first weekend in the U.S. and Canada, far behind $71.6 million for Walt Disney Co.’s DIS, +0.15% “Star Wars: The Last Jedi,” which made its debut the prior week. But by the next weekend, strong word-of-mouth pushed “Jumanji” into a near-tie with “Star Wars” and since then, its ticket sales have declined slower, making it No. 1.
