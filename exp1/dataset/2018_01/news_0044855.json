Fourth quarter 2016 net income would have been $738,000, or $.23 per share when excluding merger-related expenses for the merger with Capital Directions, Inc., the holding company for Mason State Bank.\nNet income for the year ended December 31, 2017 was $3,419,000, or $.86 per share compared to net income for 2016 of $2,598,000, or $.80 per share.\nTotal assets were $526.4 million at December 31, 2017 compared to $400.4 million at December 31, 2016. Total loans grew $79 million, or 25.4% year over year. Most of the increase in total loans was related to the merger with Mason State Bank with the remainder related to commercial loan growth. The lending environment remains very competitive in our markets. We are continuing our efforts to increase loan volume while maintaining our credit quality standards.\nFor the quarter ended December 31, 2017, net interest income increased $1,131,000, or 39.3% primarily due to the growth in loans mentioned above as compared to the December 31, 2016 quarter. In addition, $252,000 of interest income was recorded related to the payoff of several non-accrual and purchased-impaired loans. The provision for loan losses decreased $31,000 due to a lower trend in historical losses as well as net recoveries recorded for the year. Non-interest income increased $79,000, or 21.9% for the quarter ended December 31, 2017 compared to December 31, 2016 quarter primarily due to combining both banks. Operating expenses increased by $165,000, or 7% mostly due to combining both banks.\nCommercial National Financial Corporation operates through a single subsidiary bank, Commercial Bank.
