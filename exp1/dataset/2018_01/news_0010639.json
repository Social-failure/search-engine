The Gulf carriers have denied the subsidy claims. \nPowers will head the finances of Etihad Aviation Group (EAG) which oversees Etihad Airways, engineering, airport, travel services units, and its investments in other carriers. \n“The Etihad Aviation Group Board believes Mark and the wider finance team will play a pivotal role in helping to guide Etihad onto the next stage of its development,” said Group CEO Tony Douglas, who joined the airline this month. \nEtihad reported a $1.9 billion loss for 2016, its first since 2010. Like fellow Gulf carriers Emirates and Qatar Airways, it has had to battle overcapacity, security concerns and a drop in regional business travel in recent years. \nEtihad cut, or announced it was dropping, several routes last year including to U.S. cities San Francisco and Dallas. \nOn Monday, Etihad signed an aviation security pact with Emirates, the first such cooperation agreement between the two UAE-based rivals. \nEtihad has also been hampered by stakes it has bought in more than half a dozen airlines. \nKey investments Air Berlin and Italy’s Alitalia both entered administration last year. \nEtihad has sold its holding in Swiss-based regional airline Darwin but still has stakes in Virgin Australia, Air Seychelles, Air Serbia, and India’s Jet Airways . \nPowers takes over from Ricky Thirion who held the position in an acting capacity since July 1. \nThirion will resume his role as group treasurer, Etihad said.
