Sales at the chain continued to drop, albeit by less, in the fourth quarter. \nSince returning, in 2014, at the helm of the group, Luxottica Chairman Leonardo Del Vecchio has overseen a restructuring of the business he founded as well as a string of management changes. Luxottica lost in December its fourth CEO in three years. $1 = 0.8095 euros Editing by David Evans", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-29T19:52:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-29T20:07:30.012+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
