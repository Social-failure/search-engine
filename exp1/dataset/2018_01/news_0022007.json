That accounted for nearly a third of the total U.S. export volume and was valued at $1.37 billion, according to the U.S. Meat Export Federation.\nReporting by Theopolis Waters; Editing by Matthew Lewis\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-01-13T08:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-13T06:44:26.002+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
