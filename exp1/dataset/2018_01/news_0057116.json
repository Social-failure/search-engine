We need to be conscious about investing in adolescent girls.”\nNigeria’s female lawmakers say more women are needed in government to support policies that affect women across the country, such as gender-based violence and maternal mortality.\nYet discrimination is a major obstacle, said Aishatu Jibril Dukku, a member of parliament from the northeast state of Gombe.\n“Being a woman is a disqualification, especially in the area where I come from,” she said. “As a contestant, I had to work twice as hard to convince my people that I can do it.”\nFemale lawmaker Nnenna Elendu-Ukeje told the Thomson Reuters Foundation last year that sexism and physical threats were scaring women away from Nigerian politics.\nReporting By Adaobi Tricia Nwaubani, Editing by Kieran Guilbert and Katy Migiro.
