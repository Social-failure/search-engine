There were also signs that the replicating virus had stimulated the immune system, with white blood cells or so-called “killer” T-cells being drawn to the tumor to attack it.\nBecause the virus only infects cancer cells and leaves healthy cells alone, patients who received the experimental treatment reported only mild side-effects such as slight flu-like symptoms.\nUntil these positive results, scientists had been doubtful about whether the virus would be able to pass into the brain because of the protective blood-brain barrier membrane.\nHowever, injecting the virus directly into the brain would be difficult and potentially dangerous.\nAlan Melcher of Britain’s Institute of Cancer Research, who also co-led the study, said the results pointed a way forward for more trials using this virus, including testing whether it can harness the immune system to super-charge the effect of existing chemotherapy and radiotherapy treatments.\n“Now we know we can get reovirus across the blood-brain barrier, we have begun clinical studies to see just how effective this viral immunotherapy can be,” he said.\nReporting by Kate Kelland; Editing by Gareth Jones\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-03T21:01:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-04T00:12:43.002+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
