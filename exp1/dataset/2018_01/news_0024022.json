POLLUTION REDUCTIONS \nThe awards jury said his project could help tackle three major problems in Yemen. By utilising organic waste that produces methane, a potent greenhouse gas, the biogas system can contribute to curbing global warming. \nIt also addresses widespread dumping of waste - the major culprit for a cholera epidemic that affected a million Yemenis in 2017. \nAnd it will supply clean fuel for rural homes in a country where more than 3 million people still cook over open fires, causing severe respiratory illness and even death. \nAfter months of experimentation, Badokhon has refined a bio-chemical catalyst that breaks down organic waste faster. Combined with specially designed fermenting chambers, the technology can double the amount of biogas produced from a set quantity of waste feed, he said. \nFifteen prototypes will first be installed in Mukalla homes free of charge, to fine-tune the final product, before it is rolled out more widely. \nBiogas is a renewable source of energy, produced when bacteria break down biodegradable material in oxygen-free chambers. \nThe fermentation produces a gas made up of 55-70 percent methane and 30-45 percent carbon dioxide. Biogas can be used in its pure form for cooking, combusted to generate lighting and heat, and refined into natural gas and transport fuel. \nBadokhon said Yemenis each produce half a kilo of organic waste per day, meaning a family has 2 to 4 kg daily feedstock for a biogas unit, which can provide two hours of cooking fuel without a catalyst - “sufficient to make lunch”. \nCattle manure, another key source of methane, can be added to household waste such as vegetable peelings, further reducing emissions, while the organic liquid fertilizer that is a by-product of the biogas process saves on chemical fertilizer costs, he added. SHORT OF POWER, CASH \nBadokhon noted that Yemen currently produces only 750 megawatts of electricity from a potential capacity of about 1,300 megawatts, most of it generated from fossil fuels. \n“You can imagine our plight,” he said, adding that he has included provisions for solar panels as part of his household unit, to power lights and cooling fans. \nIn the past five years, half of Yemen’s rural households and three-quarters in cities are estimated to have installed solar power systems, according to the World Bank. \nYet while the conflict rages on, Badokhon is concerned that the $250-$300 cost of a home biogas plant may be too high for most families. \n“It’s not easy for Yemenis in these dire times to pay this amount - people can’t afford even food,” he said. \nHe is crafting a proposal for the United Nations and others to fund the production of his units, so they could be provided free to rural families. \nLaunched in 2017 by UN Environment and polymer manufacturing company Covestro, the “Young Champions of the Earth” award also offers entrepreneurship training and mentoring to help its six regional winners kick-start their innovations.
