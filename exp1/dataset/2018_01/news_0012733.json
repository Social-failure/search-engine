Analysts do not expect PZU to make a big acquisition. \nLast year PZU shares rose 27 percent, slightly outperforming the main Warsaw stock index, while the banking sector rose by more than 35 percent. $1 = 3.5080 zlotys Reporting by Marcin Goclowski; Editing by Mark Potter", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-09T19:24:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-09T19:51:17.008+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
