Reuters was unable to independently confirm any of the allegations. \nHe is the latest of dozens of high-profile men in media, entertainment and politics that have retired, resigned or been fired in the past few months following accusations of sexual harassment or assault. \n“To bring an end to this disruption which has enveloped the Ballet and the School, I have decided that it is time for me to retire,” the Danish-born ballet dancer and choreographer wrote in the letter. \nCharles Scharf, chairman of the New York City Ballet, credited Martins with a strong performance during his tenure of more than 30 years as its ballet master-in-chief. \n“At the same time, the board takes seriously the allegations that have been made against him and we expect the independent investigation of those allegations to be completed soon,” Scharf said in a statement. \nMartins said he chose to take a leave of absence from both institutions since the investigation began. \n“I cooperated fully in the investigation and understand it will be completed shortly,” he said. “I believe its findings would have vindicated me.” \nScharf said a search for a new ballet master-in-chief will begin soon.
