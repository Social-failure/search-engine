REUTERS/Sergei Karpukhin \nSome Western firms have been advised by lawyers that the U.S. Treasury Department could, in theory, take the view this constituted financing in violation of the sanctions, according to several people involved in the discussions. \nTwo Microsoft distributors, Merlion and RRC, set out new guidelines for sales in directives referring to restrictions resulting from the new U.S. sanctions policy.
