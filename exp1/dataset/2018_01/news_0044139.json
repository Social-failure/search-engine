Diluted net earnings per share were $0.07 in the fourth quarter of 2017, compared to $0.46 in the third quarter of 2017 and $0.44 in the fourth quarter of 2016. The DTA write-down reduced fourth quarter 2017 diluted net earnings per share by approximately $0.41.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017, NCC earned $20.0 million, or $1.41 in diluted net earnings per share, compared to $17.9 million, or $1.61 per diluted share, for the year ended December 31, 2016. The DTA write-down reduced 2017 diluted net earnings per share by approximately $0.44.\nNCC’s 2017 fourth quarter and full year 2017 results include $815 thousand and $1.7 million, respectively, in after-tax merger- and conversion-related expenses, reducing diluted net earnings per share by approximately $0.05 and $0.12 for the 2017 fourth quarter and full year, respectively.\n“We are pleased to report another good year of profitability, growth and strong asset quality,” said Richard Murray, IV, President and Chief Executive Officer of the Company. “Like many companies, our fourth quarter earnings were impacted by the need to write down our deferred tax asset to reflect the December enactment of the federal tax bill, but we were pleased with our overall operating performance. We are also encouraged about the positive impact that the tax bill is expected to have on our profitability in 2018.”\n“With the January 1, 2018 closing of our acquisition of FirstAtlantic Financial Holdings, Inc., we added some great bankers operating in an excellent market,” continued Murray. “We are excited about our future with Mitch Hunt and the FirstAtlantic family. As always, I remind myself and all of our team that our future success is dependent upon our continued focus on the Company’s core values of asset quality, risk management, growth, candor, and accountability, while maintaining an appropriate sense of humility.”\nSeveral important measures from the 2017 fourth quarter and full year are as follows:\nNet Interest Margin (taxable equivalent) of 4.63% for the fourth quarter of 2017 and 4.44% for the year ended December 31, 2017. The fourth quarter 2017 margin increased 0.05% compared to 4.58% reported for the third quarter of 2017, and increased 0.64% compared to 3.99% reported for the fourth quarter of 2016. For the year ended December 31, 2017, the margin increased by 0.29% compared to the year ended December 31, 2016.\nReturn on Average Assets (“ROAA”) of 0.15% for the fourth quarter of 2017, compared to 1.05% for the fourth quarter of 2016. For the year, ROAA was 0.81%, compared to 1.00% in 2016. The 2017 ROAA figures were negatively impacted by the DTA write-down.\nReturn on Average Equity (“ROAE”) of 0.99% for the fourth quarter of 2017, compared to 8.33% for the fourth quarter of 2016. For the year, ROAE was 5.65%, compared to 7.89% in 2016. The 2017 ROAE figures were negatively impacted by the DTA write-down.\nReturn on Average Tangible Common Equity (“ROATCE”) of 1.41% for the fourth quarter of 2017 and 8.10% for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to 10.78% for the fourth quarter of 2016 and 10.32% for the year ended December 31, 2016. The 2017 ROATCE figures were negatively impacted by the DTA write-down.\nFourth quarter and full year 2017 loan growth (excluding mortgage loans held-for-sale) of $81.7 million and $652.6 million, respectively; non-acquired loans grew $106.1 million during the fourth quarter of 2017 and $379.2 million during the year ended December 31, 2017. Factored receivables declined $0.4 million during the fourth quarter of 2017 and increased $34.8 million during the year ended December 31, 2017. The full year loan growth figures for 2017 include loans acquired in the Company’s acquisitions of Private Bancshares, Inc. and Patriot Bank.\nIncrease in deposits of $188.5 million during the 2017 fourth quarter and $618.1 million during the year ended December 31, 2017. The full year deposit growth figures for 2017 include deposits acquired in the Company’s acquisitions of Private Bancshares, Inc. and Patriot Bank.\nFor the fourth quarter of 2017, mortgage production volume totaled $121.0 million, compared to $76.0 million for the fourth quarter of 2016. For the year ended December 31, 2017, mortgage production volume totaled $507.6 million, compared to $322.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The 2017 mortgage production volume benefitted from the addition of the PrivatePlus Mortgage division added in the Private Bancshares, Inc. acquisition.\nFor the fourth quarter of 2017, purchased volume in the factoring division totaled $267.2 million, compared to $187.7 million for the fourth quarter of 2016. For the year ended December 31, 2017, purchase volume totaled $1.03 billion, compared to $705.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2016.\nDecrease in non-acquired non-performing assets to $0.8 million at December 31, 2017, from $1.9 million at September 30, 2017.\nAnnualized net charge-offs of 0.14% of average loans outstanding for the fourth quarter of 2017 and 0.05% for the year ended December 31, 2017.\nProvision for loan losses of $1.5 million for the fourth quarter of 2017, compared to $0.4 million for the fourth quarter of 2016. Provision for loan losses for the year ended December 31, 2017 totaled $3.9 million, compared to $3.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2016.\nEnding tangible book value per share of $19.05.\nEnding book value per share of $27.05.\nThe Company will host a live audio webcast conference call beginning at 8:30 a.m. Central Time on January 25, 2018 to discuss earnings and operating results for the 2017 fourth quarter and full year.

A copy of the news release will also be available at the same location.\nUse of Non-GAAP Financial Measures\nSome of the financial measures presented in this press release and included in the accompanying unaudited financial statements are not measures prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (“GAAP”). These non-GAAP financial measures include tangible common equity, average tangible common equity, return on average tangible common equity, tangible book value per share, efficiency ratio and operating efficiency ratio. The Company’s management uses these non-GAAP financial measures in its analysis of the Company’s performance.\n“Tangible common equity” is defined as total shareholders’ equity less goodwill, other intangible assets and minority interest not included in intangible assets.\n“Average tangible common equity” is defined as the average of tangible common equity for the applicable period.\n“Return on average tangible common equity,” or ROATCE, is defined as net income available to common shareholders divided by average tangible common equity.\n“Tangible book value per share” is defined as tangible common equity divided by total common shares outstanding. This measure is important to investors interested in changes from period to period in book value per share, exclusive of changes in intangible assets.\nThe Company’s management believes that these measures, each of which utilizes the concept of tangible common equity rather than total common equity, provide useful information to management and investors because they eliminate the impact of goodwill and other intangible assets created in an acquisition. These measures are commonly used by investors when assessing financial institutions.\n“Efficiency ratio” is defined as noninterest expense divided by operating revenue (which is equal to net interest income plus noninterest income), excluding one-time gains and losses on sales of securities. This measure is important to investors looking for a measure of efficiency in productivity based on the amount of revenue generated for each dollar spent.\n“Operating efficiency ratio” is defined as noninterest expense divided by operating revenue, excluding one-time gains and losses on sales of securities and one-time gains and expenses related to merger and acquisition activities. This measure is important to investors looking for a measure of efficiency in productivity based on the amount of revenue generated for each dollar spent.\nThe Company’s management believes that these non-GAAP financial measures provide useful information to management and investors that is supplementary to the Company’s financial condition, results of operations and cash flows computed in accordance with GAAP; however, the Company acknowledges that the non-GAAP financial measures have a number of limitations. As such, the Company cautions readers that these disclosures should not be viewed as a substitute for results determined in accordance with GAAP, and that these disclosures are not necessarily comparable to non-GAAP financial measures that other companies use. These non-GAAP financial measures exclude various items detailed in the attached “Non-GAAP Reconciliation.”\nAbout National Commerce Corporation\nNational Commerce Corporation (Nasdaq:NCOM), a Delaware corporation, is a financial holding company headquartered in Birmingham, Alabama.
