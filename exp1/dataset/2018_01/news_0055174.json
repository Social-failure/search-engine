The 2016 rule brought e-cigarettes, cigars, pipe tobacco and hookah tobacco in line with existing rules for cigarettes and smokeless tobacco. \nAs a result, companies are now required to submit e-cigarettes and other newer tobacco products for government approval, list their ingredients and place health warnings on packages and in advertisements. \nE-cigarettes heat nicotine-laced liquid into vapor but do not contain tobacco. \nBig tobacco companies such as Altria Group Inc see vaping products as a promising business line and have lobbied alongside their smaller e-cigarette counterparts against the rule. \nThe vape shops that filed the lawsuits announced on Tuesday contend that they were being subjected to burdensome rules that had hurt their ability to attract customers and restricted how that could advertise their businesses.
