Umbrellas became a symbol of defiance after protesters used them as shields against police pepper spray and batons.\nHigh Court Judge Andrew Chan said that even though Wong only stayed in the protest area for 90 minutes on the day in question, “his involvement in obstructing the clearance operation was deep and extensive. He played a leading role on that day”.\n“In view of his overall involvement, I am of the view that the only appropriate punishment ... will be one of immediate imprisonment,” said Chan.\nAnother activist, Raphael Wong, was also jailed, while the remaining protesters, including former student leader Lester Shum, received suspended sentences.\nFormer student leader Joshua Wong reacts outside High Court before receiving his sentence in Hong Kong, China January 17, 2018.

Our determination to fight for genuine universal suffrage will not waver,” stated Raphael Wong in the courtroom before being taken away.\nLawyers for both the Wongs said they would appeal, but they were denied an immediate request for bail.\nPro-democracy activists (L-R) Lester Shum, Raphael Wong and Joshua Wong chant slogans outside High Court before receiving their sentences in Hong Kong, China January 17, 2018.

Wong chose not to fight the charge in the spirit of civil disobedience.\nWong had begun serving a six-months imprisonment sentence last August for a separate unlawful assembly charge, but he was granted bail by Hong Kong’s highest court, which heard the appeal against the sentence on Tuesday. It would decide upon the case on a later date.\nEditing by James Pomfret and Michael Perry\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-17T04:42:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-17T04:56:00.003+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
