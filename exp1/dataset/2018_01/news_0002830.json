It is projected that each aircraft participating in the network will act as an airborne repeater or router, sending and receiving broadband signals from one aircraft to the next and creating a digital information superhighway in the sky. The Company intends the network to be a high-speed broadband internet pipeline to improve coverage and connectivity. The Company does not intend to provide retail customer coverage to end users, but, instead, act as a wholesale carrier with target customers, such as internet service providers and telephone companies.\nCurrently, the world's connectivity is achieved by use of undersea cables, ground-based fiber and satellites. The Company believes that the Company's airborne digital highway may be a solution to fill the world's connectivity void. Once the network is developed and fully implemented, it may have a wide variety of applications. The Company's network, once developed, should provide low cost, high-speed connectivity to rural areas, island nations, ships at sea, oil platforms, in addition to connectivity to commercial and private aircraft in flight.\nNotice Regarding Forward-Looking Statements:\nThis release includes \"forward-looking statements\" within the meaning of the safe harbor provisions of the United", "external_links": ["http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/airborne-wireless-network-announces-appointment-of-additional-directors-and-independent-committee-members-300576178.html"], "published": "2018-01-04T16:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-04T16:35:14.008+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
