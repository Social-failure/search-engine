The Dow hit an intraday all-time high for its fourth record of the year. But it couldn't muster enough momentum to close in positive territory. \nDespite the mixed close, stocks have been ripping. The major indexes are having their strongest start to the year since 2006. \n\"Every year where we've had more than a 2 percent gain to start the year, the rest of the year has seen a return of over 10 percent,\" he said. \nHickey contends the 2017 winners, such as technology, will continue their winning streak. But another group of stocks may have a tougher time this year. \n\"The middle decile of stocks as far as performance last year are barely up this year,\" he noted â€” suggesting they're exhibiting signs of \"middle-child syndrome.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-09T15:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-09T15:20:48.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
