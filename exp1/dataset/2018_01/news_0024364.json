The administration also embarked on a series of efforts to repeal and replace much of the ACA through congressional action.\nThose efforts failed last year .\nBut as Gallup noted in a write-up of its survey's latest findings, \"media coverage of the policies to repeal and replace the healthcare law may have caused some consumers to question whether the government would enforce the penalty for not having insurance.\"\nTrump has continued to publicly disparage the law, which in October he falsely claimed did not exist anymore . He also cut back significantly on the advertising to encourage sign-ups in health plans during the recently completed enrollment period.\nOther likely causes of the 2017 rise in the uninsured rate, Gallup said, are that a number of health insurers stopped selling Obamacare individual plans through government marketplaces and that, as a result, prices increased for plans that remained on those exchanges.\n\"This may have caused some Americans, especially those who failed to qualify for federal subsidies, to forego insurance,\" Gallup's write-up said.\nAnd Gallup noted that \"it seems likely that the uninsured rate will rise further in the years ahead,\" given the effective repeal, starting in 2019, of Obamacare's requirement that most Americans have some form of health insurance or pay a fine.\nThe tax bill passed by Congress last month included that gutting of the Obamacare individual mandate. The Congressional Budget Office has estimated that 13 million more Americans would become uninsured in the next decade because of that repeal, although some analysts say the increase will be less dramatic than that.\nInsurance premiums in the individual coverage market are projected to be 10 percent higher than they otherwise would have been as a result of the mandate's repeal. Those price increases are expected to lead some people to opt out of coverage.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-16T18:37:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-16T18:46:13.027+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
