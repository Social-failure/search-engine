The case is ongoing.\n“The problem is widespread ... Most women who had undergone the procedure were seeking treatment for only minor ailments,” he told the Thomson Reuters Foundation, referring to the testimonies he gathered for the case.\nA woman cannot bear children after the removal of a uterus and the procedure is often accompanied by the removal of ovaries, which some studies have linked to early onset of osteoporosis and other serious side effects.\nAlthough India’s hysterectomy rate is much lower than in many Western countries - such as the United States where 600,000 women undergo the procedure every year - reports of unnecessary surgeries have troubled the south Asian nation for a decade.\nMany women - often poor and illiterate - are conned into surgeries by quacks masquerading as doctors or hospitals seeking compensation for treatment from the state’s funds for the poor.\n“It is a strong message to the medical fraternity and the government to strengthen regulation of private healthcare,” said S. K. Singh, a professor at Mumbai’s International Institute for Population Studies, which conducted the survey.\nWomen are also forced to go under the knife by their families who believe periods come in the way of their work. Women are easily convinced that their uterus has no use once they have had babies, campaigners say.\nThe survey found that the southern state of Telangana had one of the highest hysterectomy prevalence rates.\n“In Telangana, the most vulnerable and tribal women have been victimized,” said Bharath Bhushan, founder of the Centre for Action Research and People’s Development.\nThe charity was the first to find hundreds of tribal women in the state had undergone operations 12 years ago.\n($1 = 63.6800 Indian rupees)\nReporting by Roli Srivastava @Rolionaroll.
