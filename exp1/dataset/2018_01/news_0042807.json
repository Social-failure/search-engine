His Progressive Conservative party has so far led in the polls.\nThe party’s deputy leaders said in a separate statement that while Brown was entitled to legal defense and due process, “he cannot lead us into an election as a result of these allegations.”\nThe departure came just hours after Brown vigorously defended himself in a press conference held minutes before CTV aired the report in its 10 p.m. evening newscast. At that time he said he would report to work on Thursday.\nBrown said that he will stay on in his role as lawmaker in the Ontario legislature while working to clear his name “from these false allegations.”\nReporting by Julie Gordon in Vancouver; Editing by Toby Chopra\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-25T07:19:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-25T07:41:29.006+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
