Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer has said trying to hammer out a deal with the president was \"like negotiating with Jell-O.\" The New York Democrat has claimed that Trump has walked away from a couple of frameworks for deals, including one that put funding for the president's long-desired border wall on the table.\nThe shutdown entered its third day Monday after the Senate failed to reach a deal over the weekend. The chamber is scheduled to vote at noon on a new spending plan, which will fund the government through Feb. 8.\nTrump is scheduled to head to Davos, Switzerland, this week for the World Economic Forum, but his travel plans are still in doubt even if there is a deal to end the shutdown due to logistical concerns, Marc Short, the White House legislative affairs director, told reporters Monday.\n-CNBC's Eamon Javers contributed to this report.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-22T15:44:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-22T16:25:00.001+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
