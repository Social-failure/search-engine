A lower operating ratio shows improvement in profitability.\nOn an adjusted basis, CSX earned 64 cents per share, beating analysts’ estimate of 56 cents.\nNet income jumped to $4.14 billion, or $4.62 per share, from $458 million, or 49 cents per share, boosted by benefits from the recently enacted U.S. tax overhaul.\nReporting by Eric M.
