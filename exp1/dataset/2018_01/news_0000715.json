Medi-Span did not respond to requests to confirm the data. \nAllergan’s chief executive, Brent Saunders, in late 2016 pledged to keep price increases below 10 percent as part of what he called the company’s “Social Contract with Patients.” \nAllergan spokesman Mark Marmur said the increases will be the only ones taken on those brands in 2018, adding that discounts to various payers should bring the actual increases to consumers down to the low single digits. \nOther drugmakers raising prices include Amgen Inc, Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Inc and Horizon Pharma, according to Jefferies and Cowen. Amgen raised the price on its blockbuster rheumatoid arthritis and psoriasis drug Enbrel by 9.7 percent and Teva increased prices on its ProAir HFA and ProAir RespiClick asthma inhalers by 6 and 3 percent, respectively. \nDrug price increases are coming under more scrutiny from states. California Governor Jerry Brown in October signed legislation requiring drug manufacturers to give 60-day notice if prices are raised more than 16 percent over a two-year period. \nShares of Allergan rose 4.1 percent on Tuesday, while Teva and Horizon Pharma shares were up 0.8 percent and 2.9 percent, respectively.
