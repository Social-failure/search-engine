Of their past four games, three have been on the road.\nDuke erased a 13-point second-half hole but didn’t hold the lead for long stretches.\nVirginia shot 7-for-9 on free throws, but was 0-for-2 on a pair of front ends of 1-and-1 situations in the final 25 seconds before Guy sank both ends with 6.1 seconds left for a four-point lead.\nMarvin Bagley III’s 3-pointer for Duke with 7.4 seconds left closed the gap to 63-61. After Guy’s foul shots, Bagley’s putback at the buzzer accounted for the final score.\nDuke was 5-for-11 from the foul line as its five-game winning streak was snapped.\nBagley finished with 30 points and 14 rebounds and Wendell Carter Jr. tallied 14 points and 15 rebounds for Duke (18-3, 6-3), which was charged with 16 turnovers compared to five for the Cavaliers.\nIt was a matchup pitting a Duke team that leads the nation in scoring and a Virginia team that has the country’s best defensive numbers. The Blue Devils entered the game averaging 91.7 points per outing.\nVirginia led 60-55 before Carter made the first of two free-throw attempts at the 2:26 mark to set up the final stretch.\nAfter Jerome’s shot was blocked, Bagley dunked on a baseline move at the other end. Jerome had another chance in the last minute and drilled a dagger.\nDuke cut into a 13-point deficit with a 9-0 run early in the second half. Shortly after, a five-point possession helped the Blue Devils to a 41-39 lead.\nVirginia led 32-22 at halftime, marking the fewest points in any half this season for Duke. The Blue Devils were without a 3-point basket in the first half.\nThe contest the 33rd time in ACC history that two conference members rated in the top four faced off. Of those, 15 of the encounters have been at Cameron Indoor Stadium, where Duke fell to 11-4 in those games.\nThis was the only regular-season meeting of the season between the teams.\n-- Field Level Media\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-01-28T05:41:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-29T11:47:51.019+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
