[nL3N1PA26T] \n“If you look at 2017 and 2018 combined, the biggest change in our strategy is our focus on offline,” Manu Kumar Jain, Managing Director of Xiaomi India, told Reuters in an interview. \nXiaomi opened its first Mi Home, an Apple store-style sales and experience center, in May and already operates 17 such outlets in India. \nJain said Xiaomi is ahead of schedule on its plans to open 100 Mi Home stores by mid-2019 in India and also plans to add more preferred partner stores - multi-brand outlets that stock largely Xiaomi products. \nIn a bid to widen its user base in India, where about a third of its 1.2 billion mobile phone subscribers use smartphones, Xiaomi is looking to strengthen its network beyond online, which accounts for some 70 percent of local revenue.

Chinnappa \nIts strategy in India has so far rested on flash sales on leading homegrown e-commerce player Flipkart and U.S. tech giant Amazon.com’s Indian sites, an approach that helped Xiaomi save on expensive marketing spends and grab market share. \nJain, who declined to provide financial metrics, said Xiaomi will launch six to eight new smartphones across key price ranges in 2018.

Chinnappa \n“We want to improve on whatever we launched in 2017 and also launch and plug whatever we think are the big use cases where we are not present,” he said. \nLast year, Xiaomi launched eight smartphones priced from 4,999 Indian rupees ($78) to 32,999 rupees ($516). Samsung, by comparison, offers more than 40 smartphone models in India. \nXiaomi also plans to unveil at least one or two new smart products in 2018. It already sells airpurifiers and fitness bands in India and will likely venture into TVs, water purifiers, scooters and rice cookers in the future, Jain said. \n($1 = 63.8600 Indian rupees)", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-19T15:11:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-19T16:14:04.005+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
