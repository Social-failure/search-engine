He also noted that the stock broke above resistance at $190, which becomes support. He establishes this as a key level to watch into earnings.\nTo take advantage of the rising implied volatility, or the price of options, going into Alibaba, Gordon wants to make a bullish bet on the stock by selling a put spread. Specifically, he is selling the Feb. 2 weekly 192-strike calls and buying the Feb. 2 weekly 197-strike calls for $1.95 credit. This means that if Alibaba closes above $197 on Feb. 2 expiration, then Gordon would receive the $195 credit on the trade.\nIf Alibaba closes below $192 on Feb. 2 expiration, Gordon could lose $304. However, because Alibaba is already trading at $198.24, above the higher put strike level in Gordon's trade, he believes that the probability of the stock dropping by that much is small.\nSo far this year, Alibaba has soared about 15 percent.\nDisclaimer Vote Vote to see results Total Votes: Not a Scientific Survey.
