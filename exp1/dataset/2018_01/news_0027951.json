The four Libyan airlines operating out of Mitiga have been rushing to repair or replace aircraft that were hit by gunfire or artillery while parked there during the battle. \nFlights to evacuate or repatriate foreign migrants from Tripoli, which are mainly operated by U.N. agencies, were suspended because of Mitiga’s closure. \nTripoli has frequently been shaken by clashes between armed groups since Libya slid into chaos and violence following the overthrow of Mummar Gaddafi in 2011. Under the GNA, several large groups have expanded their power and the situation remains fragile. \nTripoli’s main international airport was badly damaged by fighting in 2014 and is still out of service. editing by John Stonestreet", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-20T15:48:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-20T16:11:01.012+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
