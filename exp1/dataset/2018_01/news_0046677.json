Revenues were $156.7 million in 2017 compared to $145.6 million in 2016.\nNet income was $672,000, or $0.02 per diluted share, for the fourth quarter of 2017, compared to $14.8 million or $0.44 per diluted share, for the fourth quarter of 2016. Net income in 2017 was $4.0 million or $0.13 per diluted share, compared to $16.2, or $0.45 per diluted share, in 2016.\nIn the fourth quarter and full year of 2016, net income per diluted share included $0.34 per share and $0.32 per share, respectively, as a result of the creation of a deferred tax asset. Non-GAAP net income excludes the effect of this non-cash deferred tax benefit.\nOn a Non-GAAP basis, net income was $3.8 million, or $0.12 per diluted share, for the fourth quarter of 2017 compared to $2.6 million, or $0.08 per diluted share, in the fourth quarter last year. Non-GAAP net income in 2017 was $12.2 million, or $0.37 per diluted share, compared to $9.4 million, or $0.26 per diluted share, in 2016.\nNon-GAAP net income excludes: (i) share-based compensation expenses; (ii) amortization expenses related to intangible assets; (iii) expenses related to deferred payments and income due to revaluation of an earn-out liability, each in connection with the acquisition of Active Communications Europe; and (iv) non-cash deferred tax benefit or expenses.

The decrease in cash and cash equivalents, long- and short-term bank deposits and long- and short-term marketable securities was the result of the use of cash for the continued repurchasing of the Company's ordinary shares pursuant to its share repurchase program.\n\"We are pleased to report strong financial results for the fourth quarter and full year 2017,\" said Shabtai Adlersberg, President and Chief Executive Officer of AudioCodes.\n\"In 2017 we executed well on our strategic goal to lead the Enterprise Voice space with voice connectivity solutions and enhanced our leadership position for coming years.

Looking forward, we expect to continue our evolution and growth in 2018, continuing our strong cash flow for the fourth year in a row.
