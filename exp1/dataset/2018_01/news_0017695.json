The hospital confirmed his death. \nA military spokeswoman said troops were searching for the suspects. \nTensions in the region have risen since U.S. President Donald Trump’s announcement on Dec 6 in which he recognized disputed Jerusalem as Israel’s capital. \nTrump’s reversal of decades of U.S. policy enraged Palestinians, who seek to create an independent state including Jerusalem, the West Bank and the Gaza Strip. \nIsrael captured those territories in the 1967 Middle East War and annexed East Jerusalem in a move not recognized internationally. It says the entire city is its eternal, indivisible capital. \nTrump’s announcement sparked protests and violent clashes in the West Bank and along the Israel-Gaza border. \nU.S.-led Peace talks between Israel and the Palestinians broke down in 2014. A bid by Trump’s administration to restart them has shown no real signs of progress. Vice President Mike Pence is due to visit the region from Jan. 20 to 23.
