This marked a reported decline of 2.6 percent, due to a lower U.S. dollar and Brazilian Real currency. On a like-for-like basis, revenues were up 1.9 percent.\nSodexo kept its forecast for organic revenue growth of between 2-4 percent and a flat organic operating margin at 6.5 percent of sales for the full year ending Aug. 31, 2018.\nThe performance at its north American education arm was impacted by fewer working days. That division handles areas such as managing school facilities and providing catering.\n$1 = 0.8368 euros Reporting by Dominique Vidalon; Editing by Sudip Kar-Gupta\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-01-11T14:05:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-12T18:21:38.020+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
