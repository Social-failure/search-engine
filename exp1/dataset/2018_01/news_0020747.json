(OTC Pink: BAYP) is pleased to announce that it has entered into negotiations to acquire a minority interest in 420skybnb.com , a cannabis lifestyle traveling accommodations platform.\nThe 420skybnb platform connects cannabis travelers with cannabis-friendly hosts, which offer short-term housing accommodations. The Company is a cannabis technology company that ultimately is focused on capitalizing on the massive cannabis tourism industry.\nAccording to a 2015 report from Colorado Tourism Office, a “survey of 3,250 tourists from Chicago, Dallas, Houston, San Diego, and other cities” showed that 8% reported visiting a recreational-use cannabis store. Interestingly enough, 85% of the tourists said that cannabis was their “primary motivator” for coming to visit Colorado.\nAs several more states continue to legalize recreational cannabis, the cannabis tourism phenomenon will continue to spread to these newly-legalized havens. California recently became a recreational market, and there are 250 million tourists coming into the California market annually. 420skybnb is the perfect platform for cannabis tourists to experience each of these states in a friendly and tolerant environment.\nSimilarly, 420skybnb supports cannabis entrepreneurs that seek to become hosts on the platform. This allows hosts to temporarily rent out their living space to other cannabis enthusiasts and earn money in exchange.\nBayport sees cannabis tourism as an overlooked segment of the overall industry. With 420skybnb’s cannabis technology platform geared towards travel and tourism, management sees the company as a natural fit within Bayport’s expanding platform ecosystem. Further details on the negotiations are expected shortly.\nFor more information on 420skybnb, check out https://420skybnb.com .\nYou can also see 420skybnb’s Apple and Android apps here:\nhttps://itunes.apple.com/us/app/420skybnb/id1239681277?mt=8\nhttps://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.skybnb.app&amp;hl=en\nAbout Bayport International Holdings, Inc.
