(NASDAQ: AZPN), the asset optimization software company, today announced financial results for its second quarter of fiscal year 2018, ended December 31, 2017.\n“AspenTech delivered solid second quarter fiscal 2018 financial results that exceeded our expectations from both a revenue and profitability perspective. We saw positive performance from owner-operator customers and growth from our Engineering and Manufacturing/Supply Chain suites,” said Antonio Pietri, President and Chief Executive Officer of AspenTech.\nPietri continued, “In addition, our APM business saw continued traction for each solution in the product suite. Our second quarter results have validated our belief that APM is a large opportunity that can greatly increase the value we deliver to our customers over time.”\nSecond Quarter Fiscal 2018 and Recent Business Highlights\nAnnual spend, which the company defines as the annualized value of all term license and maintenance contracts at the end of the quarter, was approximately $469 million at the end of the second quarter of fiscal 2018, which increased 4.2% compared to the second quarter of fiscal 2017 and 1.7% sequentially. GAAP operating margin was 43.6%, compared to 46.7% in the second quarter of fiscal 2017. Non-GAAP operating margin was 49.8%, compared to 50.8% in the second quarter of fiscal 2017. AspenTech repurchased approximately 756,000 shares of its common stock for $50.0 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2018.\nSummary of Second Quarter Fiscal Year 2018 Financial Results\nAspenTech’s total revenue of $124.9 million included:\nSubscription and software revenue was $117.7 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2018, an increase from $112.9 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2017. Services and other revenue was $7.2 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2018, compared to $7.0 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2017.\nFor the quarter ended December 31, 2017, AspenTech reported income from operations of $54.5 million, compared to income from operations of $56.1 million for the quarter ended December 31, 2016.\nNet income was $38.1 million for the quarter ended December 31, 2017, leading to net income per share of $0.52, compared to net income per share of $0.48 in the same period last fiscal year.\nNon-GAAP income from operations, which adds back the impact of stock-based compensation expense, amortization of intangibles associated with acquisitions, litigation judgments, acquisition related fees and non-capitalized acquired technology, was $62.2 million for the second quarter of fiscal 2018, compared to non-GAAP income from operations of $60.9 million in the same period last fiscal year. Non-GAAP net income was $43.0 million, or $0.59 per share, for the second quarter of fiscal 2018, compared to non-GAAP net income of $40.2 million, or $0.52 per share, in the same period last fiscal year. A reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP results is presented in the financial tables included in this press release.\nAspenTech had cash and marketable securities of $48.7 million and borrowings of $151.0 million at December 31, 2017.\nDuring the second quarter, the company generated $42.4 million in cash flow from operations and $42.2 million in free cash flow. Free cash flow is calculated as net cash provided by operating activities adjusted for the net impact of: purchases of property, equipment and leasehold improvements; capitalized computer software development costs; non-capitalized acquired technology, excess tax benefits from stock-based compensation, and other nonrecurring items, such as acquisition or litigation related payments.\nUse of Non-GAAP Financial Measures\nThis press release contains “non-GAAP financial measures” under the rules of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. Non-GAAP financial measures are not based on a comprehensive set of accounting rules or principles. This non-GAAP information supplements, and is not intended to represent a measure of performance in accordance with, disclosures required by generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP. Non-GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for or superior to, financial measures determined in accordance with GAAP. A reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP results is included in the financial tables included in this press release.\nManagement considers both GAAP and non-GAAP financial results in managing AspenTech’s business. As the result of adoption of new licensing models, management believes that a number of AspenTech’s performance indicators based on GAAP, including revenue, gross profit, operating income and net income, should be viewed in conjunction with certain non-GAAP and other business measures in assessing AspenTech’s performance, growth and financial condition. Accordingly, management utilizes a number of non-GAAP and other business metrics, including the non-GAAP metrics set forth in this press release, to track AspenTech’s business performance. None of these non-GAAP metrics should be considered as an alternative to any measure of financial performance calculated in accordance with GAAP.\nConference Call and Webcast\nAspenTech will host a conference call and webcast today, January 24, 2018, at 4:30 p.m. (Eastern Time), to discuss the company's financial results for the second quarter fiscal year 2018 as well as the company’s business outlook.\nThe live dial-in number is (866) 604-6127 or (443) 961-0460, conference ID code 6562029.

The Company has excluded the expense of the acquired technology from non-GAAP operating income to be consistent with transactions where the acquired assets were capitalized. In the six months ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, the Company has excluded payments of $0.1 million and $0.8 million, respectively, for non-capitalized acquired technology (including $0.1 million and $0.5 million, respectively, of final payments related to non-capitalized acquired technology from prior fiscal periods) from free cash flow to be consistent with the treatment of other transactions where the acquired assets were capitalized.\nView source version on businesswire.com : http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180124006118/en/\nMedia Contact\nAspenTech\nDavid Grip, +1 781-221-5273\ndavid.grip@aspentech.com\nor\nInvestor Contact\nICR\nBrian Denyeau, +1 646-277-1251\nbrian.denyeau@icrinc.com\nSource: Aspen Technology, Inc.", "external_links": ["http://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.aspentech.com%2Fcorporate%2Finvestor.cfm&esheet=51748154&newsitemid=20180124006118&lan=en-US&anchor=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.aspentech.com%2Fcorporate%2Finvestor.cfm&index=1&md5=824066fb9109902cb4121fd90ac0b4bb", "http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180124006118/en/", "http://www.aspentech.com/corporate/investor.cfm"], "published": "2018-01-25T00:05:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-25T02:36:20.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
