But the end result could be positive for the market.\n\"If we see tax reform doing better for a lot of companies, I think that you could continue to see a corresponding rise in yields along with an economic improvement,\" she said. \"That's not to say there wouldn't be pullbacks because there will be, we haven't seen one in a long time, but I think that you could see rates go easily through 3 percent.\"\nAnd that 3 percent mark, according to Yamada, would be the definitive level indicating that bonds are in a rising rate cycle.\nOn Wednesday, the 10-year Treasury yield hovered at around 2.44 percent.\nshow chapters 200 years of US interest rates in one chart 2:04 PM ET Tue, 2 Jan 2018 | 06:13 Disclaimer", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-03T21:43:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-03T20:55:38.005+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
