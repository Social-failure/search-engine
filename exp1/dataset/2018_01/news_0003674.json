The joint venture, which is majority owned by Aurora Cannabis, will focus on selling cannabis in Denmark, Sweden, Norway, Finland and Iceland, through Aurora’s German unit. \nThe newly formed company, Aurora Nordic Cannabis A/S, will set up a production facility, which can produce up to 120,000 kg of cannabis per year, Aurora said. \nAurora’s partner received its license to cultivate cannabis from Denmark’s Medicines Agency on January 1.
