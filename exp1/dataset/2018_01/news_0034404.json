Earnings growth for the quarter is forecast at 12.2 percent, according to Thomson Reuters data through Wednesday morning.\nYields on U.S. 10-year notes reached a 10-month high on Thursday after China reported fourth-quarter growth that accelerated for the first time in seven years.\nUnderlining the momentum of the world economic expansion into the back end of last year, both Chinese fourth quarter growth of 6.8 percent and December industrial output growth of 6.2 percent were ahead of expectations.\nBenchmark 10-year notes last fell 9/32 in price to yield 2.6108 percent, from 2.578 percent late on Wednesday. The data drove European counterparts higher as well, with Germany’s 10-year bond yield near a 5-1/2 month top at 0.575 percent.\nThe U.S. dollar fell as traders piled into the euro, yen, sterling and other major currencies amid worries over a possible U.S. government shutdown as lawmakers struggled to cobble together a federal budget deal.\nThe dollar was last down about 0.4 percent with the euro up 0.35 percent to $1.2227.\nRepublican lawmakers are scrambling to pass a temporary measure to keep the government open. A House vote on the funding extension is expected after 2:30 p.m. (1930 GMT).\nEditing by Bernadette Baum\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-01-19T00:39:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-19T00:51:24.014+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
