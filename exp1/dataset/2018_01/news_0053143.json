We delivered all-time highs in orders, sales, operating margin, EPS and free cash flow. Our fourth quarter adjusted EPS of $1.12 was also a record and 5 cents above the midpoint of our previous guidance, 2 cents of which was operational over-performance while 3 cents was due to a lower effective tax rate compared to our prior estimate. While I am very pleased with our financial results, I am even more encouraged with the organization's progress on our targeted organic growth initiatives. This once again enabled us to outperform the market, evidenced by our 9 percent organic growth rate for both orders and sales within the fourth quarter. In the fourth quarter we executed on our disciplined capital deployment and segmentation strategies as we sold our Faure Herman business within our Energy group, and purchased thinXXS to support our microfluidics technologies within our Scientific Fluidics & Optics group. We continue to invest in the best organic growth opportunities and remain committed to strategic M&A, shareholder dividends and opportunistically repurchasing shares. Tax Reform in the United States will help bolster our already strong financial profile by providing additional earnings, cash flow and capital availability. We will use these additional resources to drive our existing strategy to maximize profitable growth and strong returns on capital. In line with our expectations for earnings growth in 2018, and subject to Board approval, we intend to raise our dividend 15 to 18 percent which would take us to the high end of our stated goal of distributing 30 to 35 percent of earnings to our shareholders. Based on continued order strength in the fourth quarter, as well as benefits from our growth initiatives and segmentation efforts, we project approximately 5 percent organic revenue growth in 2018. Full year 2018 EPS is expected to be in the range of $4.90 to $5.10, with first quarter EPS in the range of $1.20 to $1.24. At the mid-point of our expected full year 2018 guidance, EPS is up 69 cents, or 16 percent, compared to adjusted 2017 EPS of $4.31. Approximately 60 percent of the increase is due to our organic growth and operational initiatives, while the remaining 40 percent is the result of an expected 2018 effective tax rate in the range of 22 to 23 percent.\" Andrew K. Silvernail Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Fourth Quarter 2017 Segment Highlights\nFluid & Metering Technologies\nSales of $222.1 million reflected a 7 percent increase compared to the fourth quarter of 2016 (+7 organic, -2 percent divestiture and +2 percent foreign currency translation). Operating income of $61.2 million resulted in an operating margin of 27.6 percent. Excluding $1.8 million of restructuring expenses, adjusted operating income was $63.0 million with an adjusted operating margin of 28.4 percent, a 100 basis point increase compared to the prior year period primarily due to higher volume and productivity initiatives. EBITDA of $66.7 million resulted in an EBITDA margin of 30.0 percent. Excluding $1.8 million of restructuring expenses, adjusted EBITDA of $68.5 million resulted in an adjusted EBITDA margin of 30.8 percent, a 60 basis point increase compared to the prior year period.\nHealth & Science Technologies\nSales of $208.9 million reflected an 11 percent increase compared to the fourth quarter of 2016 (+11 percent organic, -2 percent acquisition/divestiture and +2 percent foreign currency translation). Operating income of $44.9 million resulted in an operating margin of 21.5 percent. Excluding $1.7 million of restructuring expenses, adjusted operating income was $46.6 million with an adjusted operating margin of 22.3 percent, a 330 basis point increase compared to the prior year period primarily due to the $4.4 million pre-tax fair value inventory step-up charge from the SFC acquisition and higher volume. EBITDA of $56.7 million resulted in an EBITDA margin of 27.1 percent. Excluding $1.7 million of restructuring expenses, adjusted EBITDA of $58.4 million resulted in an adjusted EBITDA margin of 27.9 percent, a 210 basis point increase compared to the prior year period.\nFire & Safety/Diversified Products\nSales of $155.5 million reflected a 15 percent increase compared to the fourth quarter of 2016 (+12 percent organic and +3 percent foreign currency translation). Operating income of $41.0 million resulted in an operating margin of 26.4 percent. Excluding $0.2 million of restructuring expenses, adjusted operating income was $41.2 million with an adjusted operating margin of 26.5 percent, a 250 basis point increase compared to the prior year period primarily due to higher volume and productivity initiatives. EBITDA of $44.3 million resulted in an EBITDA margin of 28.5 percent. Excluding $0.2 million of restructuring expenses, adjusted EBITDA of $44.5 million resulted in an adjusted EBITDA margin of 28.6 percent, a 190 basis point increase compared to the prior year period.\nFor the fourth quarter of 2017, Fluid & Metering Technologies contributed 38 percent of sales, 41 percent of operating income and 40 percent of EBITDA; Health & Science Technologies accounted for 36 percent of sales, 31 percent of operating income and 34 percent of EBITDA; and Fire & Safety/Diversified Products represented 26 percent of sales, 28 percent of operating income and 26 percent of EBITDA.\nCorporate Costs\nCorporate costs, excluding the net loss (gain) on divestitures, increased to $21.2 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 from $15.5 million in the fourth quarter of 2016 as a result of higher variable and stock compensation and outside consulting costs.\nCorporate costs, excluding restructuring expenses and the net loss (gain) on divestitures, increased to $74.2 million in 2017 compared to $59.9 million in 2016 as a result of higher variable and stock compensation and outside consulting costs in 2017 and the prior year benefiting from the reversal of $4.7 million of contingent consideration.\nRestructuring Actions\nThe Company recorded $3.7 million and $8.5 million of restructuring expenses in the fourth quarter and full year 2017, respectively, as part of initiatives that support the implementation of key strategic efforts designed to facilitate long-term, sustainable growth through cost reduction actions, primarily consisting of employee reductions and facility rationalization. A portion of the restructuring expenses also relates to expenses associated with the consolidation of three facilities into our Optics Center of Excellence in Rochester, New York. The consolidation of these facilities is expected to be completed by early 2019.\nAcquisition/Divestiture\nIn October 2017, the Company divested Faure Herman, a business within the Energy group of our Fluid & Metering Technologies segment. This business, which no longer aligned with our long-term strategic objectives, was sold for cash proceeds of $21.8 million and generated a gain of $9.3 million. This business contributed approximately $14 million of revenue through its date of sale which was included in the Company’s 2017 results.\nIn December 2017, the Company acquired thinXXS, a leader in the design, manufacture and sale of microfluidic components for the life science market. The addition of thinXXS to the Company's existing Scientific Fluidics and Optics portfolio, within the Health & Science Technologies segment, provides us with a solid position as the next generation microfluidics technologies are adopted.\nTax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017\nIn December 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (Tax Reform) was enacted and lowers U.S. corporate income tax rates as of January 1, 2018, implements a territorial tax system and imposes a repatriation tax on deemed repatriated earnings of foreign subsidiaries. The estimated impact of Tax Reform was a decrease in income tax expense of $0.1 million in the fourth quarter of 2017. Although the net effect from Tax Reform was insignificant, there were several offsetting adjustments including a $40.6 million tax benefit due to the effects of the remeasurement of U.S. deferred taxes at the lower enacted corporate tax rate of 21 percent, offset by $30.2 million of expense related to repatriation taxes and $10.3 million of other tax expense due to tax planning strategies implemented in the fourth quarter of 2017 as a result of Tax Reform. These tax planning strategies will allow us increased flexibility to access our worldwide cash balances. The impact of Tax Reform may differ from this estimate due to, among other things, further refinement of the Company's calculations, changes in interpretations and assumptions the Company has made, guidance that may be issued and actions the Company may take as a result of Tax Reform.\nNon-U.S. GAAP Measures of Financial Performance\nThe Company supplements certain U.S. GAAP financial performance metrics with non-U.S. GAAP financial performance metrics in order to provide investors with better insight and increased transparency while also allowing for a more comprehensive understanding of the financial information used by management in its decision making. Reconciliations of non-U.S. GAAP financial performance metrics to their most comparable U.S. GAAP financial performance metrics are defined and presented below and should not be considered a substitute for, nor superior to, the financial data prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. There were no adjustments to U.S. GAAP financial performance metrics other than the items noted below.\nOrganic orders and sales are calculated excluding amounts from acquired or divested businesses during the first twelve months of ownership or divestiture and the impact of foreign currency translation. Adjusted operating income is calculated as operating income plus restructuring expenses plus or minus the net loss or gain on sale of businesses. Adjusted operating margin is calculated as adjusted operating income divided by net sales. Adjusted net income is calculated as net income plus restructuring expenses plus or minus the net loss or gain on sale of businesses plus the pension settlement charge, net of the statutory tax expense or benefit. EBITDA is calculated as net income plus interest expense plus provision for income taxes plus depreciation and amortization. We reconciled EBITDA to net income on a consolidated basis as we do not allocate consolidated interest expense or consolidated provision for income taxes to our segments. Adjusted EBITDA is calculated as EBITDA plus restructuring expenses plus or minus the net loss or gain on sale of businesses plus the pension settlement charge. Free cash flow is calculated as cash flow from operating activities less capital expenditures.\nTable 1: Reconciliations of the Change in Net Sales to Organic Net Sales\nFor the Quarter Ended For the Year Ended December 31, 2017 December 31, 2017 FMT HST FSDP IDEX FMT HST FSDP IDEX Change in net sales 7 % 11 % 15 % 10 % 4 % 10 % 13 % 8 % -
