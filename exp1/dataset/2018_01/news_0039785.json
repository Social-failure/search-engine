Nevertheless their names are absent from the list of potential Olympic participants.” \nThe statement added that the Russian Olympic Committee would request explanations from the IOC regarding the exclusion of “national team leaders in a number of sports”. \nKremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Moscow regretted that the three athletes were not considered eligible for Pyeongchang. \n“We have heard this saddening news in the media. If this decision has indeed been made, we regret to hear it. We hope for clarity in this situation,” Peskov told reporters on a conference call. \nAhn, who was born in South Korea, won three gold medals and a bronze at the 2006 Turin Games for his native country but was passed over for Vancouver four years later due to a knee injury and after falling out with his country’s skating union. \nThe 32-year-old switched allegiance to Russia in 2011 and went on to win three gold medals and a bronze at the 2014 Sochi Olympics. \nShipulin, 30, won bronze in the biathlon relay at Vancouver in 2014 and gold in the relay at Sochi in 2014. \nHe could not immediately be reached for comment. \nUstyugov, 25, won gold in the 30 km skiathlon and the team sprint at the 2017 world championships. \nThe IOC last week reduced the pool of Russian athletes eligible to compete at Pyeongchang to 389 from 500.
