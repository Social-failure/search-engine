This represents an increase of 4.55% from the previous dividend. The cash dividend will be payable on February 21, 2018 to stockholders of record on February 7, 2018.\nNet income for the quarter ended December 31, 2017 was $1,453,000 or $.38 per diluted share compared to $1,374,000 or $.36 per diluted share for the same quarter last year. There was a onetime adjustment to our deferred tax assets of approximately $355,000 or $.09 per diluted share in the current quarter due to the tax reform bill that was signed into law. The law changed the corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21%. The $355,000 tax adjustment was recorded as additional income tax expense.\nChief Executive Officer Ron Geib stated, “While our results were impacted by the adjustment to our deferred tax asset through income tax expense we were still able to have solid financial results this quarter. We are well positioned for the future and the Company will benefit from the tax reform on a go forward basis. We are pleased that we are able to create additional value for our stockholders by increasing the cash dividend to $.23 per share. We continue to remain focused on increasing core deposit relationships and reducing the amount of advances as they mature. Reducing our funding costs, while maintaining a portfolio of quality loans and investments, should allow us to deliver consistent, ongoing returns for our shareholders.”\nThe Company’s assets totaled $773.6 million compared to $757.3 million a year ago, and stockholders’ tangible book value increased to $18.48 per share from $17.94 a year ago.\nHarleysville Financial Corporation is traded on the OTCQX market under the symbol HARL ( http://www.otcmarkets.com ) and is the holding company for Harleysville Bank.
