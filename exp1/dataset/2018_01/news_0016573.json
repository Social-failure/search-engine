Morgan Stanley is advising the startup.\nBoxed Chief Executive Chieh Huang did not respond to an emailed request for comment. A Kroger spokeswoman said the company in general does not comment on rumor or speculation.\nForbes reported the news earlier on Friday.\nReporting By Jeffrey Dastin in San Francisco; Editing by Simon Cameron-Moore\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-13T05:43:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-13T06:01:36.092+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
