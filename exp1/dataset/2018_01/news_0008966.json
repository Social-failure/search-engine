REUTERS/Michael Kooren/File Photo \nA long-distance specialist with four Olympic medals including gold in the 10,000m in Turin in 2006, De Jong arrived in the country last May to help train their skaters. \nThe Koreans are better known for their prowess in short track, but the Dutchman is bringing his vast experience to bear on honing their technique over the longer distances. \nSouth Korea sprang a surprise when they won five medals on the long track in Vancouver, with the country finishing with 14 medals in total in 2010, their best haul at a Winter Games. \nThe hosts are targeting a total of 20 medals at next month’s Games, but De Jong is just focussing on getting the best out of his skaters. \n”They’ve got a longer short track history,“ he told Reuters from Seoul. ”Four years ago (in Sochi) they got two medals (on the long track) so it was not that good, and even in the coming Olympics it’ll be really hard to get medals. \n“I know the international level, it’s higher. I don’t want to talk about a target of how many medals we can take. First focus on good skating, even I did that in my own career.” \nMost of the skaters De Jong is working with have converted from short track and the seven-times world champion explained how they have had to unlearn years of training in a different technique to prepare for the longer runs. \n”I‘m not a transfer coach. They’re already long track skaters,“ he said. ”But you can see on the long track they have the background of short track skaters. \n“The most important part is using your bodyweight in the straights and that’s kind of new for the short track skaters because they are not (used to) skating straights.” LANGUAGE BARRIER \nDe Jong is also teaching the Koreans how to conserve energy while cornering.

In Korea they have a lot of respect. Sometimes the skaters have to tell me more information about how they feel, what they think about the training, but in their culture it’s not normal to tell. \n“It’s not about good or bad. It’s a culture thing. I don’t want to change it and I can‘t. It’s impossible to change a culture.” Reporting by Simon Jennings in Bengaluru; Editing by Peter Rutherford", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-15T15:19:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-15T15:41:39.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
