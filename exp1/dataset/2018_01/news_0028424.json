This gave Apple an illegal advantage in breach of EU state aid rules, which must now be recovered by Ireland - nothing has changed in that regard,” said the Commission spokesman.\nAn Apple logo is seen in the window of an authorised apple reseller store in Galway, Ireland August 30, 2016. REUTERS/Clodagh Kilcoyne The Commission ordered Apple to pay Ireland up to 13 billion euros ($16 billion) in August 2016 and has since taken Dublin to court over its delays in recovering the money.\nA spokesman for the Irish finance ministry also said it had no indication the U.S. tax payment would affect its recovery of the money.\n“Ireland has an obligation to recover (money) that is binding under EU law. Changes to U.S. legislation do not alter such an obligation,” the spokesman said.\nApple on Wednesday unveiled a $30 billion U.S. investment plan and said it would pay about $38 billion in foreign cash taxes.\nIt is unclear whether Apple will be able to offset the Irish tax bill against the 15.5 percent U.S. tax on offshore tax piles.\n($1 = 0.8177 euros)\nAdditional reporting by Padraic Halpin in Dublin; Editing by Mark Potter and Elaine Hardcastle\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-18T17:51:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-18T18:09:49.005+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
