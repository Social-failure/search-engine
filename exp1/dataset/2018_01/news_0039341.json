While the CSeries was included as a competitor, the E190-E2, which will enter service this year and has around 100 seats, was excluded because it had a shorter range.\nReporting By Allison Lampert; Editing by Bernadette Baum and Susan Thomas\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-24T16:56:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-24T17:13:54.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
