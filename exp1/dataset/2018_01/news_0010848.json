Prosecutors said this was illegal because Greenbridge was involved in talks to take a larger stake in Next at a higher price. \nThe maximum sentence the prosecution could have asked for was six years in prison. \nRollen took to Twitter after the verdict, writing “From Oslo with love” and posting a photo of himself pointing to a text that read “if all else fails, try common sense!” \nAs Hexagon CEO, Rollen has helped transform a sprawling conglomerate with a market value of a few billion crowns in 2000 into an $18 billion technology market leader following a stream of acquisitions and high growth. \nHexagon’s shares fell 10 percent following news of the accusations in October 2016 but the stock is up 25 percent over the last 12 months after reports last June that Hexagon had held talks on a possible sale to a U.S. or European rival. \nNorway’s white-collar crimes unit now has two weeks to decide whether to appeal the verdict to a higher court, prosecutor Marianne Bender told Reuters. \n“We’ll carefully consider the verdict and whether to file an appeal,” Bender said. \nTrading in the shares of Hexagon and Next Biometrics had ended for the day before the verdict was released.
