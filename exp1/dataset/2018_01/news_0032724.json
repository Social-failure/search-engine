This has provoked protests from unions. \nTavares told reporters during a briefing in Detroit that a hard Brexit, that results in tariffs on exports of U.K.-built vehicles would increase pressure to cut costs. He said the U.K. plant, which Peugeot took over when it acquired Opel and Vauxhall from General Motors Co( GM.N ) last year, is at efficiency levels similar to where Peugeot stood four years ago, when Tavares began his turnaround effort at the French automaker. \n“What counts is to bring (U.K.) plants to the level of cost and quality that is the same as Continental Europe,” Tavares said. \nSeparately, Tavares said he is “very open” to a potential alliance in Latin America. He was responding to a question about Ford Motor Co’s signal two days ago that it was exploring options for its money-losing Latin American business. \nTavares declined to say whether Peugeot planned to discuss a partnership with Ford ( F.N ). Asked if he had talked with Ford executives, Tavares said, “not so far.” \nTavares was in Detroit to promote Peugeot’s plans to gradually re-enter the U.S. market, starting with ride services.
