Jouf Cement was up 5.4 percent and Tabuk Cement jumped its 10 percent daily limit. \nThe sector reported weak 2017 earnings because of a slumping construction industry, but some investors expect a stronger 2018 as the government boosts spending under its budget plans. \nA Saudi securities analyst said Tabuk led the sector up in response to a media report that the government had started awarding contracts for its NEOM project to build a huge business zone in the northwest of the country. Tabuk is located close to the site of NEOM. \nThe largest Saudi bank, National Commercial Bank, jumped 2.6 percent because of a wave of buying in the final half-hour. \nAcross the whole market, however, declining stocks outnumbered gainers by 107 to 73. Petrochemical producer Saudi Kayan fell back 1.9 percent; it had surged in recent days after fourth-quarter earnings which, although they featured a net loss due to a planned shutdown of facilities for adjustments and maintenance, were seen by analysts as positive. \nThe Dubai index fell 1.3 percent as blue chip Emaar Properties sank 1.6 percent; fellow real estate firms Deyaar and DAMAC also slid. \nDubai Islamic Bank, which had tumbled 4.6 percent on Tuesday after announcing plans for a new share issue, fell a further 2.1 percent. \nThe Qatari index slid 1.3 percent on a wave of profit-taking across the board; falling stocks outnumbered gainers by 33 to seven. Qatar First Bank, the most heavily traded stock, dropped 0.7 percent. \nEgypt’s index tumbled 1.8 percent with the biggest bank, Commercial International Bank, sagging 3.0 percent. \nBut Juhayna Food Industries added 2.4 percent after saying fourth-quarter consolidated net profit jumped 141 percent on year as revenues gained 17 percent. HIGHLIGHTS \n* Index rose 0.3 percent to 7,650 points. DUBAI \n* Index fell 1.3 percent to 3,394 points. ABU DHABI \n* Index dropped 0.8 percent to 4,602 points. QATAR \n* Index lost 1.3 percent to 9,205 points. EGYPT \n* Index dropped 1.8 percent to 15,042 points. KUWAIT \n* Index added 0.4 percent to 6,688 points. BAHRAIN \n* Index edged down 0.1 percent to 1,351 points. OMAN", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-31T16:27:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-31T16:50:29.004+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
