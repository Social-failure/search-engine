In that time period, bitcoin — the biggest cryptocurrency by market cap — is up more than 1,500 percent. Ripple, meanwhile, ripped 35,000 percent last year alone.\nBut it hasn't been a smooth ride higher. Cryptocurrencies are prone to wild price swings in very short periods of time. On Monday, bitcoin and ripple fell 9.2 percent and 11.7 percent, respectively.\nVolatility is also expected to persist in the digital currency market throughout 2018. Ari Paul, chief investment officer of cryptocurrency investment firm BlockTower Capital, predicts that bitcoin will trade at both $4,000 and $30,000 at some point in 2018 . Bitcoin would have to drop nearly 74 percent from its Monday levels to reach $4,000. It would also have to rise about 100 percent to hit $30,000.\nChatter about whether bitcoin is a bubble or not also remains. Last week, Jeremy Grantham of investment management firm GMO told his clients the digital currency is a bubble that may crash soon . Grantham is known for predicting the market meltdowns of 2000 and 2007.\n\"I know that many crypto holders think that selling anything is a mistake. And it might be. Or it might not be. You just don't know,\" Wilson said in his post.\nClick here to read the full blog post.\n— CNBC's Evelyn Cheng contributed to this report.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-08T20:47:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-08T20:48:07.005+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
