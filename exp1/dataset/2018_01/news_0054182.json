(OTC Pink: IOFB) today reported financial results for the year ended December 31, 2017. Net income of $2,798,000 for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared favorably to net income of $1,430,000 for the year ended December 31, 2016. These results would have been better were it not for new federal income tax legislation, as subsequently will be explained in some detail.\nThe increase in net income year-over-year of $1,368,000 (95.7%) resulted mainly from an increase in net interest income of $576,000 and a decrease of $4,498,000 in noninterest expense. This decrease in noninterest expense year-over-year was largely the result of a loss on a legal settlement which was included in 2016 noninterest expense. Partially offsetting these improvements was an increase in provision for loan losses of $1,680,000, reduction of $506,000 in noninterest interest income (most of which was attributable to a nonrecurring insurance reimbursement recognized in 2016), and an increase of $1,520,000 in income tax expense.\nOn December 22, 2017, comprehensive new tax legislation was enacted which lowered the federal corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21%, which should assist Iowa First Bancshares in increasing future net income. However, this new law also reduced 2017 net income by over $400,000 as the Company’s net deferred income tax asset was reduced to reflect the effect of the lower future income tax rate. It is important to note that this fourth quarter 2017 additional income tax expense is a one-time, non-cash accounting charge against net income.\nAn additional factor that limited the earnings improvement that the Company otherwise would have experienced was a substantially higher provision for loan losses in 2017, rising from $660,000 in 2016 to $2,340,000 in 2017. Although the company achieved in 2017 a 1.3% increase in loan totals to reach $406,367,000, and improved its net interest margin slightly from 3.43% to 3.47%, there was an unfortunate deterioration in loan quality, primarily at the smaller of our two subsidiary banks. Net charge-offs for the Company as a percentage of gross loans rose to .48% in 2017 versus only .14% in 2016, and total nonperforming loans grew to $8,422,000 at year-end 2017 compared to $5,770,000 on December 31, 2016. Nonperforming loans are defined as accruing loans which are past due 90 days or more, plus nonaccrual loans and troubled debts which have been restructured.\nA number of actions have been taken to address the loan quality and credit administration at our subsidiary bank which has experienced most of the loan quality deterioration, including changes in policies, procedures, committee functions and board oversight, along with intensified training for loan officers and support staff.\nIowa First Bancshares Corp. maintains a strong capital position, as evidenced by its December 31, 2017 total risk-based capital ratio of 13.1%. Furthermore, the company’s earnings and cash flow provided for an increase in its dividend to shareholders of $.02 per share during 2017 to equal $1.16 per share. The board of directors declared a $.29 per common share quarterly cash dividend which was paid on January 30, 2018 to shareholders of record January 2, 2018. Iowa First Bancshares Corp. has paid a cash dividend to shareholders every year since 1989. While thinly traded, it should be noted that Iowa First’s stock price per share increased by 22% during 2017, reaching $45.00 per share at December 31, 2017.\nTotal assets at December 31, 2017 were $482,558,000, a decrease of $7,418,000 (1.5%) from year-end 2016. Gross loans outstanding increased $5,326,000 (1.3%), while total deposits decreased $3,927,000 (0.9%) year-over-year. The allowance for loan losses totaled $5,081,000 at December 31, 2017, or 1.25% of gross loans outstanding.\nIowa First Bancshares Corp. is a bank holding company headquartered in Muscatine, Iowa. The Company provides a wide array of banking and other financial services to individuals, businesses and governmental organizations through its two wholly-owned national banks located in Muscatine and Fairfield, Iowa.\nThis press release may contain forward-looking statements.
