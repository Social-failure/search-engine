The target of criticism from President Donald Trump for alleged bias, he was expected to leave in March, when he would have become eligible for retirement, but he was reportedly going to be demoted. McCabe was involved in the FBI’s investigation of Hillary Clinton’s email server. Reuters \nOligarch List \nThe U.S. Treasury Department would like you to know who the Russian “oligarchs” are, and has published a list to that effect. This isn’t a sanctions list, but rather a list of people who might find themselves on such a list at some point. After the U.S.’s decision to hold off on introducing new sanctions for now, Russian stocks rose. CNBC \nCapitec Is Viceroy’s New Target \nViceroy Research, the short seller whose targeting of Steinhoff led the South African furniture retailer to recently own up to accounting irregularities, has a new target in its sights: Capitec Bank Holdings. Viceroy suggested Capitec is a “loan shark” that might be hiding losses by refinancing loans that the customers can’t repay. Capitec says the report is “totally unfounded,” but its shares are falling. (It’s also worth noting that South Africa’s Financial Mail covered these allegations almost two years ago.) Bloomberg \nSAP buys Callidus \nSAP is spending $2.4 billion on buying U.S. sales software outfit Callidus.

Fortune Around the Water Cooler \nBrexit Scenarios \nBuzzFeed scored a peek at the U.K. government’s own analysis of various Brexit scenarios, and reports that all of them point to the country being worse off outside the European Union. Meanwhile, the Rand Corporation has modelled a variety of post-Brexit trade scenarios and comes to pretty much the same conclusion. Rand Corporation \nTesting Diesel Fumes on People and Monkeys Is Bad \nThe CEO of Volkswagen is “stunned” by reports that his company sponsored diesel emissions tests on monkeys and humans, and has pledged to get to the bottom of the matter. “Over the weekend we had to learn once more that there is still a long way ahead of us to regain lost trust,” Matthias Mueller said Monday. Fortune \nCIA’s China Fears \nCIA Director Mike Pompeo thinks Chinese interference in the West is as concerning as the subversion emanating from Russia, and Western countries should do more to counter the Beijing threat. “We can watch very focused efforts to steal American information, to infiltrate the United States with spies—with people who are going to work on behalf of the Chinese government against America,” Pompeo said in an interview. BBC \nState of the Union, Brought To You By… \nPresident Trump’s perpetual election campaign is offering donors the chance to have their names flashed on the screen during the livestream—on Trump’s website—of his State of the Union address. The honor will be available to anyone willing to stump up at least $35. Washington Post \nThis edition of CEO Daily was edited by David Meyer .
