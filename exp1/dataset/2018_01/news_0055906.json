REUTERS/Stringer \nLiu said China would continue to battle scattered coal-burning sources, a major source of uncontrolled pollution in provinces like Hebei, and would promote clean energy heating. \nThis week media reports said Hebei was forced to suspend plans to convert large numbers of coal-fired heating boilers to natural gas after winter supply shortages left thousands of homes without heat. \nHowever, Liu denied the reports, telling reporters the Hebei government would continue to pay close attention to its coal-to-gas conversion efforts. \nBeijing could adjust priorities this year and focus on vehicle pollution, Yu Jianhua, chief engineer of the capital’s environmental protection bureau, told a separate briefing on Wednesday. \nBeijing will keep up the toughest emissions curbs on industrial firms this year, not only to cut pollution but also spur industries to relocate, Yu added. \nCar emissions contribute about 40 percent of air pollution in Beijing, the government estimates. \nLiu Zhiquan, head of the ministry’s monitoring office, said China’s average PM2.5 readings from Jan. 1-28 were 64 micrograms per cubic metre, down a fifth on the year. \nConcentrations in Beijing fell 70.5 percent to 36 micrograms per cubic metre, close to the state standard of 35 micrograms. \nBut average readings in the Yangtze and Pearl river deltas rose over the month, he said, without giving details. \n(This version of the story corrects headline and first paragraph to show plan is for three years, not two) Reporting by Muyu Xu and David Stanway; Editing by Joseph Radford and Clarence Fernandez", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-31T04:34:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-31T05:10:00.010+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
