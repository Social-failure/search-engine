And if adjusted for inflation, Gates' $100 billion fortune in 1999 would be worth about $147 billion today.\nStill, of those individuals whose wealth is publicly traceable, Bezos is the richest person alive. As of Tuesday, Bezos' net worth is $104.5 billion, according to Forbes.\nAnd the self-made fortune is impressive. Bezos hasn't always been the billionaire titan he is today. He was born the son of a 16-year-old mom and deadbeat dad. And he didn't set out to be the CEO of an e-commerce juggernaut. \nPhoto by Bloomberg Amazon and Blue Origin founder Jeff Bezos \"I won the lottery with my mom. Thanks for literally everything, Mom\" Jeff Bezos was born on January 12, 1964, as Jeffrey Preston Jorgensen. His biological dad, Ted Jorgensen, met and started dating his mother, Jacklyn Gise, when they were both in high school. Jorgensen was 18 and Gise was 16 when she became pregnant. They flew to Mexico with their parents' money to get married.\nJorgensen belonged to a unicycle troupe and worked at a retail store making $1.25 an hour, so he didn't have much money. He was also \"had a habit of drinking too much,\" according to \"The Everything Store: Jeff Bezos and the Age of Amazon,\" by journalist and biographer Brad Stone . When Jeff Bezos was 17 months old, his mom divorced Jorgensen. \nIn 1968, Gise remarried Miguel Bezos, who arrived in Miami in 1962 from Cuba knowing only one word of English: \"hamburger.\" Jorgensen agreed to let Bezos adopt his son and, at 4 years old, Jeffrey Preston Jorgensen became Jeffrey Preston Bezos.\nBiographer Stone suggests that Bezos' childhood may have contributed to his obsession with success. \"It is of course unknowable whether the unusual circumstances of his birth helped to create that fecund entrepreneurial mix of intelligence, ambition, and a relentless need to prove himself. Two other technology icons, Steve Jobs and Larry Ellison, were adopted, and the experience is thought by some to have given each a powerful motivation to succeed,\" Stone writes.\nI won the lottery with my mom.

We also watched soap operas every afternoon, especially 'Days of our Lives,'\" says Bezos.\nBezos would also occasionally get to road trip with his grandparents.\n\"My grandparents belonged to a Caravan Club, a group of Airstream trailer owners who travel together around the U.S. and Canada. And every few summers, we'd join the caravan,\" Bezos says in graduation speech . \"We'd hitch up the Airstream trailer to my grandfather's car, and off we'd go, in a line with 300 other Airstream adventurers. I loved and worshipped my grandparents and I really looked forward to these trips.\"\nLaunching Amazon: \"I took the less safe path to follow my passion, and I'm proud of that choice\" Bezos got straight As in high school, was the valedictorian of his class and was accepted early admission to Princeton, according to Stone's biography. For a time in college, he thought he would be a theoretical physicist .\nBut it was years later, while working in finance in New York City that he had the idea to start Amazon.\n\"I came across the fact that Web usage was growing at 2,300 percent per year. I'd never seen or heard of anything that grew that fast, and the idea of building an online bookstore with millions of titles — something that simply couldn't exist in the physical world — was very exciting to me,\" says Bezos, in his 2010 Princeton address.\nAt the time, Bezos was just 30 and had been married for a year. \"I told my wife MacKenzie that I wanted to quit my job and go do this crazy thing that probably wouldn't work since most startups don't, and I wasn't sure what would happen after that,\" he says. \n\"After much consideration, I took the less safe path to follow my passion, and I'm proud of that choice.\" -Jeff Bezos, founder of Amazon, Blue Origin His wife told him to go for it.\n\"As a young boy, I'd been a garage inventor . I'd invented an automatic gate closer out of cement-filled tires, a solar cooker that didn't work very well out of an umbrella and tinfoil, baking-pan alarms to entrap my siblings,\" he says. \"I'd always wanted to be an inventor, and she wanted me to follow my passion.\"\nBut not everyone was on board. Bezos boss took a walk through Central Park and told Bezos that, while it sounded like a \"really good idea,\" it would be an even better idea for somebody who didn't already have a good career.\n\"That logic made some sense to me, and he convinced me to think about it for 48 hours before making a final decision,\" says Bezos . \"Seen in that light, it really was a difficult choice, but ultimately, I decided I had to give it a shot. I didn't think I'd regret trying and failing. And I suspected I would always be haunted by a decision to not try at all.\n\"After much consideration, I took the less safe path to follow my passion, and I'm proud of that choice.\"\nThe early days of Amazon: \"I thought maybe one day we would be able to afford a forklift\" When Amazon first started, it sold only books. Bezos would drive the packages to the post office himself in his 1987 Chevy Blazer . \"I thought maybe one day we would be able to afford a forklift,\" Bezos tells Charlie Rose in a wide-ranging interview in 2016. \"And it is very, it's very, very different today.\"\nAfter books, the next items Bezos added to Amazon were music and videos. Then, he asked customers to see what else they would want to buy from the online retailer.\n\"I sent an email message out to the customer base, actually a thousand randomly selected customers, and I said, besides books, music and video, what would you like to see us sell? And the list came back incredibly long,\" explains Bezos. \n\"It was basically just whatever the person had on their mind right now,\" says Bezos, and that sparked an idea.\nshow chapters Here's what makes up the Jeff Bezos empire      12:48 PM ET Thu, 29 June 2017 | 01:05 \"One of customers said, 'I wish you sold windshield wipers because I need windshield wipers for my car.' A light kind of went on in my head. You know, people — people will want to use this new fangled e-commerce way of shopping for everything,\" Bezos says to Rose .\n\"People are very convenience-motivated,\" says Bezos. \"So that really started the kind of the expansion into all categories, consumer electronics, and then apparel, and so on.\"\nExpand he did. Today, Amazon sells almost everything. From toilet paper to groceries to electronics to fashion to furniture.\nWhen Bezos enters a new product category, he is not intimidated by a lack of expertise.\n\"I am never disappointed when we're not good at something be", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-09T20:15:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-09T20:34:03.055+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
