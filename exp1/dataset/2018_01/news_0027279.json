In the 2016/17 crop year (October/September), cocoa grinding in Ivory Coast was 16 percent higher than the previous season.\nOn Monday, the fourth-quarter grind in Europe was reported rising 4.4 percent to 353,286 tonnes, the biggest for the October-to-December period in data going back to 1999. For 2017, European cocoa grindings reached a six-year high at 1.38 million tonnes.\nThe nine companies that took part in the North American survey are: Barry Callebaut AG, Blommer Chocolate Co, Cargill Cocoa & Chocolate Co, ECOM, Ghirardelli Chocolate Co, Guittard Chocolate Co, Hershey Co, Mars Wrigley Confectionery, and Swiss food group Nestle SA.\nNestle announced this week that it agreed to sell its U.S. confectionery business to Italy’s Ferrero.
