( bit.ly/2CJpiyw )\nThat figure excludes resource potential from western and central areas of the U.S. Gulf of Mexico, but includes the eastern region, she said.\nHowever, the drilling proposal has since faced resistance from various quarters. On Tuesday, President Donald Trump’s administration said it would not allow drilling off the coast of Florida after urging from the state’s governor.\n“The resource potential in the basins in the direct proximity to Florida, together may hold about 1 billion boe to 1.5 billion boe, so excluding those will not change the overall picture dramatically,” Passos told Reuters on Wednesday.\nThe offshore sector has been overshadowed in the past few years by the shale revolution in the United States, with investors and drillers pumping the lion’s share of their resources into the Permian and other inland oil basins.\nIn 2017, companies in the U.S. directed over 60 percent of their total investments to shale and this trend is likely to increase to about 70 percent in the coming decade, Norway-based Rystad said.\nThe consultancy said if operators utilize the full potential of the newly unlocked offshore regions, exploration activity could reach a new peak after 2030, with some 200 exploration wells drilled per year on average.\nThat would imply annual investment levels of about $15 billion, Rystad said.\nReporting by Nivedita Bhattacharjee in Bengaluru; Editing by Shounak Dasgupta\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.", "external_links": ["http://bit.ly/2CJpiyw", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-01-11T01:17:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-11T12:27:15.025+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
