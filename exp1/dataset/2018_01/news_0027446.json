It said last year it was expecting to complete the sale by the end of 2018.\nSanofi finalised in January 2017 a US$20bn asset swap deal with German firm Boehringer for its Sanofi’s Merial animal health arm.\nEditing by Christopher Mangham\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-01-18T23:09:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-19T12:13:18.022+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
