He denies any wrongdoing. \nZeman accepted Babis’s resignation on Wednesday but then immediately asked him to form another government, giving him a political mandate to negotiate with other parties. \nThe two leaders have shelved past disputes to become political allies. Zeman had pledged to ask Babis to head another coalition, putting pressure on other parties to cooperate, while Babis and ANO endorsed Zeman in this weekend’s presidential election run-off. \nZeman said on Wednesday he would provide time for Babis to cobble together a majority in the 200-seat lower house of parliament, where ANO only holds 78 seats. \nBut he said that in case he lost this weekend’s election, he would appoint Babis as prime minister again anyway before his term ends on March 7. “There will be quite a short time for finding the necessary votes, so I will not insist on this condition,” Zeman said at a joint news briefing with Babis.
