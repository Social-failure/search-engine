Hall had been head of private equity at Teacher Retirement System of Texas before coming to Harvard.\nNarvekar, who came to Harvard in late 2016, has been restructuring how the university manages its money by letting more outsiders do the investing and shutting down its internal hedge funds. As part of the changes, Harvard said in early 2017 that it would lay off roughly half of Harvard Management Company’s 230 employees.\nReporting by Svea Herbst-Bayliss; Editing by Susan Thomas\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-11T00:27:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-11T00:49:32.007+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
