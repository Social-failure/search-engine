This quarter we have mainly seen increased demand from larger corporations. We see more optimism among small and medium sized companies, but so far they have not increased their capital needs significantly. We think that will come in the coming quarter\n** ”We are definitively open to new business, we are sufficiently capitalised\n** ”The Norwegian economy is in a positive development...Export companies benefit from the weak currency at the same time as oil related business makes a comeback, so it’s going in the right direction and we are a mirror of that\n** ”We expect the housing market to level off before summer, and housing prices may even rise in the second half of the year ... we see a positive underlying sentiment which contributes to growth in mortgage demand\n** ”The mortgage competition is tough, and there is a certain decline in margins, but that’s offset by higher lending growth, which gives a positive development for the overall interest income.
