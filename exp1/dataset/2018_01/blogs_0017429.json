Congress enacted the law in 2008. The bill to extend it must still pass the Senate, but few senators appear to want major changes to the spying law. New York Times \nFacebook makes major changes to its News Feed. \nProfessional publishers out, personal connections in—mostly, anyway. The adjustment to the content filter on the social network’s News Feed component is part of a larger effort to return to prioritizing users’ interactions with each other, rather than with news and other unpaid content created by companies. Reuters \nFiat Chrysler moves some production from Mexico to Michigan. \nThe automaker will invest $1 billion to move Ram heavy duty trucks, which are a profitable business, from Saltillo, Mexico to Warren, Mich. The move gives FCA a hedge against disruption from a possible U.S. pullout of NAFTA. Wall Street Journal \nDonald Trump really steps in it. \nThe U.S. president reportedly asked legislators why the country should allow immigrants from “shithole” countries in Africa as he rejected a bipartisan immigration deal to strengthen border protections and extend protections against deportation for hundreds of thousands of young immigrants. Trump’s extraordinary and crass remarks sparked broad criticism. Associated Press Around the Water Cooler \nPresident Oprah? She’s ‘a strong force,’ Bill Gross says \n“I like what she said and how she said it,” the Janus Henderson fund manager said of Winfrey’s speech at this year’s Golden Globes. He responded to an on-air question about his support for a hypothetical Oprah Winfrey presidential campaign. Bloomberg \nShould South Korea ban cryptocurrencies? \nThe country reportedly wants to crack down on digital currencies by banning the trading of them on exchanges. In tandem the price of Bitcoin fell almost 14%, more sharply on Korean exchanges. Wall Street Journal \nWould you drive a car without a steering wheel or pedals? \nGeneral Motors thinks so. The automaker has petitioned the federal government for permission to deploy self-driving Chevrolet Bolts that lack a steering wheel, pedals, and other manual controls ahead of the planned launch of a robo ride-sharing service in 2019. Fortune \nDropbox is the next big tech IPO. \nThe file-sharing software company, valued at $10 billion, has confidentially filed to go public this year. It would be the biggest tech IPO since social darling Snap, which has lost much of its luster since going public. Reuters \nThis edition of CEO Daily was edited by Andrew Nusca .
