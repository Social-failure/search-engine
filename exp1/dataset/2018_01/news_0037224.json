(“Old Line Bancshares” or the “Company”) (NASDAQ:OLBK), the parent company of Old Line Bank, reports net income available to common stockholders was $5.9 million, an increase of $1.5 million, or 35.26%, for the three months ended December 31, 2017, compared to $4.3 million for the three month period ended December 31, 2016. Earnings were $0.47 per basic and $0.46 per diluted common share for the three months ended December 31, 2017, compared to $0.40 per basic share and $0.39 per diluted common share for the three months ended December 31, 2016.\nNet income available to common stockholders was $16.0 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017, compared to $13.2 million for the same period of 2016, an increase of $2.8 million, or 21.35%. Earnings were $1.38 per basic and $1.35 per diluted common share for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017 compared to $1.21 per basic and $1.20 per diluted common share for the same period of 2016. The increase in net income is primarily the result of an increase of $9.2 million, or 17.33%, in net interest income, partially offset by increases of $5.2 million in non-interest expenses and $1.3 million in income tax expense and a $455 thousand decrease in non-interest income. Included in net income for the 2017 period was $4.0 million ($2.9 million net of taxes, or $0.25 per basic and diluted common share) of merger-related expenses associated with the Company’s acquisition of DCB Bancshares, Inc. (“DCBB”), the parent company of Damascus Bank (“DCB”), in July 2017, compared to merger-related expenses of $661 thousand ($530 thousand net of taxes, or $0.04 per basic and $0.05 per diluted common share) in 2016 associated with the acquisition of Regal Bancorp, Inc., the parent company of Regal Bank & Trust in December 2015. Excluding merger-related expenses, adjusted earnings for the twelve month period ended December 31, 2017, which is a non-GAAP financial measure, were $1.63 per basic and $1.60 per diluted share compared to $1.26 per basic and $1.24 per diluted share for the twelve months ended December 31, 2016.\nTwo income tax matters had a significant influence on the fourth quarter and year ending December 31, 2017. First, on December 22, 2017 the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act was signed into law by the President of the United States of America. Upon enactment of this legislation which lowers the corporate income tax marginal rates beginning in 2018, companies were required by accounting standards to revalue their deferred tax assets and liabilities as of December 31, 2017 at the lower enacted rate. Through an analysis of the deferred tax accounts, the estimated impact of the change in rate resulted in an adjustment of $1.89 million to the net deferred income taxes and a resulting increase in income tax expense. Secondly, in the prior year, the Company had maintained a deferred tax asset valuation allowance in relation to net operating loss carryovers and other items in relation to the acquisition of Regal Bank which occurred in December of 2015. The concerns that existed at the time of establishing the valuation reserve relating to this acquisition no longer exist and the Company has reversed this valuation allowance in total. The effect of reversing this valuation reserve increased net deferred income taxes in the amount of $2.36 million with a resulting decrease in income tax expense. The net impact of these two matters resulted in a reduction of income tax expense by $472 thousand and an increase in both basic and diluted earnings per share by $.04 for the fourth quarter and year ending 2017. The Company estimated a tax rate of 24.50% if the full legislation noted above would have been effective in 2017. For more accurate comparisons to prior periods, references are made to pre-tax income or net income before income taxes as shown on the income statement completed in accordance to GAAP.\nFor the three months ended December 31, 2017 pre-tax income increased $1.5 million, or 21.90%, to $8.2 million or $0.66 per basic and $0.64 per diluted share, compared to $6.7 million or $0.62 per basic and $0.61 per diluted share for the three months ended December 31, 2016. Pre-tax income for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017 increased $4.1 million, or 20.78%, to $24.1 million or $2.08 per basic and $2.04 per diluted share compared to $20.0 million or $1.84 per basic and $1.82 per diluted share for the same period of 2016.\nNet interest income increased during each of the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2017 compared to the same periods of 2016, primarily as a result of increases in interest income and fees on loans due to an increase in net loans held for investment, partially offset by increases in interest expense. Non-interest expense increased for the three months periods primarily due to increases in salaries and benefits and to a lesser extent, occupancy and equipment expenses. Non-interest expenses increased for the twelve month period primarily due to the merger-related expenses discussed above. Non-interest income decreased in 2017 compared to 2016 primarily as a result of a decrease in gain on sales and calls of investment securities.\nAs of December 31, 2017, including as a result of the DCBB merger, the Company had total assets of approximately $2.1 billion, net loans of approximately $1.7 billion and deposits of approximately $1.7 billion.\nTotal assets increased $44.4 million compared to September 30, 2017 and $396.6 million compared to December 31, 2016. Included in total assets at December 31, 2017 is approximately $209.3 million of assets acquired in the DCBB acquisition.\nNet loans held for investment increased $29.9 million, or 1.79%, during the three months ended December 31, 2017 as compared to September 30, 2017, and $335.2 million, or 24.62%, during the twelve months ended December 31, 2016. Net loans exclusive of the loans acquired in the DCBB acquisition increased $118.1 million, or 8.68%, during the twelve months ended December 31, 2017. Net loans acquired from DCBB were $197.2 million at December 31, 2017, which represents a $20.0 million reduction since the date of acquisition due to payoffs.\nJames W. Cornelsen, President and Chief Executive Officer of Old Line Bancshares, stated: “We are extremely proud of our asset quality and pleased to report a new historical 10-year low of 0.18% of non-performing assets to total assets at December 31, 2017. Although merger and acquisition expenses negatively impacted 2017 earnings, we are still pleased with the results. Excluding these expenses, pre-tax income for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017 increased 36.23% over the same twelve month period of 2016. These results demonstrate our commitment to enhancing profitability with a focus on continuing our efforts of organic growth. We are also looking forward to 2018 and the opportunity to expand our existing footprint in the Baltimore Metropolitan Area with the previously announced merger with Bay Bancorp, Inc. which is expected to close during the second quarter of this year. This combination will bring our total branches to 37, ranking as the second-most locations of all independent Maryland-based commercial banks. Looking forward to the year ahead, we believe that the Company is well positioned to continue its profitable growth to maximize stockholder value,” stated Mr. Cornelsen.\n4 th QUARTER HIGHLIGHTS\nNet loans held for investment increased $29.9 million during the three month period ended December 31, 2017 from the September 30, 2017 balance as a result of organic growth. Average gross loans increased $344.2 million, or 25.87%, during the three month period ended December 31, 2017, to $1.7 billion from $1.3 billion for the three months ended December 31, 2016. These increases are primarily the result of the acquisition of DCBB. Nonperforming assets decreased to a new 10 year historical low of 0.18% of total assets at December 31, 2017 from 0.59% at December 31, 2016. Total yield on interest earning assets increased to 4.39% for the three months ended December 31, 2017, compared to 4.36% for the same period of 2016. Return on average assets (“ROAA”) and Return on average equity (“ROAE”) were 1.12% and 11.09%, respectively, for the three months ended December 31, 2017, compared to ROAA and ROAE of 1.03% and 11.10%, respectively, for the three months ended December 31, 2016.\n2017 FULL YEAR HIGHLIGHTS :\nThe merger with DCBB became effective on July 28, 2017 resulting in total assets of $2.1 billion.\nNet income available to common stockholders increased $2.8 million or 21.35% to $16.0 million, or $1.38 per basic and $1.35 per diluted share, for the twelve month period ended December 31, 2017, from $13.2 million, or $1.21 per basic and $1.20 per diluted share, for the twelve months ended December 31, 2016. Excluding merger-related expenses, adjusted operating earnings, which is a non-GAAP financial measure, for the twelve month period ended December 31, 2017 increased $2.9 million (net of taxes) to $18.9 million, or $1.63 per basic and $1.60 per diluted share compared to $13.7 million, or $1.26 per basic and $1.24 per diluted share for the twelve months ended December 31, 2016. Net loans held for investment increased $335.2 million, or 24.62%, during the twelve months ended December 31, 2017, bringing the balance to $1.7 billion at December 31, 2017 compared to $1.4 billion at December 31, 2016. This increase is the result of the acquisition of DCBB and, to a lesser extent, organic growth. Excluding the DCBB acquisition, net loans held for investment during 2017 grew $118.1 million. Average gross loans increased $277.9 million, or 22.28%, during the twelve month period ended December 31, 2017, to $1.5 billion from $1.2 billion for the twelve months ended December 31, 2016. These increases are primarily the result of the acquisition of DCBB and, to a lesser extent, organic growth. Total assets increased $396.6 million, or 23.21%, since December 31, 2016, with the DCBB acquisition accounting for $209.3 million of such increase. ROAA and ROAE were 0.84% and 8.53%, respectively, for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017, compared to ROAA and ROAE of 0.83% and 8.83%, respectively, for the twelve months ending December 31, 2016. Excluding merger-related expenses, ROAA and ROAE (both non-GAAP financial measures) would have been 0.99% and 9.77% for the twelve months ended at December 31, 2017 compared to 0.86% and 9.18% for the twelve months ended December 31, 2016. Total yield on interest earning assets increased to 4.35% for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017, compared to 4.31% for 2016. Total deposits grew by $327.0 million, or 24.66%, since December 31, 2016. The DCBB acquisition provided approximately $278.0 million in deposits while new organic deposits were approximately $49.0 million for the twelve months ending December 31, 2017. We ended 2017 with a book value of $16.61 per common share and a tangible book value of $14.10 per common share compared to $13.81 and $12.59, respectively, at December 31, 2016. We maintained appropriate levels of liquidity and by all regulatory measures remained “well capitalized.” On September 27, 2017, Old Line Bancshares entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger with Bay Bancorp, Inc. (“BYBK”), the parent company of Bay Bank, FSB. Pursuant to the terms of the merger agreement, upon the consummation of the merger of Bay Bancorp with and into Old Line Bancshares, all outstanding shares of Bay Bancorp common stock will be exchanged for shares of common stock of Old Line Bancshares. Consummation of the merger is contingent upon the approval of Old Line Bancshares and Bay Bancorp’s stockholders as well as receipt of all necessary regulatory and third party approvals and consents. We expect the merger to close during the second quarter of 2018. At September 30, 2017, Bay Bancorp had consolidated assets of approximately $652 million. Bay Bank has 11 banking locations located in its primary market areas of Baltimore City and Anne Arundel, Baltimore, Howard and Harford Counties, Maryland.\nTotal assets at December 31, 2017 increased $396.6 million from December 31, 2016, primarily due to increases of $335.2 million in loans held for investment, $15.3 million in goodwill, $18.8 million in investment securities available for sale and $11.7 million in cash and cash equivalents, partially offset by a decrease of $4.0 million in loans held for sale. This increase includes our acquisition of DCBB’s assets, which were valued at approximately $209.3 million at December 31, 2017.\nDeposits increased $327.0 million during the twelve months ended December 31, 2017, of which $120.5 million is attributable to an increase in our non-interest bearing deposits and the remaining $206.5 million, is attributable to an increase in our interest bearing deposits. As noted above, this increase is primarily the result of our acquisition of approximately $278 million of deposits in the DCBB merger and, to a lesser extent, our continued efforts to enhance our deposit customer base in our surrounding areas.\nAverage interest earning assets increased $358.3 million for the three month period ending December 31, 2017 compared to the same period of 2016. The average yield on such assets was 4.39% for the three months ending December 31, 2017 compared to 4.36% for the comparable 2016 period. The increase in the average yield is primarily the result of higher yields on our investment securities available for sale, partially offset by a decrease in the average yield on our loans held for investment. Average interest-bearing liabilities increased $223.3 million for the three month period ending December 31, 2017 compared to the same period of 2016. The average rate paid on such liabilities increased to 0.91% for the three month period ended December 31, 2017 compared to 0.79% for the same period in 2016, primarily due to higher rates paid on our borrowings.\nAverage interest earning assets increased $295.9 million for the twelve month period ended December 31, 2017 compared to the same period of 2016. The average yield on such assets was 4.35% for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017 compared to 4.31% for the comparable 2016 period. The increase in the yield on interest earning assets is primarily the result of a higher yield on our investment portfolio, partially offset by a slight decrease in the yield on our loans held for investment portfolio. Average interest-bearing liabilities increased $203.1 million for the twelve month period ended December 31, 2017 compared to the same period of 2016. The average rate paid on such liabilities increased to 0.88% for the twelve month period ended December 31, 2017 compared to 0.68% for the same period in 2016, primarily due to higher rates paid on our borrowings.\nThe net interest margin for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2017 decreased to 3.72% and 3.69%, respectively, from 3.75% and 3.79% for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2016. The net interest margin during the 2017 periods was affected by the increase in interest expense, primarily due to the interest paid on our borrowed funds, which for the twelve month period, includes the impact of the subordinated notes we issued in 2016; interest expense with respect to the subordinated notes was significantly lower during the twelve months ending December 31, 2016, due to their issuance in August of 2016. The net interest margin during 2017 was also affected by the amount of accretion on acquired loans. Accretion decreased due to a lower amount of early payoffs on acquired loans with credit marks during the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2017 compared to the same periods of 2016. The fair value accretion/amortization is recorded on pay-downs recognized during the periods, which contributed five and seven basis points, respectively, for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2017 compared to five and nine basis points, respectively, for the same periods of 2016.\nNet interest income increased $3.2 million, or 22.94%, and $9.2 million, or 17.33%, for the three and twelve month periods ended December 31, 2017 compared to the same periods of 2016, primarily due to increases in the interest recognized on loans as a result of the DCBB acquisition and, to a lesser extent, organic loan growth, partially offset by increases in interest expense. Interest expense increased during both periods due to increases in both the amount of and interest rate paid on our deposits and, for the twelve month period interest paid on the subordinated notes discussed above for a full year compared to a four month period during 2016.\nThe provision for loan losses decreased $100 thousand for the three month period ended December 31, 2017 compared to the same period 2016 due to an improvement in our non-performing assets. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2017, the provision decreased $629 thousand, primarily due to one large commercial borrower, consisting of 23 commercial loans totaling $3.0 million, of which $1.0 million was charged-off against the allowance for loan losses and $2.0 million was reclassified as trouble debt restructurings during the first quarter of 2017. Amounts charged off in relation to these loans during 2017 were in line with specific reserves at December 31, 2016. These trouble debt restructurings are classified as impaired and all our impaired loans have been adequately reserved for at December 31, 2017.\nNon-interest income increased $228 thousand, or 14.52%, for the three month period ended December 31, 2017 compared to the same period of 2016, primarily as a result of increases of $188 thousand in other fees and commissions and $156 thousand in service charges on deposit accounts, partially offset by a decrease of $91 thousand in income on marketable loans. The increase in other fees and commissions is primarily the result of recoveries of previously charged-off acquired loans and an increase in rental income. The increase in service charges on deposits accounts is the result of increased income on bank debit cards due to the increased deposit base primarily as a result of the DCBB merger. The decrease in income on marketable loans is a result of a decrease in the volume of residential mortgage loans sold in the secondary market compared to the same period of 2016.\nNon-interest income decreased $455 thousand, or 5.52%, for the twelve month period ended December 31, 2017 compared to the same period of 2016. The decrease is primarily a result of a $1.2 million decrease in gain on sales of investment securities, partially offset by increases of $250 thousand in other fees and commissions, $101 thousand in gain on disposal of assets, $254 thousand on service charges on deposit accounts and $95 thousand in gain on sales of loans compared to the same period of 2016. The decrease in gain on sales or calls or investment securities is the result of our re-positioning our investment portfolio during 2016, pursuant to which we sold approximately $108 million of our lowest yielding, longer duration investments; during the twelve months ended December 31, 2017, we had $60.9 million in sales and calls of investment securities, $41.8 million of which was from, and sold immediately after, the DCBB merger, resulting in no gain or loss. The increase in gain on disposal of assets is due to the sale of two of our previously-owned locations, the Accokeek branch that was closed in 2016 and Callaway branch that was closed in 2017. The increase in service charges on deposit accounts is the result of increased income on bank debit cards primarily due to the increase in our customer deposit base as noted above. The increase in gain on sale of loans (other than residential mortgage loans held for sale) is due to the sale of one SBA loan during the 2017 period, whereas we did not sell any portfolio loans during the 2016 period.\nNon-interest expense increased $2.1 million, or 23.91%, for the three month period ended December 31, 2017 compared to the same period of 2016, primarily as a result of the increase in salaries and benefits expenses, occupancy and equipment expenses and other operating expenses. Salaries and benefits increased $948 thousand primarily as a result of the additional staff, and occupancy and equipment expenses increased $427 thousand primarily as a result of the new branches that we acquired in the DCBB merger.\nNon-interest expense increased $5.2 million, or 13.12%, for the twelve month period ended December 31, 2017 compared to the same period of 2016, primarily as a result of increases in merger and integration expenses and, to a lesser extent, in salaries and benefits and occupancy and equipment expenses, partially offset by a lack of severance payments in 2017 compared to $443 thousand of such payments in 2016. Merger and integration expenses increased $3.3 million to $4.0 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017 due to the DCBB acquisition, compared to $661 thousand of merger and integration expenses during 2016 in connection with the Regal Bancorp acquisition that was consummated in December 2015. Consistent with the increases in non-interest expenses during the three month period, the $963 thousand increase in salaries and benefits expenses is primarily the result of the additional staff, and the $285 thousand occupancy and equipment expense is primarily associated with the new branches that we acquired in the DCBB acquisition.\nOld Line Bancshares is the parent company of Old Line Bank, a Maryland chartered commercial bank headquartered in Bowie, Maryland, approximately 10 miles east of Andrews Air Force Base and 20 miles east of Washington, D.C.
