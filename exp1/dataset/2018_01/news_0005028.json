I love playing in front of you guys even though sometimes you may not see it that way, but I do.” \nKyrgios became the second Australian to lift the trophy in the tournament’s 10-year history after Lleyton Hewitt in 2014. \nThe triumph lifts him four spots to 17th in the world rankings ahead of this month’s Australian Open. \nKyrgios has often struggled to produce his best tennis at the grand slams, but he goes into the Australian Open having made a strong start to the season, including a semi-final victory over world number three Grigor Dimitrov in Brisbane. \nThe men’s field at the first grand slam of the year has already been hit by the withdrawals of five-times runner-up Andy Murray and Japan’s former U.S. Open finalist Kei Nishikori. \nThe participation of former champions Rafael Nadal, Novak Djokovic and Stan Wawrinka remains in doubt with the trio battling to overcome injury problems. \nThe tournament begins at Melbourne Park on Jan. 15.
