Furthermore, the Company anticipates its effective tax rate will be approximately 24.5% to 25.5% for the year ending December 31, 2018, which reflects the newly enacted federal tax rate of 21%, projected 2018 nontaxable income, the estimated benefit of deductions for equity-based compensation and the Company’s historic effective state and local income tax rates.\nAdditionally, the Company announced today that it will release its 2017 fourth quarter and year end results on Monday, January 22, 2018, after the close of the market. The Company will host a fourth quarter and year end earnings conference call at 8:00 a.m. CST on Tuesday, January 23, 2018.
