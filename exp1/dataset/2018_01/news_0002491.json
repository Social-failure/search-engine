It is also due to receive around $1.2 billion in debt repayment from its subsidiary, Steinhoff Africa Retail. \nSteinhoff said in its latest statement that Ben la Grange would leave his chief financial officer role and Philip Dieperink would become acting CFO. \nThe company said la Grange would however be concentrating on “the preservation and procurement of liquidity in the group” and finalizing its 2017 accounts. \nThe company also said it planned to hire a debt restructuring expert in the role of chief restructuring officer. \nIn a presentation prepared for a meeting with lenders in London on December 19, Steinhoff said some credit facilities were being suspended or withdrawn and insurers were cancelling or reducing credit insurance. \nSteinhoff earlier this week said it would have to restate its 2015 accounts and maybe earlier figures, having already warned on its 2016 numbers.
