(NYSE:EGF) (the “Fund”) announced that the Fund paid the following dividend per share:\nFund Pay Date Per Share EGF January 9, 2018 $0.041000 The Fund has adopted a level distribution plan, consistent with its investment objective and policies, to support a level distribution of income, capital gains, and/or return of capital (the “Plan”). The fixed amount distributed per share is subject to change at the discretion of the Fund’s Board of Directors. Under the Plan, the Fund will distribute all available investment income to its shareholders, consistent with its investment objective and as required by the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. If sufficient investment income is not available on a monthly basis, the Fund will distribute long-term capital gains and/or return capital to its shareholders in order to maintain a level distribution.\nThe Fund’s estimated sources of the distributions paid as of January 9, 2018 and for its fiscal year 2017 are as follows:\nEstimated Allocations as of January 9, 2018 Fund Distribution Net Investment\nIncome\nNet Realized\nShort-Term\nGains\nNet Realized\nLong-Term\nGains\nReturn of Capital EGF 1 $0.041000 $0.008571 (21%) $0 (0%) $0 (0%) $0.032429 (79%) Estimated Allocations for Fiscal Year 2017 Fund Distribution Net Investment\nIncome\nNet Realized\nShort-Term\nGains\nNet Realized\nLong-Term\nGains\nReturn of Capital EGF 1 $0.492000 $0.278998 (57%) $0 (0%) $0 (0%) $0.213002 (43%) 1 The Fund estimates that it has distributed more than its income and net-realized capital gains in the current fiscal year; therefore, a portion of your distribution may be a return of capital. A return of capital may occur, for example, when some or all of the shareholder’s investment is paid back to the shareholder. A return of capital distribution does not necessarily reflect the Fund's investment performance and should not be confused with ‘yield’ or ‘income’. When distributions exceed total return performance, the difference will reduce the Fund’s net asset value per share.\nThe amounts and sources of distributions reported are only estimates and are not provided for tax reporting purposes. The actual amounts and sources of the amounts for tax reporting purposes will depend upon the Fund’s investment experience during the remainder of its fiscal year and may be subject to changes based on tax regulations. The Fund will send you a Form 1099-DIV for the calendar year that will tell you how to report these distributions for federal income tax purposes.\nFund Performance and Distribution Rate Information: Fund Average annual\ntotal return (in\nrelation to net asset\nvalue (“NAV”) for\nthe 5-year period\nending on\n11/30/2017\nAnnualized current\ndistribution rate\nexpressed as a\npercentage of NAV\nas of 11/30/2017\nCumulative total\nreturn (in relation to\nNAV) for the fiscal\nyear through\n11/30/2017\nCumulative fiscal\nyear distributions as\na percentage of NAV\nas of 11/30/2017\nEGF 1.53% 3.53% 3.83% 3.24% Shareholders should not draw any conclusions about the Fund’s investment performance from the amount of the Fund’s current distributions or from the terms of the Plan.\nAbout BlackRock\nBlackRock helps investors build better financial futures.
