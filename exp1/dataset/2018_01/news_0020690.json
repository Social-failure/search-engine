Britain’s financial watchdog has also launched two probes into Provident Financial’s lending practices. \nProvident first warned about problems at its door-to-door lending operation in late June, but said in August the situation had deteriorated and the business would lose between 80 million and 120 million pounds in 2017. \nThe lender said that as part of an ongoing process of looking at its costs, the home credit business would cut jobs at its central support functions. \nInterim Executive Chairman Malcolm Le May said the lender had made progress in the search for a new chief. \nProvident Financial said Vanquis Bank and Moneybarn units had both started talking to the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) with a “view to reaching a resolution to their respective investigations”.
