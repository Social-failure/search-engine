In Cambodia, a global garment-making hub, the minimum monthly wage for garment workers is $170.\nThe Thai committee’s recommendation must be approved by Cabinet before it can take effect. The committee said the new wage, once approved by Cabinet - a formality - will start from April this year.\nThailand ranks among the world’s top automotive export countries and is a regional manufacturing hub, particularly for Japanese carmakers. The country is also among the world’s top exporters of rice, shrimp, rubber and sugar.
