Noble has stood by its accounts. \nElman is Noble’s biggest shareholder with a stake of a little more than 18 percent. Other large investors include sovereign wealth fund China Investment Corp and Orbis Investment Management. \nNoble said the restructuring proposes a debt-to-equity swap that, along with the issuance of equity to retain and incentivize the management team, is expected to result in dilution of existing shareholders’ interest in the company. \nIt said that senior debt holders would end up owning 70 percent of the company after the restructuring, with 20 percent owned by management and the rest by existing shareholders. \nNoble also plans to exchange $400 million of perpetual securities for an aggregate payment of up to $15 million, subject to approval from holders of its perpetual bonds. \nThe restructuring includes a three-year committed trade finance and hedging facility of up to $700 million for the company’s commodities trading businesses. \n($1 = 1.3107 Singapore dollars)", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-29T18:48:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-29T19:25:59.019+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
