(NYSE American: CDOR), a hotel-focused real estate investment trust (REIT) headquartered and incorporated in the state of Maryland, today announced the closing on the sale of a legacy hotel asset, the 41-room Supertel Inn located at 800 Laurel Street in Creston, Iowa for $2.1 million. Net proceeds from the sale will be applied to outstanding debt on the Company’s $150 million secured credit facility.\n“With the closing of the Supertel Inn we have only four remaining legacy hotels of the 55 that the Company owned at the beginning of 2015,” said Bill Blackham, Condor’s Chief Executive Officer. “Our goal is to have two of the four legacy hotels sold in the first half of 2018, thereby effectively concluding the recycling of proceeds from the sale of legacy hotels into our new investment platform, though there can be no guarantee that any of these planned dispositions will actually close,” Mr. Blackham continued.\nAbout Condor Hospitality Trust, Inc.\nCondor Hospitality Trust, Inc.
