Analysts on average had expected $1.23 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. \nJuniper posted a net loss of $148.1 million or 40 cents per share, reflecting a $289.5 million one-time charge related to new U.S. tax laws. \nExcluding one-time items, Juniper earned 53 cents per share, edging past analysts’ average estimate by 1 cent. \nThe company announced an 80 percent increase to its quarterly dividend and a $2 billion share repurchase plan. \nIt plans to repatriate about $3 billion as a result of the recent U.S. tax reform.
