The Information Ministry did not immediately respond to an email seeking clarification. \nVenezuela’s opposition-run Congress has declared the petro an illegal debt issuance by a government desperate for cash, and has said it will not recognize it. \nThe U.S. Treasury Department on Tuesday warned the petro could violate sanctions against Venezuela, saying that investors who acquire it could face legal risks.
