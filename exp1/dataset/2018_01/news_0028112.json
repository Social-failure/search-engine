It is a Europe that must have a common foreign policy on strategic questions, a Europe that must create its own development policies, a Europe of defence, and it is a Europe that has to be economically strong.” \nShe said the two countries could make relatively quick progress on areas such as a common corporate tax structure and a banking union for the euro zone.
