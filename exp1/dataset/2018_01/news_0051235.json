The unscheduled drill used a recording mimicking a call from U.S. Pacific Command.\nHawaii’s governor has said the employee pressed the wrong button by mistake. Hawaii officials did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\nWiley said the FCC had been unable to interview the employee who issued the alert and was unable to “fully evaluate” the assertion the employee believed it was an actual attack.\nThe FCC said “a combination of human error and inadequate safeguards contributed to the transmission of this false alert.” It said Hawaii’s “lack of preparation for how to respond to this transmission of a false alert” was largely responsible for the 38-minute delay in correcting it and questioned the large number of drills conducted in recent months as well as why the system software did not differentiate between drills and actual alerts.\n“There were no procedures in place to prevent a single person from mistakenly sending a missile alert,” Wiley said.\n“We want to minimize both the chances of future false alerts being issued as well as the impact of any such false alerts,” FCC Chairman Ajit Pai said.\nHawaii plans to issue a separate report on Tuesday.\nSeparately, the FCC voted on Tuesday to improve the geographic targeting of wireless emergency to within no more than a one-tenth of a mile overshoot by 2019.\nReporting by David Shepardson; Editing by Chizu Nomiyama, Andrew Hay and Susan Thomas\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-30T17:50:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-30T18:08:41.054+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
