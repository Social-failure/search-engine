He gave no more details, according to comments carried on local radio.\nReporting by Andrew Cawthorne in Caracas, Rodrigo de Miguel and Emma Pinedo in Madrid; Editing by Susan Thomas and Paul Simao\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-01-25T23:14:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-26T21:41:13.001+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
