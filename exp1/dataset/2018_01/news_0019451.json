Shots rang, you could hear Frank Sinatra and Christmas tunes playing in the corridors,” he told Le Figaro newspaper.\nPolice say they have recovered the millions of dollars worth of jewels that were snatched from glass display cases and caught three robbers who got blocked inside the premises.\nBut two others are on the run after fleeing the scene on the Place Vendome square in central Paris.\n“It was pretty surreal, like being in a David Lynch movie,” Beigbeder added, referring to the maker of art-house classics such as Eraserhead and Mulholland Drive.\nReporting By Brian Love; editing by Richard Lough and John Stonestreet\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-12T19:45:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-12T19:53:19.005+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
