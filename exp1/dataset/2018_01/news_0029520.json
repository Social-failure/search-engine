The selling was limited and wasn’t serious at all. A few players think the Bank of Japan will change its policy target any time soon,” said a trader at a Japanese brokerage.\nEarlier this month, the BOJ reduced its buying in long-dated bonds in its regular operation earlier this month, sparking speculation the central bank may be inching towards exit from its massive stimulus.\nBut a majority of market players expect the BOJ to maintain its policy target of “around zero percent” in the 10-year yield in the coming months, and not certainly before Governor Haruhiko Kuroda’s current term expires in April.\nAn auction of 800 billion yen ($7.2 billion) 30-year JGB auction drew tepid demand as the tenor was currently not cheap on the yield curve. The yield spread between 10- and 30-year yields stood at 74.5 basis points, the tightest since June.\nThe 30-year yield rose 0.5 basis point to 0.835 percent . The 20-year yield was steady at 0.595 percent .\n$1 = 111.12 yen Reporting by Tokyo Markets Team; Editing by Subhranshu Sahu\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-01-18T14:35:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-19T12:33:18.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
