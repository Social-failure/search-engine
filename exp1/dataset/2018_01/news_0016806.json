This has contributed to a fall in Singapore refinery profit margins to below $6 per barrel this month, their lowest seasonal level in five years.\nGAS AND COAL: STANDOUTS Gas imports hit a new annual record, smashing the previous high by 20 percent, on the back of a massive gasification drive that gained momentum late in the year as temperatures in northern China dropped.\nWith the plan to heat millions of homes with the fuel proving over-ambitious, and leading to shortages, there was also a 3.2 percent month-on-month boost in coal imports in December after the government eased restrictions on imports to keep the country warm.\nReporting by Tom Daly; Editing by Josephine Mason and Christian Schmollinger\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-01-12T18:09:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-13T14:45:16.009+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
