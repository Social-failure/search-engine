REUTERS/Eric Gaillard/Files \nThe 2015 Paris agreement, which seeks to shift the world economy from fossil fuels this century, aims to limit temperatures to “well below” a rise of 2C above pre-industrial times while pursuing efforts to limit it to 1.5C. \nOmar Baddour, WMO scientific coordinator, said temperatures could reach 2C above pre-industrial times by 2060-70. “It’s alarming, actually,” he told a news briefing in Geneva of the ever more frequent records. \nIn the United States alone, weather and climate-related disasters cost a record $306 billion in 2017, especially western wildfires and hurricanes Harvey, Maria and Irma, NOAA said last week. \nTrump wants to promote U.S. fossil fuel industries, at odds with the Paris accord’s goals of phasing out emissions from coal, oil, and natural gas between 2050 and 2100. \nBy contrast, the U.N. Secretary-General’s Special Representative for Disaster Risk Reduction, Robert Glasser, described the pace of climate change as “an existential threat to the planet” that required a “drastic response”. \nAnd Bob Ward, of the London School of Economics, said the heat “should focus the minds of world leaders, including President Trump, on the scale and urgency of the risks that people, rich and poor, face around the world from climate change.” Reporting By Alister Doyle, with extra reporting by Stephanie Nebehay, Marina Depteris and Tom Miles in Geneva; Editing by Catherine Evans", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-18T17:45:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-18T18:37:17.012+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
