That requires information,” the official said. \n“But there’s a lot of information out there so we intend to start assembling that and see what we can do.” \nCALLING FOR REPUBLIC‘S DOWNFALL \nAnti-government rallies, held in defiance of the pervasive security services, have called for the downfall of the Islamic Republic, posing one of the most sustained challenges to the established order of the major oil-exporting state since the 1979 Islamic Revolution that overthrew the U.S.-backed Shah. \nThe protests have heaped pressure on President Hassan Rouhani, a relative moderate who championed a deal struck with world powers in 2015 to curb Iran’s disputed nuclear programme in return for the lifting of most international sanctions. \nThe U.S. official left open the possibility that protests may initially been tied to Rouhani’s more conservative opponents, but said it quickly morphed into a spontaneous, broader uprising that caught Tehran off-guard. \nMany of the protesters are fuming over what they see as the failure so far of Rouhani’s government to deliver on promises of more jobs and investment as a dividend of the nuclear accord. \nThe U.S. official said the United States believed that Iranians were upset that a disproportional amount of the sanctions relief was directed towards state security services. \nStill, it was unclear how the protests might affect Trump’s thinking about the 2015 nuclear pact that eased economic pressure on Tehran in exchange for limits on its nuclear programme. \nTrump must decide by mid-January whether to continue waiving U.S. sanctions on Iran’s oil exports under the terms of the international deal. \nIf he reimposes sanctions on oil, it could increase the economic pain for Iran’s leaders. But analysts said it could also send the wrong message about U.S. support for Iran’s people in the middle of the boldest challenge to the leadership in a decade. \nAsked about those sanctions, the U.S. official said no decision had been reached. \n“We have some time,” the official said. “We’re preparing options for the president. It’s just too soon to say.” Reporting by Phil Stewart; Editing by James Dalgleish", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-04T16:22:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-04T17:27:58.003+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
