At the end of 2017, the feature began enrolling users who wanted to look at their bills into the credit scoring system, Sesame Credit.\nThat allowed Sesame Credit to collect their data and share the analysis with its partners. Users could only opt out if they unchecked a button on the feature’s landing page.\nSesame Credit apologised last week and cancelled the default option.\nCAC said the company should “step up efforts to conduct a comprehensive investigation of the Alipay platform, carry out special rectifications and take effective measures to prevent similar incidents from recurring.”\nIt Quote: d Alipay and Sesame Credit as saying that they had learned a “profound lesson” from the incident.\nAnt Financial did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment.\nReporting by Brenda Goh; Editing by Edwina Gibbs\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-01-11T09:49:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-11T03:54:55.009+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
