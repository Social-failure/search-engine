In the fourth quarter of 2017, the Company was required to revalue its deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities as a result of the “Tax Cuts and Jobs Act” signed into law on December 22, 2017. The impact was a one-time, non-cash charge to income tax provision on the income statement of approximately $2.5 million.\nFor the full year of 2017, net income was $20.4 million and earnings per diluted common share was $0.54 compared to net income of $17.5 million or $0.46 per diluted common share for the full year of 2016.

The Merger is expected to close in the first quarter of 2018 and is pending federal regulatory approval. At a Special Meeting of Shareholders of the Company held November 15, 2017, the proposal to adopt the Agreement and to approve the Merger was approved by shareholders of the Company.\nFINANCIAL CONDITION\nTotal assets were $2.16 billion at December 31, 2017, a 5% increase compared to $2.05 billion at December 31, 2016. The increase in total assets was primarily due to increases in investment securities and loans.

Calculation of net income in accordance with GAAP includes what the Company considers “non-core” items, which are items that we do not consider indicative of our core operating performance and which are not necessarily comparable from year to year. The Company reports core earnings, which is a non-GAAP financial measure that the Company defines as GAAP net income less non-core items. The reconciliation of GAAP net income to core earnings together with related financial measures and ratios is included in the schedules accompanying this release.\nFourth quarter 2017 core earnings totaled $6.6 million or $0.17 per diluted common share, compared to core earnings of $4.9 million or $0.13 per diluted common share in the fourth quarter of 2016. For the fourth quarter of 2017 and 2016, respectively, the core return on average assets measured 1.18% and 0.95%, core return on average equity measured 10.40% and 8.23% and core return on average tangible equity measured 12.95% and 10.50%. Non-core items during the fourth quarter of 2017 included transaction-related expenses incurred in connection with the pending transaction with Arvest totaling $677,000 and a deferred tax asset adjustment of $2.5 million. The effect of non-core items, net of taxes, decreased GAAP net income by approximately $2.9 million for the fourth quarter of 2017.\nNet interest income for the fourth quarter of 2017 was $18.9 million compared to $17.1 million for the same period in 2016. Net interest income for the year ended December 31, 2017 was $75.5 million, compared to $67.5 million for the same period in 2016. Interest income for the fourth quarter of 2017 was $22.0 million compared to $19.2 million for the same period in 2016.
