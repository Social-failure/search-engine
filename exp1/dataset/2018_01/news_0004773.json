This is a very hard decision for Andy and we totally respect it.”\nTiley was confident that Djokovic (elbow) and Nadal (knee) would be ready for the Jan. 15 start in Melbourne.\n“I spoke to Novak. He’s already got every hour of the day planned between when he arrives and the start of the Australian Open. He’ll be ready,” Tiley said.\n“(Rafa‘s) on his way down here now so he’ll be ready. It’s not dissimilar from last year...Last year we were talking about the health of Rafa Nadal, Roger Federer and Serena Williams and two weeks later they were playing each other in the final.”\nReporting by Martyn Herman and Hardik Vyas; editing by Amlan Chakraborty and Pritha Sarkar\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-04T09:13:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-04T09:29:23.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
