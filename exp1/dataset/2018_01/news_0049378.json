We also have to ensure the Chinese don’t take over the market and put every non-5G network out of business.” \nMajor wireless carriers have spent billions of dollars buying spectrum to launch 5G networks, and it is unclear if the U.S. government would have enough spectrum to build its own 5G network. \nLast year, T-Mobile US Inc ( TMUS.O ) spent $8 billion and Dish Network Corp ( DISH.O ) $6.2 billion to win the bulk of broadcast airwaves spectrum for sale in a government auction, held by the U.S. Federal Communications Commission. \nU.S. carriers are well into the standard-setting process for 5G, and testing is already under way. \nA Verizon ( VZ.N ) spokesman declined to comment. Representatives for AT&T, Sprint and T-Mobile ( TMUS.O ) did not immediately respond to requests for comment. \nAnother option includes having a 5G network built by a consortium or wireless carriers, the official said. \n“We want to build a secure 5G network and we have to work with industry to figure out the best way to do it,” the official said, speaking on condition of anonymity. \nAxios published documents that it said were from a presentation from a National Security Council official about the 5G issue. If the government built the 5G network, it would rent access to carriers like AT&T, Verizon and T-Mobile, Axios said. \nA looming concern laid out in the presentation is China’s growing presence in the manufacture and operation of wireless networks. A concerted government push could help the U.S. compete on that front, according to the presentation. \nA 5G network is expected to offer significantly faster speeds, more capacity and shorter response times, which could be utilized for new technologies ranging from self-driving cars to remote surgeries. Telecom companies and their suppliers consider it to be a multibillion-dollar revenue opportunity.
