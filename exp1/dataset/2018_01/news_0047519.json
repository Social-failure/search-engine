The United Nations described Myanmar’s crackdown as ethnic cleansing, which Myanmar denies. \n“I pity her because she seems to be caught in the middle of being a Nobel Prize winner for peace and this is now the ruckus, she is heavily criticised,” Duterte said in his speech. \nHuman rights groups have also strongly criticised Duterte’s anti-narcotics campaign during which more than 3,900 suspected drug users and peddlers have been killed in what the police called self-defence after armed suspects resisted arrest. \nCritics dispute that and say executions are taking place with zero accountability, allegations the police reject.
