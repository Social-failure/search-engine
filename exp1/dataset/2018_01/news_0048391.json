The diplomat was speaking on condition of anonymity. \nAn Egyptian government source confirmed that Egypt’s President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi would participate, saying he extended his stay to do so. Egypt's President Abdel-Fattah el-Sisi talks to Chad's President Idriss Deby as Palestine's President Mahmoud Abbas looks on at the 30th Ordinary Session of the Assembly of the Heads of State and the Government of the African Union in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia January 28, 2018. REUTERS/Tiksa Negeri \nSisi will meet Sudanese President Omar Hassan al-Bashir and Ethiopian Prime Minister Hailemariam Desalegn, according to the diplomat. \nDiscussions have been deadlocked for months over the wording of a study on the dam’s environmental impact. In December, Egypt proposed that the World Bank be allowed to help settle the dispute, a call dismissed by Ethiopia. \nCountries that share the Nile river have argued over the use of its waters for decades - and analysts have repeatedly warned that the disputes could eventually boil over into conflict. \nA bone of contention for both Ethiopia and Egypt is the speed at which the dam’s reservoir would be filled. \nThe Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam - now over 60 percent complete and which will churn out 6,000 MW upon completion - is centerpiece to the country’s ambitious power exporting plans.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-28T16:47:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-28T17:03:40.009+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
