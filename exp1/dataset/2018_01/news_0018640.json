But it’s a totally different story to build a business model around it that makes money,” said retail investor Wu Beicheng, adding he identified only one China-listed company, Hundsun Technologies ( 600570.SS ), as a reasonable bet. \nHighlighting how some companies are tapping into the speculative interest, the Shanghai Stock Exchange questioned Shanghai U9 Game Co ( 600652.SS ) on Thursday, asking whether it used the blockchain concept to help push up its flagging share price. The company has a large proportion of shares pledged for loans. \nRobin Zhang, compliance manager at asset manager Soochow Securities CSSD (Singapore), put China’s blockchain mania in the backdrop of a global setting, where companies including Eastman Kodak ( KODK.N ) have attracted investor fever due to their applications of the technology. \n“It’s a bit like the dot.com bubble. But after the bubble burst, some companies with real customers, revenues and performance, will stand out, like Google or Alibaba.” Reporting by Samuel Shen and John Ruwitch; Editing by Jacqueline Wong", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-12T10:06:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-12T11:08:32.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
