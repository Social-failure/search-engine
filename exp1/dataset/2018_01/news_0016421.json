It said on Wednesday that it expects additional savings of $200 million, unrelated to store closures. \n“While the company has managed to stay afloat by selling and spinning off its real estate assets to generate cash, the chance of a turnaround seems bleak,” Morningstar analyst Steve Jellinek said. \nLast week, Sears said it would close another 103 unprofitable Kmart and Sears stores, on top of the 63 it plans to close this month. \nFor the fourth quarter, the company said it expects a net loss of $200 million to $320 million, excluding charges from closing stores, severance and tax-related matters. \nThat compares with a net loss of $607 million the same period a year earlier. \nThe $100 million funding deal is backed by land leases and select intellectual property. The company added that it would be entitled to raise a further $200 million under certain conditions. \nSears also said it won concessions from lenders that allow it to borrow more money based off of the value of its inventory. \nShares of the company, whose going-concern warning epitomized the troubles of America’s biggest traditional retailers, tumbled more than 60 percent in 2017.
