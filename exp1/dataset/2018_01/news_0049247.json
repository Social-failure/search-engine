Sanches, 20, suffered the same injury in the goalless third-round draw with Wolverhampton Wanderers. \n“He will be assessed after 48 hours,” Carvalhal told the club’s website (www.swanseacity.com). “Then we will know exactly what the problem is with him.” \nSanches, who joined the Welsh club on loan from German side Bayern Munich in the close season, has struggled for form and fitness this season, making 12 league appearances and four more starts in domestic cup competitions. \nSwansea are bottom of the league table with 20 points after five wins, five draws and 14 defeats while Arsenal are sixth.
