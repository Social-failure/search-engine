The Company provides supplemental information regarding its operating performance on a non-GAAP basis that excludes certain gains, losses and charges, or events which occur relatively infrequently and which management considers to be outside our core operating results. Non-GAAP results are not in accordance with GAAP and may not be comparable to non-GAAP information provided by other companies. Non-GAAP information should be considered a supplement to, and not a substitute for, financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP. A complete reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP results is attached to this press release.\nRevenue for the fiscal third quarter of 2018 was $217.1 million. This compared with $204.4 million reported last quarter, and $176.4 million reported in the same period one year ago. GAAP net loss for the fiscal third quarter of 2018 was $68.2 million, or a loss of $0.51 per diluted share (including a one-time GAAP provision of $101.9 million for the estimated impacts of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (\"TCJA\"), which was enacted on December 22, 2017, discussed further below) versus GAAP net income of $18.7 million or $0.14 per diluted share last quarter, and GAAP net income from continuing operations of $33.4 million or $0.24 per diluted share in the same period one year ago. Fiscal third quarter GAAP results include $10.8 million in acquisition-related and restructuring charges, $13.6 million in stock-based compensation, $3.7 million in non-cash interest expense, $0.4 million in certain unrealized foreign exchange gain and a one-time GAAP provision of $101.9 million for the estimated impacts of the TCJA. The estimated $101.9 million impact of the TCJA includes $10.2 million from the remeasurement of U.S. deferred tax assets and liabilities at lower enacted corporate tax rates and $91.7 million from the tax on deemed repatriation of historical foreign earnings. The net taxes payable (net of tax attributes of approximately $59.1 million) on deemed repatriation of historical foreign earnings is approximately $32.6 million, which will be payable over 8 years starting in the next fiscal year. Non-GAAP net income for the fiscal third quarter of 2018 was $57.6 million or $0.42 per diluted share, compared with non-GAAP net income of $48.1 million or $0.35 per diluted share last quarter, and non-GAAP net income from continuing operations of $49.0 million or $0.35 per diluted share reported in the same period one year ago. GAAP gross profit for the fiscal third quarter of 2018 was $128.4 million, or 59.1 percent, compared with GAAP gross profit of $116.8 million or 57.1 percent last quarter, and $104.1 million, or 59.0 percent, reported in the same period one year ago. Non-GAAP gross profit for the fiscal third quarter of 2018 was $136.6 million, or 62.9 percent, compared with non-GAAP gross profit of $125.5 million, or 61.4 percent last quarter, and $108.7 million, or 61.6 percent, reported in the same period one year ago. GAAP R&D expense for the fiscal third quarter of 2018 was $49.8 million, compared with GAAP R&D expense of $48.7 million last quarter, and $38.2 million reported in the same period one year ago. Non-GAAP R&D expense for the fiscal third quarter of 2018 was $42.8 million, compared with non-GAAP R&D expense of $41.3 million last quarter, and $33.5 million in the same period one year ago. GAAP SG&A expense for the fiscal third quarter of 2018 was $40.7 million, compared with GAAP SG&A expense of $44.5 million last quarter, and $32.7 million in the same period one year ago. Non-GAAP SG&A expense for the fiscal third quarter of 2018 was $31.1 million, compared with non-GAAP SG&A expense of $31.2 million last quarter, and $25.7 million in the same period one year ago.\nWebcast and Conference Call Information\nInvestors may listen to the live call at 1:30 p.m. Pacific Time on January 29, 2018 by calling 844-308-4493.

Risks include, but are not limited to, global business and economic conditions, fluctuations in product demand, manufacturing capacity and costs, inventory management, competition, pricing, patent and other intellectual property rights of third parties, timely development and introduction of new products and manufacturing processes, dependence on one or more customers for a significant portion of sales, successful integration of acquired businesses and technology, availability of capital, cash flow and other risk factors detailed in the Company's Securities and Exchange Commission filings. The Company urges investors to review in detail the risks and uncertainties in the Company's Securities and Exchange Commission filings, including but not limited to the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended April 2, 2017. All forward-looking statements are made as of the date of this release and the Company disclaims any duty to update such statements.\nNon-GAAP Reporting\nTo supplement its consolidated financial results presented in accordance with GAAP, IDT uses non-GAAP financial measures which are adjusted from the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures to exclude certain items, as described in detail below. Management believes that these non-GAAP financial measures reflect an additional and useful way of viewing aspects of the Company's operations that, when viewed in conjunction with IDT's GAAP results, provide a more comprehensive understanding of the various factors and trends affecting the Company's business and operations. It should also be noted that IDT's non-GAAP information may be different from the non-GAAP information provided by other companies. Non-GAAP financial measures used by IDT include:\nCost of revenues; Gross profit; Research and development expenses; Selling, general and administrative expenses; Interest and other income (expense); Benefit from (provision for) income taxes; Operating income; Net income; Diluted net income per share; and Weighted average shares outstanding - diluted\nThe Company presents non-GAAP financial measures because the investor community uses non-GAAP results in its analysis and comparison of historical results and projections of the Company's future operating results. These non-GAAP results exclude acquisition-related expense, restructuring and divestiture related costs (gain), share-based compensation expense, results from discontinued operations, and certain other expenses and benefits. Management uses these non-GAAP measures to manage and assess the profitability of the business. These non-GAAP results are also consistent with the way management internally analyzes IDT's financial results.\nThere are limitations in using non-GAAP financial measures because they are not prepared in accordance with GAAP and may be different from non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies. The presentation of non-GAAP financial information is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures. The non-GAAP financial measures supplement, and should be viewed in conjunction with, GAAP financial measures. Investors should review the reconciliations of the non-GAAP financial measures to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measures as provided in the accompanying press release.\nAs presented in the \"Reconciliation of GAAP to Non-GAAP\" tables in the accompanying press release, each of the non-GAAP financial measures excludes one or more of the following items:\nAcquisition-related. Acquisition-related charges are not factored into management's evaluation of potential acquisitions or IDT's performance after completion of acquisitions, because they are not related to the Company's core operating performance. Adjustments of these items provide investors with a basis to compare IDT's performance to other companies without the variability caused by purchase accounting. Acquisition-related expenses primarily include:\nAmortization of acquisition-related intangibles, which include acquired intangibles such as purchased technology, patents, customer relationships, trademarks, backlog and non-compete agreements. Acquisition-related costs such as legal, accounting and other professional or consulting fees directly related to an acquisition. Fair market value adjustment to acquired inventory sold.\nRestructuring-related. Restructuring charges primarily relate to changes in IDT's infrastructure in efforts to reduce costs and expenses (gains) associated with strategic divestitures and restructuring in force actions. Restructuring charges (gains) are excluded from non-GAAP financial measures because they are not considered core operating activities. Although IDT has engaged in various restructuring activities in the past, each has been a discrete event based on a unique set of business objectives. As such, management believes that it is appropriate to exclude restructuring charges (gains) from IDT's non-GAAP financial measures as it enhances the ability of investors to compare the Company's period-over-period operating results. Restructuring-related charges (gains) primarily include:\nSeverance costs directly related to a restructuring action. Facility closure costs consist of ongoing costs associated with the exit of our leased and owned facilities. Gain on divestiture consists of gains recognized upon the strategic sale of business units. Assets impairments including accelerated depreciation of certain assets no longer in use.\nOther adjustments. These items are excluded from non-GAAP financial measures because they are not related to the core operating activities and on-going future operating performance of IDT. Excluding this data allows investors to better compare IDT's period-over-period performance without such expense, which IDT believes may be useful to the investor community.\nOther adjustments primarily include:\nStock based compensation expense. Compensation expense (benefit) – deferred compensation, consists of gains and losses on marketable equity securities related to our deferred compensation arrangements. Non-cash interest expense, consists of amortization of issuance cost and accretion of discount related to the convertible notes. Loss (gain) on deferred compensation plan securities represents the changes in the fair value of the assets in a separate trust that is invested in corporate owned life insurance under our deferred compensation plan. Unrealized foreign currency gains and losses resulting from remeasurement of certain non-functional currency account balances. Tax effects of non-GAAP adjustments. Non-GAAP tax calculation is based on estimated cash tax expense and reserves. The Company forecasts its annual cash tax liability and allocates the tax to each quarter in proportion to earnings for that period. This approach is designed to enhance the ability of investors to understand the impact of the Company's tax expense on its current operations, provide improved modeling accuracy, and substantially reduce fluctuations caused by GAAP to non-GAAP adjustments, which may not reflect actual cash tax expense. The one-time tax impacts of the TCJA related to non-current liabilities and deferred tax assets are not reflected in the non-GAAP tax provision. Diluted weighted average shares non-GAAP adjustment, for purposes of calculating non-GAAP diluted net income per share, the GAAP diluted weighted average shares outstanding is adjusted to exclude the benefits of stock compensation expense attributable to future services not yet recognized in the financial statements that are treated as proceeds assumed to be used to repurchase shares under the GAAP treasury method.\nIDT and the IDT logo are trademarks or registered trademarks of Integrated Device Technology, Inc.
