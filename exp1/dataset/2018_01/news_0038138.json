The Aggies outshot Missouri 39.1 percent-27.8 percent and owned a 46-38 edge on the glass.\nJordan Geist, Jeremiah Tilmon and Jordan Barnett each scored nine points to lead the Tigers (13-6, 3-3).\nThe Aggies led 29-20 after a first half in which both teams struggled to make shots. A&M hit just 11 of 36 field-goal attempts (30.6 percent) but the Tigers were even worse, making only 7 of 27 from the floor and just 2 of 9 from 3-point territory.\nWith all the missed shots, there were plenty of rebounds to go around and the Aggies took 26 of them in the first half to 20 for Missouri.\nA&M got all its scoring from just four players - led by Williams with nine points and Trocha-Morelos with eight - while Geist’s six points paced Missouri.\nThe Tigers rallied to take a 32-31 lead on a layup by Kevin Puryear with 15:48 to play but Texas A&M regained its stride and forged a 13-6 run that put it back in command.\nNext up for the Aggies is Tuesday’s game at LSU while Missouri hosts Auburn on Wednesday.\n-- Field Level Media\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-01-21T07:34:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-21T13:20:13.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
