Miller told CNBC in December that half the value of his fund was in bitcoin. \nHe said they began buying bitcoin in 2014 or 2015, at an average cost of about $350. Bitcoin is currently trading near $14 935, according to CryptocurrencyMarket.com. Moving it to a separate fund allows investors to decide whether they want to continue to hold or sell it, he told CNBC. \nDigital currencies have grabbed a lot of attention from investors because of their quick and steep gains in the last few months. A coin created by the startup Ripple dropped 10 percent earlier Tuesday after soaring 35,000 percent last year. Miller told CNBC on Tuesday that the rally in ripple, which is currently trading around $2.18, was \"way overdone.\" \nBut the interest in new digital coins hasn't gone away. Also on Tuesday, Kodak , a 130-year-old company, announced it will roll out its own digital currency as part of a new photography royalty tracking product. \n\"There's probably something out there that makes sense but it takes a lot of digging to find it,\" Miller said about the wave of newer, much cheaper, alternatives to bitcoin. \"It's not exactly, I'd say, careful evaluation going on.\" \nMiller founded his fund in 2016 after 35 years as a manager at Legg Mason, where he rose to celebrity by beating the S&P 500 15 years in a row through 2005. He earned a reputation for taking concentrated bets. His fund currently holds bank stocks such as Citigroup, Bank of America and J.P.
