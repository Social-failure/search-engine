It wasn’t what I’d like to see going forward,” Pardew told BT Sport.

We waited so long to wait for the decisions, the stadium went flat and every goal was a bit of a mockery because we were waiting for the decision.” \nOn the goal ruled out for offside, he added: “I found it hard to believe from a corner. Is it (VAR) going to start taking away goals?” \nLiverpool manager Juergen Klopp was less bothered about VAR and more concerned with how familiar defensive deficiencies had cost his team their best chance of domestic silverware this season. \n“Big mistakes let them back in the game,” he said, noting how Firmino’s fifth-minute goal was quickly wiped out by Rodriguez’s double. \n“It’s obvious what we did wrong in these situations. The second goal was just, wow, really bad defending from the whole group.” Reporting by Ian Chadband, editing by Ed Osmond", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-28T01:07:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-28T01:30:12.002+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
