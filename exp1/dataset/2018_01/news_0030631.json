Banks on the list include Sberbank, VTB and Russian Agriculture Bank, along with Gazprombank and privately-owned Rossiya.\nReporting by Darya Korsunskaya; Writing by Jack Stubbs; Editing by Christian Lowe\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-01-18T21:48:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-18T15:56:59.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
