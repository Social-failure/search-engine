The double also took his FA Cup total in this campaign to a competition-leading six from five games.\n“From start to finish we were brilliant, our quality really came out. It was an enjoyable game to play in. There was only going to be one winner after the first goal went in,” Grigg, who headed the opener after just seven minutes, told the BBC.\n“A Cup run is great. The extra games are no problem for us. If it is a top Premier League team next, we will take that,” added the man who also featured when Wigan beat another top-flight side Bournemouth in a third round replay.\nGrigg will be looking for more giant-killing fare in the fifth round, having also scored twice for MK Dons when they beat Manchester United 4-0 in the League Cup in 2014.\nReporting by Ian Chadband; Editing by Christian Radnedge\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-01-28T03:02:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-28T01:00:35.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
