Fernando Karadima, who was found guilty in a Vatican investigation in 2011 of abusing teenage boys over many years. Karadima denies the allegations, and Barros said he was unaware of any wrongdoing. \nBarros and his main accusers were not available to comment on the latest twist of a long-running saga that has gripped Chile and severely hurt the Church’s prestige there. \nDuring the trip, a Chilean reporter managed to get close to the pope at an event and shouted out a question about Barros.

There is not a single piece of evidence against him. It is all slander. Is that clear?” the pope replied in a snippy tone. \nHis comments were seen as trying to dismiss the credibility of accusers and was widely criticised by victims, their advocates and newspaper editorials in Chile and the pope’s native Argentina. \nEven Cardinal Sean O‘Malley of Boston, a key papal adviser on how to root out sexual abuse in the Church, distanced himself with a statement saying the pope had caused “great pain”.

REUTERS/Alessandro Bianchi/File Photo \nSpeaking to reporters on the plane returning to Rome, Francis, in an extremely rare act of self-criticism, apologised to victims, acknowledging that his choice of words and tone of voice had “wounded many”. \nOne of Barros’ accusers, Juan Carlo Cruz, has said the bishop was present when Karadima abused him. He said he was shocked that the Vatican had said it had no evidence against the bishop. \n“As if I could have taken a selfie or photo while Karadima abused me and others with Juan Barros standing next to him watching everything,” he tweeted on Jan. 18, during the pope’s visit. \nVictims and their advocates have said Francis should never have appointed Barros because there had been accusations against him. Anti-Barros parishioners demonstrated during his investiture ceremony in 2015. \nWhile the pope, who met two victims in Chile during the trip, has vowed “zero tolerance” of sexual abuse, a planned Vatican tribunal to judge bishops accused of covering up abuse or mishandling cases has never started. \nThe much-touted commission O‘Malley heads has meanwhile been hit by defections by high-profile non-clerical members who quit in frustration over what they said was lack of progress.
