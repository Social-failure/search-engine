The bulk of its stores are in France while it is also present in Spain, Switzerland, Portugal, Luxembourg, Italy, Croatia and Serbia. $1 = 0.8106 euros Reporting by Dominique Vidalon; Editing by Sudip Kar-Gupta", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-24T14:52:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-24T15:29:41.016+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
