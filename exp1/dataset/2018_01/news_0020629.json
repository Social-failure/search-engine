More than 10,000 people have been killed in the conflict.\nYemen, a nation of 28 million people, imports more than 85 percent of its food and medicine.\nThe ports have temporarily re-opened for 30 days, and cranes arrived on Monday to help with the aid flow, but it’s unclear if they will stay that way, said Stephen Anderson, Yemen country director for the World Food Programme (WFP).\n“If the ports are restricted again we could face a catastrophic loss of life if we can’t get supplies to people,” he told the Thomson Reuters Foundation by phone from Hodeidah on Monday.\nYemenis are facing “an extremely bleak outlook”, with continued conflict, high fuel and food prices and disease concerns such as the cholera outbreak and the spread of diphtheria, Anderson added.\nDisrupting humanitarian access would deepen what the United Nations already calls the world’s worst humanitarian crisis, said Rosanne Marchesich, a Rome-based emergency response team leader at the U.N.’s Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO).\nIn 2017, 17 million Yemenis, or about two-thirds of the population, were considered hungry, with 6.8 million needing immediate, adequate and sustained food assistance, WFP said.\nThe numbers have gone up with 8.4 million now on the brink of famine, it added.\nWith 70 percent of the rural population dependent on agriculture for food and income, sustaining production is crucial, FAO’s Marchesich told the Thomson Reuters Foundation by phone.\nYet, below average rainfall, fighting and limited, expensive inputs such as fertilizers, have pushed down yields, she added.\nYemenis have exhausted strategies to cope with the crisis and some are selling off their assets for short-term survival, deepening poverty and food insecurity, she warned.\nReporting By Heba Kanso and Thin Lei Win, Editing by Ros Russell and Jared Ferrie; Please credit the Thomson Reuters Foundation, the charitable arm of Thomson Reuters, that covers humanitarian news, women's rights, corruption and climate change.
