This confidence is the result of preliminary fiscal third quarter revenue of $23.8 million, strong backlog entering the fiscal fourth quarter and continuing sales wins. The company also expects to report fiscal third quarter EBITDA and earnings per share in line with analyst consensus estimates exclusive of one-time severance expenses incurred during the quarter. Xplore intends to report full results of the quarter in February 2018.\nFiscal third quarter sales included deliveries to leading global customers across a diverse range of targeted vertical markets, including telecommunications, automotive manufacturing, military, consumer service and pharmaceutical customers. Xplore also secured notable orders from a global fast food company, the Veteran’s Administration and a leading national car rental company.\n“We continue to execute well, including solid sales in the December quarter and a positive outlook for our fiscal fourth quarter,” said acting CEO Tom Wilkinson. “We are confident that this execution puts Xplore on track to achieve the upper end of our previous revenue target for the full fiscal year. As we enter 2018, demand for Xplore rugged tablets is strong, backlog remains high and the entire team at Xplore is motivated by our transformation into a rugged mobility company.”\nAbout Xplore Technologies\nXplore is The Rugged Tablet Authority™, exclusively manufacturing powerful, long-lasting, and customer-defined rugged tablet PCs since 1996.
