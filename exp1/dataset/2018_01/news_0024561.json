Continued foreign buying is a positive sign,” said Hussain Gani, Deputy CEO at Softlogic Stockbrokers. \nShares in conglomerate John Keells Holdings Plc ended 2.7 percent down, while biggest listed lender Commercial Bank of Ceylon Plc dropped 0.5 percent and Hatton National Bank Plc ended 0.8 percent weaker. \n“Investors will wait and see how the local elections will be.” \nSri Lanka will hold a long-delayed local government election on Feb. 10. \nThe bourse hit a near two-month high on Monday as declining interest rates and expectations of higher economic growth boosted investor appetite for risky assets. \nTreasury bill rates fell between March and December last year, mainly driven by foreign buying in treasury bonds, resulting in a decline in interest rates. \nSri Lanka’s economic growth in 2018 is forecast at 5-5.5 percent, against an anticipated four-year low of less than 4 percent last year, central bank governor Indrajit Coomaraswamy said last week. \nSri Lanka’s stock, bond, and foreign exchange markets are closed on Monday for a holiday and normal trading will resume on Tuesday.
