Andrei Vasilevskiy, the NHL leader in wins (27) and shutouts (six), made 26 saves but has now surrendered 19 goals in his last four games.\nThe Golden Knights, who rallied from a 2-0 deficit to defeat the Lightning 4-3 on a Shea Theodore goal with 2.3 seconds remaining on Dec. 19 in Las Vegas, swept the regular-season series with Tampa Bay, which lost for the fourth time in six games.\nVegas, coming in off a 1-0 loss at Nashville on Tuesday that saw Predators’ goalie Juuse Saros make 43 saves, needed only 56 seconds to score Thursday. Neal redirected a wrist shot from the right point by defenseman Deryk Engelland, who garnered his 100th career point with the assist. It was Neal’s 19th goal of the season.\nSchmidt made it 2-0 at 16:03 with a one-timer off a Brayden McNabb pass that knuckled over the left shoulder of Vasilevskiy.\nTampa Bay closed to within 2-1 midway through the second period when Palat jammed in a pass from Steven Stamkos from the right side of the crease.\nPerron, using a nifty toe drag to get around defenseman Anton Stralman, answered with his 10th goal of the year -- the sixth Vegas player to reach double digits -- snapping in a wrist shot from the slot at 17:43 of the second period.\nThe Golden Knights made it 4-1 just 18 seconds into the third period when Karlsson rifled a wrist shot from the top of the right circle past Vasilevsky’s blocker for his 24th goal of the season.\nThe Lightning played without All-Star defenseman and 2017 Norris Trophy finalist Victor Hedman, who is expected to miss three to six weeks after sustaining a lower-body injury in Tampa Bay’s final game before the bye week, a 5-1 loss to Calgary on Jan. 11.\n--Field Level Media\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-01-19T11:40:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-19T12:15:36.015+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
