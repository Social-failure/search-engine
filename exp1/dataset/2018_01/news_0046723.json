(NASDAQ:ABTX) (\"Allegiance\"), the holding company of Allegiance Bank (the \"Bank\"), today reported net income of $3.2 million in the fourth quarter 2017 compared to $5.8 million in the fourth quarter 2016 and diluted earnings per share of $0.24 in the fourth quarter 2017 compared to $0.44 in the fourth quarter 2016. The fourth quarter 2017 results included a $2.6 million increase in the tax provision as a result of the revaluation of the deferred tax asset due to the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act and $1.1 million in core technology conversion costs. Net income for the year ended December 31, 2017 was $17.6 million, or $1.31 per diluted common share, compared to net income of $22.9 million, or $1.75 per diluted common share, for the year ended December 31, 2016. The year ended December 31, 2016 included an after-tax gain of $1.3 million on the sale of two Central Texas branch locations.\n\"This was a sound year for Allegiance as we continued to consistently generate loan growth into the fourth quarter, while maintaining solid credit quality and a strong net interest margin,\" said George Martinez, Allegiance's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. \"Our fourth quarter earnings were impacted by the recent tax reform bill enacted at the end of December which led to a revaluation of our deferred tax asset resulting in a $2.6 million tax adjustment. We remain focused on the execution of our growth strategies as we further strengthened our capital position through the successful completion of a subordinated debt offering in December. Additionally, we made a strategic decision to implement a new core technology platform in the first half of 2018 to a more integrated technology solution reflective of our vision to better leverage technology to achieve our goals and realize operational efficiencies in our super community banking model. This new platform will not only better position us to meet the current and future needs and demands of our customers, but also enhance the user experience for customers and employees alike,\" continued Martinez.\n\"I am very pleased with our momentum and achievements over this past year. Among those achievements are robust capital, continued customer growth, and strength in asset quality. We anticipate a sustained focus and continued progress in the coming year toward attaining our strategic goals of high quality growth with improving levels of profitability. As such, I am grateful for our dedicated employees, who add value to our customer relationships and provide superior service and innovation. They ensure a consistent customer experience at Allegiance, just as they have done throughout our 10-year history, and I appreciate their hard work and loyalty,\" concluded Martinez.\nFourth Quarter 2017 Results\nNet interest income before provision for loan losses in the fourth quarter 2017 increased $4.0 million, or 17.1%, to $27.4 million from $23.4 million for the fourth quarter 2016 primarily due to organic loan growth.

Allegiance believes that these non-GAAP financial measures provide meaningful supplemental information regarding its performance. Allegiance believes that management and investors benefit from referring to these non-GAAP financial measures in assessing Allegiance’s performance and when planning, forecasting, analyzing and comparing past, present and future periods. Specifically, Allegiance reviews tangible book value per common share, return on average tangible equity and the ratio of tangible equity to tangible assets for internal planning and forecasting purposes. Additionally, Allegiance excluded the one time sale of two Central Texas branch locations during the first quarter 2016 as noted within the narrative, as Allegiance believes this transaction was not indicative of its recurring operating results. Allegiance has included in this Earnings Release information relating to these non-GAAP financial measures for the applicable periods presented. These non-GAAP measures should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the most directly comparable or other financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. Moreover, the manner in which Allegiance calculates the non-GAAP financial measures may differ from that of other companies reporting measures with similar names.\nThree Months Ended Year Ended 2017 2016 2017 2016 December 31 September 30 June 30 March 31 December 31 December 31 December 31 (Dollars and share amounts in thousands, except per share data) Total shareholders' equity $ 306,865 $ 302,727 $ 298,459 $ 289,130 $ 279,817 $ 306,865 $ 279,817 Less: Goodwill and core deposit intangibles, net 42,663 42,858 43,053 43,249 43,444 42,663 43,444 Tangible shareholders’ equity $ 264,202 $ 259,869 $ 255,406 $ 245,881 $ 236,373 $ 264,202 $ 236,373 Shares outstanding at end of period 13,227 13,171 13,153 13,080 12,958 13,227 12,958 Tangible book value per share $ 19.97 $ 19.73 $ 19.42 $ 18.80 $ 18.24 $ 19.97 $ 18.24 Net income attributable to shareholders $ 3,204 $ 2,986 $ 5,395 $ 6,047 $ 5,771 $ 17,632 $ 22,851 Average shareholders' equity $ 306,346 $ 303,449 $ 295,524 $ 284,889 $ 278,123 $ 297,627 $ 273,211 Less: Average goodwill and core deposit intangibles, net 42,758 42,954 43,149 43,345 43,539 43,050 43,880 Average tangible shareholders’ equity $ 263,588 $ 260,495 $ 252,375 $ 241,544 $ 234,584 $ 254,577 $ 229,331 Return on average tangible equity 4.82 % 4.55 % 8.57 % 10.15 % 9.79 % 6.93 % 9.96 % Total assets $ 2,860,231 $ 2,813,434 $ 2,724,716 $ 2,592,330 $ 2,450,948 $ 2,860,231 $ 2,450,948 Less: Goodwill and core deposit intangibles, net 42,663 42,858 43,053 43,249 43,444 42,663 43,444 Tangible assets $ 2,817,568 $ 2,770,576 $ 2,681,663 $ 2,549,081 $ 2,407,504 $ 2,817,568 $ 2,407,504 Tangible equity to tangible assets 9.38 % 9.38 % 9.52 % 9.65 % 9.82 % 9.38 % 9.82 % Allegiance Bancshares, Inc.\n8847 West Sam Houston Parkway N., Suite 200\nHouston, Texas 77040\nir@allegiancebank.com\nSource:Allegiance Bancshares, Inc.", "external_links": ["https://www.globenewswire.com/NewsRoom/AttachmentNg/0decac7e-dbe7-48f0-85f7-5af335abb00c"], "published": "2018-01-25T15:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-25T16:25:29.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
