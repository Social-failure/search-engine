(NYSE: OGS) today announced that its 2018 net income is expected to be in the range of $156 million to $168 million, or $2.96 to $3.20 per diluted share. The midpoint for ONE Gas' 2018 net income guidance is $162 million, or $3.08 per diluted share.\nONE Gas' 2018 earnings guidance primarily reflects the benefit of new rates and normal weather in its service territories and a $0.04 per diluted share contribution from the share-based compensation accounting standard that was adopted in the first quarter of 2017. These benefits are offset partially by higher depreciation expense due to capital investments. The impacts of the recently signed tax reform legislation and expected regulatory treatment have also been incorporated into guidance. ONE Gas expects to achieve a 7.3 percent return on equity (ROE) in 2018, which assumes an average rate base of $3.4 billion and is calculated consistent with utility ratemaking in each jurisdiction.\nONE Gas also increased its 2017 net income guidance to $3.06 to $3.10 per diluted share, compared with its previously announced range of $2.94 to $3.04 per diluted share. Included in the 2017 EPS guidance range is $0.10 per share contribution from adoption of the share-based compensation accounting standard in the first quarter of 2017, which was included in the previous guidance. Also included in the updated guidance is a $0.07 per share contribution from the accounting authority order approved by the Kansas Corporation Commission in the fourth quarter of 2017 and a $0.04 per share negative impact from the recently signed tax reform legislation, neither of which were included in the previous guidance.\nCapital expenditures are expected to be $375 million in 2018, with 70 percent of these expenditures targeted for system integrity and replacement projects.\nGuidance estimates may be impacted by the variables listed in the forward-looking statements below. Additional information is available in the guidance table on the ONE Gas website.\nFIVE-YEAR GROWTH FORECAST UPDATED\nONE Gas expects net income and earnings per share to increase by an average of 5 to 7 percent annually between 2017 and 2022; however, the timing and frequency of regulatory filings will impact the growth rate in any individual year. ONE Gas' rate base is expected to grow an average of 6.0 to 6.5 percent per year between 2017 and 2022.\nCapital expenditures are expected to be in the range of $375 million to $415 million per year between 2018 and 2022, with more than 70 percent of these expenditures targeted for system integrity and replacement projects. ONE Gas' previous five-year capital expenditures guidance range was $350 million to $380 million per year between 2017 and 2021.\nONE Gas expects its average annual dividend growth rate to be 7 to 9 percent between 2017 and 2022, with a target dividend payout ratio of 55 to 65 percent of net income, all subject to its board of directors' approval.\nLINK TO GUIDANCE TABLE\nhttp://www.onegas.com/~/media/OGS/Guidance/2018/OGS_2018_Guidance-1kKdr_Q439MdKZw.ashx\nONE Gas, Inc.
