In October, Reuters reported Primavera Capital Group and CITIC Private Equity were planning to raise new dollar-denominated funds totaling around $5 billion. \nSome Chinese companies had been planning to set up project-based private equity funds offshore to better fund their overseas investments, according to people familiar with the companies’ plans. \nMany funds have used China’s Silk Road initiative, also known as the Belt and Road program, as a plank for raising money from global investors outside the country. The goal is to spur railways, power grids and other infrastructure projects central, western and southern Asia, as well as Africa and Europe. \nBig state-owned banks including China Construction Bank Corp ( 601988.SS ) and Bank of China ( 601988.SS ) aim to raise billions of dollars from onshore and offshore investors to fund such projects. \nBut greater disclosure demands could undermine investor enthusiasm for offshore funds for these purposes. \n“The government would be reaching too far and make it challenging for Chinese funds to operate offshore,” said a Beijing-based senior private equity lawyer, who did not have direct knowledge of the plans but was asked about is potential impact. \n“Which would be great news to international funds - don’t trust Chinese funds,” he said. “They would give your information to the government!” Reporting by Kane Wu and Summet Chatterjee; additional reporting by Julie Zhu in Hong Kong and Stella Qiu in Beijing; Editing by Malcolm Foster", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-25T04:52:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-25T05:06:32.002+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
