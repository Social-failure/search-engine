If you happen to be in the market for a crib (i.e. you’re pregnant), then you can score a discount on your purchase by peeing on the ad to reveal a coupon. \nThe bottom of the ad uses a similar technology to your standard pregnancy test, except rather than seeing a simple “yes” message when it detects your pregnancy, the page will give you deals, AdWeek reports . Ikea wants you to pee on this ad and if you’re pregnant, it'll give you a discount on a crib https://t.co/MjuUiQSkZz pic.twitter.com/wAMXt8IdkJ \n— Adweek (@Adweek) January 9, 2018 \nPresumably, you’ll then need to bring the urine-soaked paper to your local Ikea to redeem it. \nRequiring a medical test to get a discount on a product that you would literally only need if the test results are positive is certainly a little out of the ordinary and can be construed as a sexist (which wouldn’t be the first time for Ikea ) and potentially alienating move by the retailer. \nIt also means cashiers in Sweden will need to be ready to collect some pee-covered coupons and expecting moms will need to carry them around in their purse, which sounds like an awful time for everyone involved.
