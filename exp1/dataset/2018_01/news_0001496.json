REUTERS/Susana Vera \nState prosecutors asked the Supreme Court to keep Junqueras in Estremera prison, outside Madrid, court officials said, which would prevent him from swearing in at the opening session of the new Catalan parliament on Jan. 17. \nA Dec. 21 regional election gave separatists a slim majority in the parliament in a blow to Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy, who had hoped it would quash the Catalan independence movement and resolve Spain’s worst political crisis in decades. \nJunqueras’s Esquerra Republicana (Republican Left) party emerged as the second largest separatist group, a few seats behind former Catalan President Carles Puigdemont’s Junts per Catalunya (Together for Catalonia) party. \nMarket-friendly party Ciudadanos (Citizens) won the most seats but other unionist parties did not secure enough votes to form a majority.

REUTERS/Susana Vera \nPuigdemont remains in self-imposed exile in Brussels, though he has said he would return to Catalonia if the Spanish government gave him certain “guarantees”, likely a promise not to arrest him. \nEsquerra lawmakers have said Puigdemont has the right to again be Catalan president, but if he is unable to return from Brussels he should step aside for Junqueras. Esquerra and Junts per Catalunya, along with a smaller separatist party, have not yet agreed on a coalition.

REUTERS/Susana Vera \nJunqueras said at the Thursday hearing he was a “man of peace” and of “dialogue,” his lawyer Andreu Van Den Eynde told reporters outside the courthouse. He is in custody on allegations of rebellion, sedition and misuse of public funds. \nThe court said it would not reach a decision on Thursday. \nRajoy fired both Junqueras and Puigdemont when he imposed direct control over Catalonia after the separatist-controlled government declared independence following an Oct. 1 referendum on secession from Spain, which courts ruled illegal. \nThe political instability in Catalonia, which accounts for a fifth of Spain’s economy, has deterred tourists and prompted more than 3,000 companies, including the region’s two biggest banks, to move their legal headquarters elsewhere in Spain.
