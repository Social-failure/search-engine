A few days after being told he was no longer in the running, the former George W.

Trump's team stopped returning Cha's calls in December after the strategist made his concerns known about attacking the North, the FT continued, noting that Cha was reportedly asked whether he could help manage the evacuation of American citizens from South Korea .\nshow chapters North Korea wants to divide the alliance between the U.S. and South Korea      2:06 AM ET Fri, 26 Jan 2018 | 02:08 In his Tuesday op-ed, Cha acknowledged that he had shared his reservations about the strike with the administration.\nSome Trump officials, Cha wrote, believe military action will force Pyongyang to the negotiating table, but that places U.S. citizens in Asia's fourth-largest economy at risk of North Korean retaliation.\n\"The president would be putting at risk an American population the size of a medium-size U.S. city — Pittsburgh, say, or Cincinnati — on the assumption that a crazy and undeterrable dictator will be rationally cowed by a demonstration of U.S. kinetic power.\"\nRead Cha's op-ed in the Washington Post.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-31T07:21:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-31T07:22:48.002+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
