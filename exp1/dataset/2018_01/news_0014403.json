PROMESA gave the board authority to push Puerto Rico into a court-supervised restructuring akin to U.S. bankruptcy, which it did in May.\nSince then, the board has pushed for drastic repayments cuts to bondholders like Aurelius, which holds around $468 million of Puerto Rico's debt.\nAurelius says board members are federal officers, and under the appointments clause should have been appointed by the U.S. president, and confirmed by the Senate.\n\"The president had to choose appointees from lawmakers' lists,\" Olson said. \"Congress cannot put the president in that kind of box.\"\nBy no means an effort to free Puerto Rico from federal oversight, Aurelius wants the bankruptcy nixed and, possibly, the reappointment of new board members by incumbent Republican President Donald Trump.\nCLASH OF LEGAL TITANS\nIts case is viewed as a long-shot, but the hedge fund, known for aggressive litigation, pulled out all the stops in tapping Olson.\nIn addition to his role as solicitor general, Olson is famous for representing Bush in 2000's Bush v. Gore U.S. Supreme Court case, as well as challenging California's \"Proposition 8\" ban on same-sex marriage.\nFor its part, the board hired ex-Obama Solicitor General Donald Verrilli, who argued on Wednesday that the board is \"funded 100 percent out of the treasury of Puerto Rico,\" and that its members are officers of that island, not the United States.\nVerrilli warned that Aurelius' argument could call into question the federal government's 1947 decision allowing Puerto Ricans to elect their own governor, potentially threatening Puerto Rico's very right to self-rule.\nThe U.S. Department of Justice sided with the board, calling PROMESA \"unquestionably constitutional.\"\n\"Despite all the former solicitor generals in the room today, we don't feel this one is that close,\" DOJ lawyer Thomas Ward said.\nThe case is In re: Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, 17-3283, in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York.
