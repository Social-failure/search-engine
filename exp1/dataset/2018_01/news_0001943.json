Despite previously petitioning the EPA four times in 2016 to crack down on the upwind pollution, the governor said the state has not gotten relief. \n”We are simply asking that the EPA require these power plants that pollute Delaware’s air to run their existing pollution control equipment when the plants are in operation,” the governor said. \nDelaware’s Department of Natural Resources and Environmental Control said that although the state has made strides in improving its air quality, out-of-state emissions keep it from meeting federal air quality standards. \n“It is now time for EPA to hold upwind sources accountable for ozone emissions that are impacting downwind states,” the department’s secretary, Shawn Garvin, said.
