You have then gained their trust and they know what’s coming when they fail to deliver.” \nThe memo’s release comes just days after British outsourcer Carillion ( CLLN.L ), was forced into bankruptcy after failing to agree a debt deal with lenders including RBS, which court documents showed had demanded even tougher terms before the collapse. \nMcEwan, in a written response to TSC Chairman Nicky Morgan, said the memo was never part of RBS’s policy and had only ever been circulated within one regional office, as well as two GRG offices. \n“For the avoidance of doubt, the language used in the document was completely unacceptable and the bank does not condone it,” McEwan wrote. \nIn October, Britain’s financial watchdog told RBS to speed up its handling of compensation claims related to GRG, which has been accused by customers of driving them to bankruptcy in order to pick up their assets on the cheap.
