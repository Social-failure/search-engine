(NASDAQ:UCBI) (“United”) today announced its fourth quarter financial results. Although remeasurement of United’s deferred tax assets following December’s historic tax reform legislation led to a net loss for the quarter of $11.9 million or 16 cents per diluted share, strong margin expansion, disciplined expense controls and solid credit quality drove strong pre-tax results.\nOn an operating basis, United reported net income of $32.5 million for the fourth quarter of 2017 compared with $28.9 million for the fourth quarter of 2016. Fourth quarter 2017 operating net income excludes the $38.2 million impact of remeasuring United’s deferred tax assets, as well as merger-related and other non-operating charges totaling $6.19 million, net of the associated income tax benefit. Fourth quarter 2016 operating net income excludes $709,000 in merger-related charges, net of the associated income tax benefit and a $976,000 tax charge for the impairment of our deferred tax asset on cancelled non-qualified stock options. On a per diluted share basis, operating net income was 42 cents for the fourth quarter of 2017 compared with 40 cents for the fourth quarter of 2016.\nAt December 31, 2017, preliminary regulatory capital ratios were as follows: Tier 1 Risk-Based of 12.3 percent; Total Risk-Based of 13.0 percent; Common Equity Tier 1 Risk-Based of 12.0 percent, and Tier 1 Leverage of 9.4 percent.\n“We achieved solid pre-tax financial results for the fourth quarter, marking a strong end to another exceptional year of achievement for United Community Banks,” said Jimmy Tallent, chairman and chief executive officer. “Looking back over the year, I am encouraged by all that we achieved. In 2017, we continued our strategic expansion by merging with two outstanding community banks that both extend and enhance our footprint in thriving new markets. We completed the acquisition of Horry County State Bank on July 31, significantly enhancing our presence in the Myrtle Beach area along the South Carolina coast. We completed the acquisition of Four Oaks Bank & Trust Company on November 1, extending our footprint in and around the Raleigh, North Carolina metropolitan statistical area. All systems conversions for the Horry County State Bank acquisition were completed in the fourth quarter and we are scheduled to convert Four Oaks to United’s systems in early 2018, at which time we expect to fully realize the anticipated cost savings. Both of these banks share our customer service culture and are exceptional partners for extending our footprint. I could not be more pleased with these partnerships and I am thrilled to welcome them to the United family.\"\nTallent continued, “A few weeks ago we announced a merger with NLFC Holdings Corp. and its wholly-owned subsidiary, Navitas Credit Corp. Navitas Credit Corp. is a premier specialty lender providing equipment finance services to small and medium-sized businesses nationwide with headquarters in Ponte Vedra, Florida. This fast-growing company will be a solid strategic addition to our existing specialty and commercial lending businesses and will enable us to further expand our client offerings. Navitas will continue to be run by their talented team of industry veterans. This partnership brings exceptional growth and a significant profitability enhancement to United and a permanent source of capital and low-cost funding to Navitas. The partnership with Navitas is a solid win for both of us and I am excited to welcome them to United Community Bank.\n“While the passage of tax reform legislation in late December will have a substantial and ongoing positive impact on United’s earnings beginning in the first quarter of 2018, the required remeasurement of United’s deferred tax assets resulted in a $38.2 million non-cash charge to tax expense in the fourth quarter,” stated Tallent. “The charge results because our net deferred tax assets will now be recovered at the lower federal income tax rate of 21 percent rather than the previous rate of 35 percent. Despite the charge, we believe tax reform legislation will be good for United, our industry, our customers and our shareholders not only because it reduces our tax burden going forward but we also expect it to stimulate the economy and drive growth.\n“Fourth quarter loan production was $644 million with $440 million originating from our community banks and $204 million from our Commercial Banking Solutions group,” Tallent added. “Linked-quarter loans were up $533 million, mostly reflecting the $486 million in net loans received through our acquisition of Four Oaks. Our indirect auto loan portfolio was down $42.1 million from third quarter reflecting our decision to suspend indirect auto loan purchases. Excluding the reduction in indirect auto loans and the loans acquired through the Four Oaks acquisition, loan growth was up at an annualized rate of approximately five percent from the third quarter.”\nFourth quarter net interest revenue totaled $97.5 million, up $16.6 million from the fourth quarter of 2016 and up $7.7 million from the third quarter. The increases from both periods reflect business growth and net interest margin expansions of 29 basis points from a year ago and nine basis points from the third quarter. The increases were mostly driven by rising short-term interest rates, the repayment of senior notes in August and October, as well as the acquisitions of Four Oaks Bank & Trust Company on November 1, 2017 and Horry County State Bank on July 31, 2017. Four Oaks Bank & Trust Company and Horry County State Bank results are included in United’s financial results beginning on their respective acquisition date.\nThe fourth quarter provision for credit losses was $1.2 million, up from $1.0 million for the third quarter and no provision in fourth quarter 2016. Fourth quarter net charge-offs totaled $1.1 million, down from $1.6 million in the third quarter of 2017 and $1.5 million in the fourth quarter of 2016. Contributing to the low level of net charge-offs were continued strong recoveries of previously charged-off loans. Nonperforming assets were .23 percent of total assets at December 31, 2017, compared with .28 percent at December 31, 2016 and .23 percent at September 30, 2017.\n“Credit quality remains strong and steady as indicated by the low level of net charge-offs,” Tallent commented. “Our credit quality indicators show no indication of credit deterioration and our outlook is for that to continue. We also expect our provision levels to gradually increase each quarter due to loan growth, while our allowance and the related ratio to total loans may decline slightly.”\nFourth quarter fee revenue totaled $21.9 million, down $3.31 million from a year ago but up $1.36 million from the third quarter. The decrease from a year ago was mostly due to lower debit card interchange fees as a result of the Durbin amendment becoming effective for United on July 1, 2017. The application of the Durbin amendment reduced United’s debit card interchange fees by approximately $2.7 million in both the third and fourth quarters. Also contributing to the decrease from both prior periods were lower mortgage fees and lower customer derivative fees reflecting a less favorable interest rate environment.\nOperating expenses were $75.9 million for the fourth quarter, compared with $61.3 million for the fourth quarter of 2016 and $65.7 million for the third quarter. Included in the fourth quarter’s operating expenses are $7.36 million in merger-related expenses. We also had merger-related charges of $1.14 million in the fourth quarter of 2016, and $2.3 million in merger-related expenses and $1.1 million in surplus property impairment charges, totaling $3.4 million in the third quarter of 2017. Excluding these charges, fourth quarter operating expenses were $68.5 million compared with $62.3 million for the third quarter and $60.2 million a year ago. More than half of the $6.3 million increase from the third quarter was due to the operating expenses of Four Oaks Bank & Trust Company acquired on November 1, 2017 and Horry County State Bank acquired on July 31, 2017. Higher incentives for exceeding performance targets contributed to the increase from third quarter and accounted for approximately half of the linked quarter increase in salaries and benefits with the rest of the increase in salaries and benefits coming from the acquisitions.\nTallent concluded, “2017 was another exceptional year for United Community Banks. We completed two outstanding acquisitions that extend our footprint in thriving markets with bankers who share our culture of customer service. Our bankers produced solid financial results allowing us to absorb the loss of revenue resulting from the application of the Durbin amendment and the higher deposit insurance assessment and still produce growth in earnings per share. That alone was a tremendous accomplishment. Every day our bankers demonstrate their passion and commitment which drive our performance and ensure our success. With an outstanding 2017 now behind us, I look forward with eager anticipation to all our bankers will accomplish in 2018.”\nConference Call\nUnited will hold a conference call Wednesday, January 24, 2018, at 11 a.m. ET to discuss the contents of this press release and to share business highlights for the quarter.
