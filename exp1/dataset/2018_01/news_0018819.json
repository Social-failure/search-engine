We had two flat tyres at the beginning and afterwards we took care because we didn’t have any spares,” al-Attiyah told the Dakar website.

REUTERS/Andres Stapff \n“At the first dunes, we went into a big hole and got stuck for 30 minutes, before it happened a second time. We lost pressure in one of the tyres. We tried to put air back in and we were stuck again for 30 or 20 minutes.” \nPeterhansel also suffered low tyre pressure and had to stop and make a change, losing several minutes. He then made a navigation error towards the end. \nCyril Despres, who had led after the second stage, saw his chances of winning a sixth title after five on bikes effectively disappear when he broke a rear wheel on his Peugeot and had to wait for assistance. \nIn the bikes, Sunderland crashed while leading and had to be flown out by helicopter. \nHis exit meant that Yamaha’s French rider Adrian van Beveren took over the lead, one minute and 55 seconds clear of Chilean Pablo Quintanilla, after winning the stage. \nWednesday’s fifth stage sees the bikes and quads take a different route to the cars and trucks, with all ending up in Arequipa on the last full day in Peru before heading for Bolivia.
