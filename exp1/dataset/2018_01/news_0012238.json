Senior officials said privately in recent weeks that he would likely take that step.\nPena Nieto named Roberto Campa, of the New Alliance party and former undersecretary for human rights, as the new labor secretary.\nReporting by Diego Ore and Veronica Gomez; Editing by Dave Graham and Peter Cooney\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-01-11T03:52:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-11T03:56:11.002+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
