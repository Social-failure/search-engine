Same Look, New Terrible Taste \nIn 2015, P&G started coating the pods in a bitter-tasting substance . The adjustment, which came three years after the 2012 launch of the product, was aimed at preventing children from biting into the pods. If the current spate of poison control cases is any indication, it hasn’t discouraged their adolescent counterparts. 3. Intra-Internet cooperation \nThe company has worked with YouTube and Facebook to take down “Tide Pod Challenge” posts, which are thought to be responsible for the recent rise in oral consumption. Though there are debates about the extent to which social media platforms should be involved in policing content, both platforms have cooperated with P&G to remove posts as quickly as possible on the basis that they encourage harmful behavior. 4. Calling In the Big Guns \nPatriots tight end Rob Gronkowski, who is also a spokesperson for Tide , recorded a video for the brand’s social media channels in which he advised on the dangers of eating Tide Pods. What should Tide PODs be used for? DOING LAUNDRY. Nothing else. \nEating a Tide POD is a BAD IDEA, and we asked our friend @robgronkowski to help explain. pic.twitter.com/0JnFdhnsWZ \nNo word yet on what this has done to consumption among fans of all other NFL teams. \nP&G, Facebook, and YouTube were not immediately available for comment.
