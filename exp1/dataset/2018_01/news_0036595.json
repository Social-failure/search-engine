However, Hellebuyck picked up his second win in two nights as both clubs were playing the second of back-to-back games after coming off their league-mandated five-day break.\nVancouver goaltender Anders Nilsson bore the loss despite stopping 35 of 36 shots. The Canucks, who were outshot 36-29, took their second loss in a row.\nLaine produced the game’s only goal 11:45 into the first period, converting a shot from the slot after Blake Wheeler fed him the puck from the corner. Kyle Connor also was credited with an assist.\nIt looked as if the Jets would increase their lead just before the second intermission, but Nilsson robbed Mathieu Perreault on a two-on-one with Nikolaj Ehlers in the dying seconds.\nLaine had an excellent chance to pot his second goal of the game early in the third period, but he hit the post after beating Nilsson with a deke.\nWith just over six minutes gone in the final frame, Hellebuyck came way out of his net to foil Markus Granlund on a breakaway, and Brandon Sutter than rang the rebound off the post. Near the 11:30 mark, Wheeler hit the post and was denied by Nilsson on the ensuing rebound.\nHellebuyck suffered a cut near his eye with 3:39 left in the third period as the tip of teammate Josh Morrisey’s stick went through the wires in his mask while he was tangling with Vancouver winger Thomas Vanek. Hellebuyck was tended by a trainer at the Jets’ bench and stayed in the game.\nThe Canucks received a power play with 1:30 left as Connor was penalized for hooking Sutter. However, Vancouver could not beat Hellebuyck even after pulling Nilsson for a sixth attacker and a two-man advantage.\nCenter Bo Horvat returned to Vancouver’s lineup after being sidelined since Dec. 5 with a broken foot. Meanwhile, Canucks defenseman Erik Gudbranson missed the game due to back spasms.\n--Field Level Media\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-01-22T12:07:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-22T20:43:01.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
