After adjusting for the effects of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (the “Tax Act”), the financial results included core earnings attributable to the company’s common stock of $83 million and $317 million for the fourth-quarter and full-year 2017, respectively, reflecting core earnings per diluted share increases of 22 percent and 35 percent, respectively, compared to the year-ago periods. Absent the effect of the Tax Act, core earnings growth was driven by a 22-percent increase in the private education loan portfolio, an improved net interest margin, and operating efficiency improvements. The Tax Act was signed into law on Dec. 22, 2017.\n“We are pleased 2017 was another solid year as evidenced by customer experience innovations, continued improvements in our net interest margin, sound credit trends, increased operating efficiency, and an expanding market share, which all contributed to our strong earnings growth,” said Raymond J. Quinlan, chairman and CEO. “Recent tax legislation will increase our earnings, resulting in both higher profits and the opportunity to invest in service upgrades, technological efficiencies, and diversified product offerings, all of which will strengthen our franchise for the future.”\nFor the fourth-quarter 2017, GAAP net income was $47 million, compared with $70 million in the year-ago quarter. GAAP net income attributable to the company’s common stock was $44 million ($0.10 diluted earnings per share) in the fourth-quarter 2017, compared with $65 million ($0.15 diluted earnings per share) in the year-ago quarter. The year-over-year decrease was primarily attributable to the required accounting treatment for the effects of the Tax Act.\nThe Tax Act lowered federal corporate tax rates from 35 percent to 21 percent, beginning in 2018. Because the Tax Act was enacted during the fourth-quarter 2017, the company was required to reflect the application of the lower tax rate in future years to its deferred tax assets, liabilities and indemnification receivables. Therefore, at Dec. 31, 2017, the company recorded a provisional estimate which resulted in a $15 million net increase in tax expense and reduced non-interest income by $24 million to reflect the effect of the lower tax rate. Absent the impact of the Tax Act, GAAP net income would have been $86 million and GAAP net income attributable to the company’s common stock would have been $82 million ($0.19 diluted earnings per share) in the fourth-quarter 2017. For a reconciliation of the effect of the Tax Act on the GAAP Consolidated Statements of Income of the company, see page 11 of this release.\nFor 2017, GAAP net income was $289 million, compared with $250 million in 2016. GAAP net income attributable to the company’s common stock was $273 million ($0.62 diluted earnings per share) in 2017, compared with $229 million ($0.53 diluted earnings per share) in 2016. Absent the impact of the Tax Act, GAAP net income would have been $328 million, and GAAP net income attributable to the company’s common stock would have been $312 million ($0.71 diluted earnings per share) in 2017.\nFourth-quarter 2017 results vs. fourth-quarter 2016 included:\nPrivate education loan originations of $634 million, up 4 percent. Net interest income of $309 million, up 26 percent. Net interest margin of 6.00 percent, up 45 basis points. Average private education loans outstanding of $17.3 billion, up 23 percent. Average yield on the private education loan portfolio was 8.61 percent, up 53 basis points. Private education loan provision for loan losses was $49 million, up from $43 million. Private education loans in forbearance were 3.7 percent of private education loans in repayment and forbearance, up from 3.5 percent. Private education loan delinquencies as a percentage of private education loans in repayment were 2.4 percent, up from 2.1 percent.\nCore earnings for the fourth-quarter 2017 were $47 million, compared with $73 million in the year-ago quarter. Core earnings attributable to the company’s common stock were $44 million ($0.10 diluted earnings per share) in the fourth-quarter 2017, compared with $67 million ($0.15 diluted earnings per share) in the year-ago quarter. Absent the impact of the Tax Act, core earnings would have been $86 million, and core earnings attributable to the company’s common stock would have been $83 million ($0.19 diluted earnings per share) in the fourth-quarter 2017.\nCore earnings for 2017 were $294 million, compared with $252 million for 2016. Core earnings attributable to the company’s common stock were $278 million ($0.63 diluted earnings per share) for 2017, compared with $231 million ($0.53 diluted earnings per share) for 2016. Absent the impact of the Tax Act, core earnings would have been $333 million, and core earnings attributable to the company’s common stock would have been $317 million ($0.72 diluted earnings per share) for 2017.\nFourth-quarter 2017 and full-year 2017 GAAP results included $1 million and $8 million, respectively, of pre-tax losses from derivative accounting treatment that are excluded from core earnings results, vs. pre-tax losses of $4 million and $3 million, respectively, in the year-ago periods.\nSallie Mae provides core earnings because it is one of several measures used to evaluate management performance and allocate corporate resources. The difference between core earnings and GAAP net income is driven by mark-to-market unrealized gains and losses on derivative contracts recognized in GAAP net income, but not in core earnings results. Management believes its derivatives are effective economic hedges, and, as such, they are a critical element of the company’s interest rate risk management strategy.\nTotal Non-Interest Income and Expenses\nIn the fourth-quarter 2017, to reflect the application of the Tax Act’s lower rate in future years, the company reduced other income by $24 million due to a lower valuation of tax indemnification receivables. Unrelated to the Tax Act, the company also reduced other income by $9 million due to the expiration of a portion of indemnified uncertain tax positions. Tax expense was reduced by corresponding amounts for both of these items. Absent these two tax-related items, other income was $2 million lower than in the fourth-quarter 2016 primarily due to reduced credit card revenue from the company’s Upromise subsidiary.\nTotal non-interest expenses were $119 million in the fourth-quarter 2017, compared with $98 mi", "external_links": ["http://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.SallieMae.com%2Finvestors&esheet=51744879&newsitemid=20180117006482&lan=en-US&anchor=www.SallieMae.com%2Finvestors&index=1&md5=4b625545b8d681527677d2d046020eff", "http://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.salliemae.com&esheet=51744879&newsitemid=20180117006482&lan=en-US&anchor=SallieMae.com&index=3&md5=828e8c1fca3d8945d94fbb5e137841cf", "http://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.SallieMae.com%2Finvestors&esheet=51744879&newsitemid=20180117006482&lan=en-US&anchor=www.SallieMae.com%2Finvestors&index=2&md5=6e06dc650026a48625459f427128611c"], "published": "2018-01-18T00:43:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-18T03:31:07.002+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
