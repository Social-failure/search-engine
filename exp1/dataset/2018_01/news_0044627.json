(NYSE: CPF), (the \"Company\"), today reported net income in the fourth quarter of 2017 of $4.3 million, or diluted earnings per share (\"EPS\") of $0.14, compared to net income in the fourth quarter of 2016 of $12.2 million, or EPS of $0.39, and net income in the third quarter of 2017 of $11.8 million, or EPS of $0.39.\nNet income in the fourth quarter of 2017 included an estimated one-time, non-cash charge to income tax expense of $7.4 million, representing a ($0.25) decrease in EPS, due to the revaluation of the Company's net deferred tax assets resulting from the reduction in the corporate Federal income tax rate in connection with the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (\"Tax Reform\").\nNet income in the year ended December 31, 2017 totaled $41.2 million, or EPS of $1.34, compared to net income in the year ended December 31, 2016 of $47.0 million, or EPS of $1.50.\n\"We are pleased to have ended the year with strong loan and core deposit growth, as well as year-over-year increases in net interest income and net interest margin,\" said Catherine Ngo, President and Chief Executive Officer. \"While we recorded a one-time adjustment in the valuation of our net deferred tax assets in the quarter, we look forward to the positive impact of a reduced corporate income tax rate in the coming year.\"\nIn January 2018, the Company's Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.19 per share on its outstanding common shares. This represents a 5.6% increase from the $0.18 paid during the quarter. The dividend will be payable on March 15, 2018 to shareholders of record at the close of business on February 28, 2018.\nIn November 2017, the Company's Board of Directors authorized an increase in its common stock repurchase program authority by an additional $50 million. This amount is an addition to the $30 million in planned repurchases authorized earlier in the year. During the fourth quarter of 2017, the Company repurchased 167,000 shares of common stock at a total cost of $5.3 million, or an average cost per share of $31.47. During the year ended December 31, 2017, the Company repurchased 864,483 shares of common stock, or approximately 2.8% of its common stock outstanding as of December 31, 2016. Total cost of the shares repurchased during the year ended December 31, 2017 was $26.6 million, or an average cost per share of $30.72. The Company's remaining repurchase authority under its common stock repurchase program at December 31, 2017 is $53.5 million.\nEarnings Highlights\nNet interest income for the fourth quarter of 2017 was $42.8 million, compared to $39.7 million in the year-ago quarter and $42.0 million in the previous quarter. Net interest margin was 3.27%, increased from 3.22% in the year-ago quarter and increased from 3.25% in the previous quarter. The increases in net interest income and net interest margin from the year-ago and sequential quarters were primarily attributable to the growth in the loan and investment securities portfolios, combined with increases in yields earned on the loan and investment securities portfolios. These increases were partially offset by higher time deposits cost attributable to the recent increases in the federal funds rate.\nOther operating income for the fourth quarter of 2017 totaled $9.0 million, compared to $13.8 million in the year-ago quarter and $9.6 million in the previous quarter. The decrease from the year-ago quarter was primarily due to a $3.5 million gain on the sale of the Company's fee interest in a former branch location recorded in the year-ago quarter, combined with lower net gains on sales of residential mortgage loans of $1.1 million (included in mortgage banking income) recorded in the current quarter. The sequential quarter decrease was primarily due to lower commissions on sales of investment services and insurance of $0.5 million (included in other service charges and fees), combined with lower death benefit income of $0.4 million (included in income from bank-owned life insurance).\nOther operating expense for the fourth quarter of 2017 totaled $34.5 million, which decreased from $37.5 million in the year-ago quarter and increased from $33.5 million in the previous quarter. The decrease from the year-ago quarter was primarily due to lower salaries and employee benefits of $2.5 million, combined with a $0.7 million charge (included in other) related to the early termination of a lease recognized in the year-ago quarter. The decrease in salaries and employee benefits was primarily attributable to the recognition of $3.8 million in net actuarial losses recorded in the year-ago quarter related to the execution of a defined benefit pension plan de-risking strategy whereby the Company purchased non-participating annuity contracts to settle the pension obligation for a portion of its plan participants. This decrease was partially offset by $0.8 million in special, one-time bonuses given to all employees, with the exception of executives on its managing committee, in the fourth quarter of 2017. The sequential quarter increase was primarily due to higher salaries and employee benefits of $0.6 million, primarily attributable to the aforementioned bonuses, combined with higher advertising expense of $0.4 million and higher legal and professional expense of $0.2 million, partially offset by lower entertainment and promotions expense of $0.4 million (included in other). The higher entertainment and promotions expense recorded in the previous quarter was primarily attributable to a core deposit gathering campaign.\nThe efficiency ratio for the fourth quarter of 2017 was 66.54%, compared to 70.08% in the year-ago quarter and 64.99% in the previous quarter. The decrease in the efficiency ratio from the year-ago quarter was primarily due to the aforementioned $3.8 million in net actuarial losses and the $0.7 million charge related to the early termination of a lease recognized in the year-ago quarter, combined with the improvement in net interest income, partially offset by the aforementioned $3.5 million gain on the sale of the Company's fee interest in a former branch location recorded in the year-ago quarter. The increase in the efficiency ratio compared to the previous quarter was due to the aforementioned lower other operating income and higher other operating expenses, offset by the improvement in net interest income.\nIn the fourth quarter of 2017, the Company recorded income tax expense of $13.3 million, compared to $6.4 million in the year-ago quarter and $6.4 million in the previous quarter. The effective tax rate for the fourth quarter of 2017 was 75.6%, compared to 34.5% in the year-ago quarter and 35.0% in the previous quarter. The income tax expense and effective tax rate in the fourth quarter of 2017 were negatively impacted by the aforementioned estimated one-time, non-cash charge of $7.4 million related to Tax Reform.\nBalance Sheet Highlights\nTotal assets at December 31, 2017 of $5.62 billion increased by $239.5 million, or 4.4% from December 31, 2016, and increased by $54.5 million, or 1.0% from September 30, 2017.\nTotal loans and leases at December 31, 2017 of $3.77 billion increased by $245.7 million, or 7.0% and $134.2 million, or 3.7% from December 31, 2016 and September 30, 2017, respectively. The increase in total loans and leases from December 31, 2016 was primarily attributable to strong organic growth in the Hawaii loan portfolios, combined with increases in the U.S. mainland commercial mortgage and automobile portfolios, partially offset by reductions in the Hawaii construction and other consumer loan portfolios and the U.S. mainland commercial and other consumer loan portfolios. The increase in total loans and leases from the third quarter of 2017 was primarily due to strong organic growth in the Hawaii loan portfolios, combined with increases in the U.S. mainland commercial mortgage, automobiles, and commercial loan portfolios, partially offset by reductions in the Hawaii construction and the U.S. mainland other consumer loan portfolios.\nTotal deposits at December 31, 2017 of $4.96 billion increased by $348.2 million, or 7.6% from December 31, 2016, and increased by $28.9 million, or 0.6% from September 30, 2017. Core deposits, which include demand deposits, savings and money market deposits, and time deposits less than $100,000, totaled $3.99 billion at December 31, 2017. This represents an increase of $277.7 million, or 7.5% from December 31, 2016, and an increase of $35.9 million, or 0.9% from September 30, 2017.\nAsset Quality\nNonperforming assets at December 31, 2017 totaled $3.6 million, or 0.06% of total assets, compared to $9.2 million, or 0.17% of total assets at December 31, 2016, and $6.0 million, or 0.11% of total assets at September 30, 2017.\nLoans delinquent for 90 days or more still accruing interest totaled $0.6 million at December 31, 2017, compared to $1.4 million and $0.4 million at December 31, 2016 and September 30, 2017, respectively.\nNet charge-offs in the fourth quarter of 2017 totaled $1.0 million, compared to net charge-offs of $0.1 million in the year-ago quarter, and net charge-offs of $1.5 million in the previous quarter. Charge-offs remained relatively unchanged from the year-ago and previous quarters. The variances in net charge-offs from the year-ago and previous quarters were primarily due to the level of recoveries in each of the respective periods.\nIn the fourth quarter of 2017, the Company recorded a credit to the provision for loan and lease losses of $0.2 million, compared to a credit of $2.6 million in the year-ago quarter and a credit of $0.1 million in the previous quarter. The allowance for loan and lease losses, as a percentage of total loans and leases at December 31, 2017 was 1.33%, compared to 1.61% at December 31, 2016 and 1.41% at September 30, 2017.\nCapital\nTotal shareholders' equity was $500.0 million at December 31, 2017, compared to $504.7 million and $509.8 million at December 31, 2016 and September 30, 2017, respectively.\nThe Company maintained its strong capital position and its capital ratios continue to exceed the levels required to be considered a \"well-capitalized\" institution for regulatory purposes under Basel III. At December 31, 2017, the Company's leverage capital, tier 1 risk-based capital, total risk-based capital, and common equity tier 1 ratios were 10.4%, 14.7%, 15.9%, and 12.4%, respectively, compared to 10.6%, 15.1%, 16.3%, and 12.8%, respectively, at September 30, 2017.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nThis press release contains certain references to financial measures that have been adjusted to exclude certain expenses and other specified items. These financial measures differ from comparable measures calculated and presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (\"GAAP\") in that they exclude unusual or non-recurring charges, losses, credits or gains. This press release identifies the specific items excluded from the comparable GAAP financial measure in the calculation of each non-GAAP financial measure. Management believes that financial presentations excluding the impact of these items provide useful supplemental information that is important to a proper understanding of the Company's core business results by investors. These presentations should not be viewed as a substitute for results determined in accordance with GAAP, nor are they necessarily comparable to non-GAAP financial measures presented by other companies.\nConference Call\nThe Company's management will host a conference call today at 1:00 p.m. Eastern Time (8:00 a.m. Hawaii Time) to discuss the quarterly results.
