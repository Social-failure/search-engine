That risk was exacerbated by VW’s diesel emissions scandal.\nContinental has said software and electronics products are the biggest drivers of growth at the Hanover-based firm which also makes fuel-injection systems and transmission-control units. It plans to boost total sales to more than 50 billion euros by 2020.\nA possible separation of its so-called Powertrain business related to combustion engines is not on the agenda, CFO Schaefer said.\nInvestment banks have presented various ideas over the last couple of months, but no specific blueprint has emerged so far, a person familiar with the matter said.\n“We highlight the pent-up strategic optionality of any potential future spin-offs of individual business units which could unlock value,” London-based HSBC said in a Jan. 4 note, maintaining its “Buy” recommendation on Continental stock.\nShares in the group, which is 46 percent-controlled by the family that owns ball bearings maker Schaeffler ( SHA_p.DE ), jumped as much as 7.9 percent to a record high of 257.40 euros following the report, and closed 5.4 percent higher at 251.3 euros.\nContinental said a year ago it was reviewing its strategy for its Powertrain division after earnings at the business, whose products include transmission control units and fuel pumps, failed to meet expectations.\nBut it has also pledged to keep developing new products and systems for combustion-based power trains until at least 2025 when it expects demand for electric vehicles to start taking off on the back of continuing reductions in battery prices.\nBloomberg earlier reported Continental was in exploratory talks with advisers on a major overhaul or even a breakup of its business, citing people familiar with the matter.\nIt said Continental could create a holding company for its divisions and then list shares of the more profitable units, such as the tire business, or combine some operations with rivals.\n“As of today, it is wide open if and which changes could result from these early evaluations,” Continental said. “To date, there are no plans which could be submitted for approval.”\nReporting by Andreas Cremer and Jan Schwartz; Writing by Arno Schuetze and Maria Sheahan; Editing by Jane Merriman, Keith Weir, William Maclean\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-09T23:47:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-09T23:55:45.008+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
