Local governments are increasingly being held to account for their debt woes, with Beijing saying it will offer no bailouts.\nHebei Financing was unable to help pay back at least 32 billion yuan ($4.8 billion) in loans to creditors when borrowers started to default amid a slowing economy in 2015.\nSince Hebei Financing’s collapse, lenders have faced huge losses, and have repeatedly appealed to the provincial government to bail it out, sources involved in the situation told Reuters previously.\nIn their letter to Hebei’s provincial party secretary in December, trust companies said very little has changed since the debt crisis blew up three years ago.\nThe lenders said they have given the Hebei government “plenty of understanding, trust and tolerance”, but there has been no substantial progress in their 19 financing projects that ran into snags after Hebei Financing’s insolvency.\nFinancial institutions have been unable to use legal means to protect their rights as creditors, the letter stated.\nThe letter was also sent to the province’s National People’s Congress, high court, banking regulator, and other provincial government bodies, two sources with direct knowledge of the matter said.
