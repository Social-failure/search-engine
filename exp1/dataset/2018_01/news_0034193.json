October’s sales were revised slightly higher to 1.6 percent from the initially reported 1.5 percent.\nWholesale trade rose in six out of seven sectors in November, accounting for 99 percent of sales and led by a 1.9 percent increase in the food, beverage and tobacco industry.\nThe motor vehicle sector rose for the fourth time in five months, up 0.7 percent, on higher sales of new vehicle parts and accessories. Canadian auto sales topped the 2 million mark last year for the first time as consumers bought light trucks.\nInventories fell 1.2 percent, the first decline in eight months amid decreases in the machinery and equipment, and vehicle sectors.\nOverall, the report boded well for overall economic growth in November after a strong year that prompted the Bank of Canada to begin raising interest rates.\nReporting by Leah Schnurr Editing by Chizu Nomiyama\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-01-22T21:50:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-23T17:47:06.016+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
