The six banks have collectively been fined more than $2.8 billion. \nThe Justice Department said BNP Paribas will not be put on probation, given its “substantial” efforts to improve oversight and avoid a recurrence. \nIt also said the bank agreed to cooperate with the probe by the department’s antitrust division. \n“The division’s investigation aims to root out and eradicate the manipulation that has plagued this industry,” Assistant Attorney General Makan Delrahim said in a statement. \nBNP Paribas’ plea followed the Jan. 4, 2017 guilty plea of a former trader, Jason Katz, for conspiring to fix currency prices. \nKatz, who also worked at Barclays, was the first person to admit guilt in the probe, and is scheduled to be sentenced on July 5, court records show. \nFour other traders have also been criminally charged, and one of them has pleaded guilty, the Justice Department said. \nAnother French bank, Societe Generale ( SOGN.PA ), in November said it was in talks with U.S. authorities to resolve a probe into the alleged manipulation of benchmark interest rates such as the London Interbank Offered Rate, or Libor.
