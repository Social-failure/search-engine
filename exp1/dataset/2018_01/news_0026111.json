If he comes back in September that’s almost two years - that can’t happen. It’s not fair to everybody else,” White said.\n“I love Conor, respect Conor, love everything he’s done for the company, everybody knows that, I say it all the time (but) the belt would have to move on,” he explained.\nNeither White, the UFC nor McGregor’s representative have responded to a request for comment.\nReporting by Philip O'Connor; Editing by Christian Radnedge\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-17T19:10:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-17T19:27:24.023+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
