It all allows him to merge his ecological lifestyle with the restraints of urban space.\nFor Guy Elhadad, 26, his rooftop is his creative incubator, “where we can do whatever we want because we don’t need the approval of others”.\nHe and two roommates host yoga, music and art sessions there and built a spare sleeping place for people passing through. Elhadad said he loves Tel Aviv and through his rooftop can help make it bloom.\nReporting by Miriam Berger; Editing by Jeffrey Heller, William Maclean\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-01-15T20:55:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-15T15:10:42.012+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
