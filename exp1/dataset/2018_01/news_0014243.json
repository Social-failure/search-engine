That is comparable to the hot economy years before the 2007 to 2009 economic crisis. Shopping carts are seen outside a new Walmart Express store in Chicago July 26, 2011. REUTERS/John Gress \nThe Fed’s Beige Book research report in recent months has been filled with anecdotal stories, gathered by policymakers from the central bank’s 12 regional branches, of entrepreneurs struggling to fill positions and of wage pressures building. \nEven at 2.5 percent, current wage growth is “likely to be greater than inflation, which means households would continue to enjoy gains in purchasing power,” Bernard Baumohl, chief global economist with the Economic Outlook Group, wrote in a recent analysis. \nBut the Fed isn’t claiming victory yet. \nJob creation is expected to slow in coming months, as it inevitably does late in a recovery, with unemployment now well below the 4.6-percent level central bankers estimate the economy can sustain over the long run. \nYet, participation rates for prime-age workers remain around three percentage points below their late 1990s peak, translating into around 3 million 25- to 54-year-olds who could be employed or looking for jobs. \n“We still have many months, if not a year or two, to get as tight we like,” said Gould. \nThe Walmart announcement may also be a product of dynamics other than the demand and supply of labour. \nThe company said it was merely passing along to workers some of the savings it will get from a cut in the corporate tax rate. \nBut Target Corp ( TGT.N ), a main competitor, pushed its entry level wage to $11 last fall and has pledged to hit $15 by the end of 2020. \nIn addition, states have been steadily raising the legal minimum wage, with 14 now at $10-an-hour or more as of this year. \nCalifornia hit $11 on Jan. 1 and New York will move to $11.10 this summer. Wal-Mart employs around 130,000 people in the two states out of a U.S. workforce of 1.5 million, according to the company’s website.
