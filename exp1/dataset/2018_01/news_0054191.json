That compared with a 0.1 percent rise in the benchmark Hang Seng Index. \nThe China-focused developer posted strong first-half earnings growth in 2017 on robust residential sales, but it expects sales growth in the second half to taper off amid property curbs and a likely slowdown in mortgage lending.
