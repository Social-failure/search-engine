The 23-year-old won the DP World Tour Championship in November and Sunday’s victory was his second on the PGA Tour.\n”It’s hard to explain what this means right now,” Rahm told the Golf Channel. “I had a good feeling going into today. One of us had to do it and either one of us would’ve been a well deserved champion.”\nJan 21, 2018; La Quinta, CA, USA; Jon Rahm gives the forks up gesture for his alma mater Arizona State University while holding the trophy after the final round of the CareerBuilder Challenge golf tournament at PGA West TPC Stadium Course. Mandatory Credit: Joe Camporeale-USA TODAY Sports Rahm entered the tournament as the world’s number three but his victory pushes him past Jordan Spieth into second spot.\n“It’s hard to believe to be honest, passing Jordan Spieth,” he said. “That’s a three-time major champion. I only have two wins. He’s got 10-plus, right? It’s again – I’ve said it many times – I never thought I was going to be at this point in my life right now.”\nSlideshow (3 Images) Rahm started the final day two behind 54-hole leader Austin Cook and Landry was one behind.\nCook’s chances faded when he went three over after six holes.\nMartin Piller, John Huh and Adam Hadwin each finished at 20-under.\nWriting by Jahmal Corner in Los Angeles; Editing by Peter Rutherford\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-22T04:02:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-22T04:19:56.011+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
