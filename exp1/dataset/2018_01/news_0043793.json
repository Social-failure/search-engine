Land is an explosive political issue in Kenya.\nThe European Union (EU) shelved a $35 million water conservation scheme in the forest on Jan. 17 after Kenya Forest Service (KFS) guards killed a man belonging to the hunter-gatherer community, which opposes the aid project.\nThe EU and Amnesty International will visit the forest on Thursday, activists said.\nThe Sengwer petition, seen by the Thomson Reuters Foundation, said they went to court after hearing local media report on Jan. 19 that “the government would undertake air and ground operation to evict all persons in Embobut Forest”.\nPolice and county officials were not immediately available to comment. Environment minister, Judi Wakhungu, said last week that security forces were flushing criminals out of the forest.\nAlmost a dozen international rights groups called on Finland on Wednesday to suspend a 9.5 million euro ($12 million) project, working with KFS to support the forestry sector.\n“This is funding the ongoing human rights abuses by KFS that involve the burning of homes, forced evictions, and now their killing of a Sengwer community member,” the groups, including the UK-based Forest Peoples Programme, said in an open letter.\nThe Sengwer have fought for more than five decades for the right to live in the Embobut forest in the Cherengany Hills, from where they were first evicted by British colonialists in the 19th century.\n“It’s our call to the Finnish government to suspend this project just like the EU,” Sengwer activist Yator Kiptum said on Wednesday. “KFS just continued burning homes today.”\nDedan Ndiritu, KFS’s head of conservancy in the region, told the Thomson Reuters Foundation by phone on Wednesday, that the situation in Embobut forest was “normal” and “not much is happening there”.\n($1 = 0.8070 euros)\nReporting by Kevin Mwanza, Editing by Katy Migiro.
