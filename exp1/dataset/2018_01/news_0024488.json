The market is probably underestimating the ongoing positive environment for luxury goods,” he said.\nThe downturn had forced Richemont and peers like Swatch Group to clear excess inventory at retailers, offer cheaper products and open up to connected watches and online distribution.\nRichemont also replaced almost its entire management team, including most of its brand heads, and in November appointed insider Jerome Lambert to lead the group’s watch and fashion brands.\nEditing by Brenna Hughes Neghaiwi; Editing by Simon Cameron-Moore\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-01-11T14:49:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-12T18:30:13.008+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
