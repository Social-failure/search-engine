A detailed proposal will be presented before the end of March, he said.\nThe debate followed last week’s earthquake in the region, which prompted gas company NAM and the main regulator to call for a substantial production cut to limit seismic risks.\n“We need to get rid of gas in the long term and need to lower production now,” Wiebes said. “Financial consequences will play no role in my considerations.”\nThe government has lowered output from Groningen several times in recent years as decades of extraction have led to dozens of earthquakes each year, damaging thousands of homes and buildings.\nBut possibilities for further cuts are limited, as almost all Dutch households and many industrial companies depend on gas produced in Groningen.\nWiebes stressed the importance of switching large industrial users to other sources of energy and trying to revise export contracts for Groningen gas. “We won’t hesitate to switch off gas where possible, but the current dependency is not easy to solve,” he said.\nAfter a 10 percent cut to an annual rate of 21.6 billion cubic metres (bcm) of production for the year through October 2018, the Dutch government had pledged before last week’s earthquake that it would further reduce production to 20.1 bcm by 2020.\nReporting by Bart Meijer; Editing by Lisa Shumaker and Cynthia Osterman\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-01-17T07:13:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-17T19:52:38.038+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
