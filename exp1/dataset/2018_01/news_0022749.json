She most recently served as CMO at Tracx, a social media software company in Bethesda, MD. Prior to Tracx, she built the marketing and inside sales function from the ground up at Celerity where she was integral to driving its rapid growth, resulting in the successful sale of the company.\n“While technology innovation continues to speed ahead in every industry and for every role, enterprise web content management solutions have lagged behind,” said Kern. “Digital content editors, marketers, and publishers remain frustrated with the speed and ease at which they can manage their web presence in real-time, while taking advantage of the most current technology trends. Perfect Sense created Brightspot to solve that very problem and I couldn’t be more excited to be part of this product and customer-focused company.”\nIn her role at Perfect Sense, Kern will be responsible for developing sales and marketing strategies and implementing programs to drive scalable revenue growth through its digital content management platform, Brightspot, which will be launching a major upgrade in April, coinciding with the company’s ten-year anniversary .\n“What I saw at Perfect Sense was a different kind of company, one that was purpose-built to make people’s lives easier when it comes to managing their digital presence. The origin of the Brightspot name is rooted in our mission to be a consistent bright spot in the daily lives of web publishers, marketers, communicators, developers, and all of its users.”\nThe appointment of Kern comes one year after the company announced a $22M investment from Carrick Capital Partners. Her hire rounds out a series of strategic executive team hires, including that of CFO Kami Ragsdale earlier in 2017.\nKern is a frequent speaker and has served on several marketing association boards, including Women in Technology (WIT), Marketing Leaders of DC, and AMA-DC. She was recognized as Outstanding Female Speaker of the Year by HubSpot’s INBOUND conference for her presentation “Getting Sales Jazzed about Inbound Marketing.”\nAbout Perfect Sense\nFounded in 2008, Perfect Sense was created to deliver enterprise digital platform solutions in a more thoughtful way.
