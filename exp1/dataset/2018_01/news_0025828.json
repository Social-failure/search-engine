The crime sparked debate about foreign adoption in a nation where families are forced to give children up due to a lack of money to care for them.\nBut under international law, poverty should not be a grounds for international adoption, and efforts instead should be made in assisting families to stay together, say experts.\nThe revised law encourages local adoption, family reunification and reintegration to enable children to grow up within the country, said the state-run Ethiopian News Agency.\nAdoption experts emphasized that Ethiopia will need to follow-up the ban with increased efforts to assist vulnerable families within the country, and provide them with the resources to adequately care for their children.\n“The most important thing is for the children involved to have permanency, in families,” said Adam Pertman, president of the U.S.-based National Center on Adoption and Permanency and author of “Adoption Nation”.\n“The first choice is within their own family of origin, their own community and their own country,” he added.\nReporting by Nita Bhalla @nitabhalla, Editing by Ros Russell.
