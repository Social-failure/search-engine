I think this is still one of the things the Governing Council has to discuss,” he said.\nThe ECB confirmed last week that it will continue buying bonds at least until September and for as long as inflation is below its target. It also pledged to keep interest rates at their current, ultra-low levels for long after those purchases stop.\nInflation in the euro zone is comfortably above 1 percent but it is not expected to hit the ECB’s target for years to come.\n”Even if incoming data were to validate the expectation of a gradual build-up of inflationary pressures, this would not be sufficient to affirm a sustained adjustment, if even less supportive monetary policy conditions were to imperil the inflation trajectory, Praet said.\nYet the Dutch governor, Klaas Knot, said in an interview published at the weekend that he saw “no reason whatsoever to continue the program” and that President Mario Draghi was keeping his options open to curb a rise in the euro against the dollar.\nThe euro’s rise is damaging for inflation because it makes exports dearer and imports cheaper.\n($1 = 0.8051 euros)\nReporting by Francesco Canepa and Francesco Guarascio; Editing by Jeremy Gaunt\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-01-29T18:57:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-29T15:02:10.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
