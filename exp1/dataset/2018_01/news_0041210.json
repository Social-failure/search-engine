It coincided with Greece negotiating its third financial bailout from international creditors to stave off bankruptcy. \nTsipras, who came to power in early 2015, said he took the helm at a very difficult time for Greece which didn’t only have to grapple with its worst debt crisis and the refugee crisis, but also an “aggressive neighbor, sometimes unpredictable with an aggressive military activity in the Aegean,” Tsipras said.

REUTERS/Denis Balibouse \nNATO partners Greece and Turkey have a long history of differences that have outlived the Cold War, ranging from jousting over airspace in the Aegean Sea to minority rights and the ethnically split island of Cyprus. \nThe two now cooperate in a deal brokered between Ankara and the European Union in March 2016 aimed at slowing migrant flows. Tsipras described the deal, which has been criticized by human rights groups, as ‘a difficult but necessary agreement’.

But it’s not so easy for us.” Reporting By Michele Kambas and Renee Maltezou, Writing by Michele Kambas, Editing by William Maclean", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-24T17:21:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-24T17:54:54.034+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
