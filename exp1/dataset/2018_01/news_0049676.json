American Ryan Palmer was eliminated from the playoff at the first extra hole after failing to match the birdies carded by the other two.\nAustralian Day shot a closing 70, Noren of Sweden a 73, and Palmer carded a 72 as the trio finished at 10-under 278.\nOnly five extra holes were possible due to a slow final round, with the final threesome taking five hours and 55 minutes as whipping winds prompted plenty of indecision.\nJ.B. Holmes, who finished a stroke outside the playoff, took more than four minutes to play his second at the par-five 18th.\nDay said he was ready to go the distance on Monday in order to get his first win since the 2016 Players Championship.\n“I‘m just going to try to get some rest tonight and I’ll play all day tomorrow if I need to get the win,” he said.\n”This is something new for me to be able to go through a playoff and come back the next day.\nJan 28, 2018; San Diego, CA, USA; Alex Noren plays his shot from the fifth tee during the final round of the Farmers Insurance Open golf tournament at Torrey Pines Municipal Golf Course - South Co.
