I want to be playing against opponents that are former grand slam champions,” Russian Sharapova said. \n“She’s had success here. She’s had success playing out here in these conditions on these courts. I want to see where I am on that level.” \nTheir last three meetings have gone to three sets and Kerber is expecting another tight affair. \n”I‘m looking forward to playing against her,“ the German said. ”This is the matches I‘m looking forward to have, especially at the beginning of the year. \n“I had a lot in the last few weeks. I will try to continue my run and playing good like I played also here like the last two matches.” (Reporting by Nick Mulvenney in Sydney, editing by Amlan Chakraborty)", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-19T16:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-19T16:43:51.028+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
