IAG and Niki declined to comment.\nThe regional court for Berlin said on Monday a number of factors indicated that Niki’s focus was in Austria rather than in Germany, such as the fact that most of its workers had Austrian contracts, that its accounting was done in offices in Vienna and that it was operating under an Austrian license.\nIt said it would reverse a lower court’s Dec. 13 decision to allow insolvency proceedings in Germany, but said the ruling would only take effect after a one-month period during which Niki can appeal the decision in German federal court.\nFairplane said it did not believe a reversal of Niki’s insolvency filings in Germany would scupper the airline’s sale.\n”As soon as there is an insolvency process for Niki in Austria, the administrator there can approve the deal agreed with IAG/Vueling in Berlin and pursue its implementation, it said in a statement.\nIAG said it was “committed to working with all relevant parties to proceed with the purchase”.\nA court in Austria’s Korneuburg is reviewing an application for a new insolvency process for Niki there and said on Monday a decision would be made on Friday at the earliest.\nReporting by Maria Sheahan; Additional reporting by Alistair Smout and Kirsti Knolle; Editing by Alexander Smith and David Evans\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-01-09T00:33:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-09T09:40:32.543+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
