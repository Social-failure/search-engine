Its 2017 revenue is expected to grow to 1.2-1.25 billion euros ($1.5-$1.6 billion) from 1.88 billion in 2016. $1 = 0.8019 euros Reporting by Gilles Guillaume and Dominique Vidalon; Editing by Sudip Kar-Gupta", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-26T09:46:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-26T10:13:26.105+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
