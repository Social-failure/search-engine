More work stoppages were expected on Monday.\nThe bill pending parliament approval on Monday would restructure family benefits, introduce a new process for foreclosures on overdue loans, and make it harder to call a strike.\n“Hands off strikes!” protesters with Communist-affiliated group PAME chanted during a march of about 20,000 people, as lawmakers debated in parliament. Others held banners reading “Uprising!” and “No to modern slavery!”.\nThere were some clashes outside parliament when some protesters attempted to approach the building. They were pushed back by police who sprayed teargas, but the altercation was brief.\nProtesters from the communist-affiliated trade union PAME shout slogans during a demonstration against planned government reforms in Athens, Greece January 12, 2018. REUTERS/Alkis Konstantinidis The draft law has outraged many Greeks, who have seen living conditions and incomes plummet since the country first sought international aid to stave off bankruptcy in 2010, and required another two bailouts thereafter.\nIt is a bitter pill for ruling Syriza, the dominant party in the government elected in 2015, which has its roots in left-wing labor activism.\nAn elderly protester from the communist-affiliated trade union PAME takes part in a demonstration against planned government reforms in Athens, Greece January 12, 2018.

The new law would raise that to just over 50 percent, which creditors hope would limit the frequency of strikes and improve productivity that lags about 20 percent behind the European Union average.\nThe government says it needs the reforms to receive tranches of bailout aid. The latest bailout, worth up to 86 billion euros ($104 billion), expires in August. So far Greece has received 40.2 billion euros, and a new tranche is expected to be worth around 4.5 billion euros.
