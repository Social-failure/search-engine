He cited an audio recording obtained by its intelligence services.\n“Malong is a former chief of staff of the army but in accordance with the tape, he’s a rebel. The government and the security committee will come with an appropriate response,” he told a news conference.\nLucy Ayak, Malong’s wife, said the accusations were baseless.\n”This audio is a fake audio recording,“ she told Reuters by phone from Nairobi. ”Every time government is accusing him that he wants to launch an attack, which is not true.\nLast week, clashes broke out near Juba between government troops and rebels, the latest violation of a ceasefire signed in December.\nThe deal reached in the Ethiopian capital Addis Ababa between Kiir’s government and a myriad of opposition groups had aimed to end the four-year-old war in which tens of thousands of people have been killed.\nReporting by Denis Dumo in Juba; additional reporting by Jason Patinkin in Kampala; Writing by George Obulutsa; Editing by Angus MacSwan\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-01-08T22:49:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-09T09:40:41.651+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
