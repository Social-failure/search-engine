The Kurdish move prevented the fields from falling into the hands of the militants. \nKirkuk is one of the biggest and oldest oilfields in the Middle East, still estimated to contain about 9 billion barrels of recoverable oil, according to BP. \nBP has provided technical assistance in the past to the North Oil to aid the redevelopment of the Kirkuk field.
