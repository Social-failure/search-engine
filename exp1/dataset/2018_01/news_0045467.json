They say the recent abductions and alleged torture of social media bloggers and writers were part of a campaign to silence dissent.\nWriting by Asif Shahzad; Editing by Nick Macfie\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-01-24T19:55:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-25T12:56:39.023+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
