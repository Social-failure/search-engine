Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, presidential pre-candidate of the National Regeneration Movement (MORENA), waves as he leaves an event during which he unveiled his anti-corruption plan he will put in place if he wins this year's election, in Mexico City, Mexico January 29, 2018. REUTERS/Carlos Jasso \nLate last year, a group of opposition senators put forth a similar proposal. \nLopez Obrador is running a campaign based on fighting entrenched corruption and he has consolidated support, a poll showed Monday. However, the race has tightened as another opposition contender gained ground while the ruling party hopeful trailed.

He also put forward candidates to take over as top electoral crimes prosecutor and a newly created anti-corruption post.
