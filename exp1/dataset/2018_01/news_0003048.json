The market is clearly getting more bullish on oil as inventory levels get closer to the five-year average. Geopolitical uncertainty in Iran, OPEC's third largest producer, is also helping to support the price as citizens are again protesting the government,\" said by William O'Loughlin, investment analyst at Australia' Rivkin Securities.\nIran's elite Revolutionary Guards have deployed forces to three provinces to put down anti-government unrest that has been ongoing for a week, their commander said on Wednesday.\nIn the United States, crude oil inventories fell by 5 million barrels in the week to Dec. 29 to 427.8 million barrels, industry group the American Petroleum Institute said on Wednesday.\nPotentially undermining the trend towards tighter market conditions is U.S. oil production <C-OUT-T-EIA>, which has risen by almost 16 percent since mid-2016, hitting 9.75   (bpd) at the end of last year.\nOfficial   storage and production data is due on Thursday.
