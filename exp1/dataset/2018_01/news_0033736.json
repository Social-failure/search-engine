I was telling the last day it was always difficult to play for me here, so I‘m really, really happy.” \nBenneteau, ranked 59th in the world, was struggling with dehydration five games into the second set and eventually lost his cool as he bemoaned a lack of electrolyte drinks on Hisense Arena. \n“Where is my drink,” Benneteau asked. “I don’t care... I don’t play without my drink. It’s not my fault.” Tennis - Australian Open - Hisense Arena, Melbourne, Australia, January 20, 2018.
