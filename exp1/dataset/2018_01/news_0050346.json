That is not possible.” \nItaly’s EU affairs minister Sandro Gozi, often sympathetic to Britain, was blunter: “If you leave, you leave.” Bulgaria's Foreign Minister Ekaterina Zaharieva and French Minister attached to the Foreign Affairs Minister, Nathalie Loiseau attend a meeting of European Union Home/European affairs ministers in Brussels, Belgium January 29, 2018. REUTERS/Francois Lenoir \nEU diplomats also dismissed the idea of Britain having a veto over EU laws after it leaves on March 29 next year, although the transition offer does give London a chance to air its views in EU meetings where its interests are at stake -- and notably on issues of immediate economic impact, such as EU fishing quotas. \nThe pace of EU legislation is slow enough that little which might be decided in the 21 months could be forced on Britain before it had fully left the system on Dec. 31, 2020.

REUTERS/Francois Lenoir \nBy that time, both sides hope to be able to enact a free trade accord to keep goods and services flowing, albeit leaving Britain outside the EU single market and customs union. \nBarnier said this timetable was still subject to May and her ministers agreeing a plan among themselves and presenting it to Brussels -- and also depends on finalising many issues on the divorce treaty. \nWhile Britain agreed to pay tens of billions of euros into EU coffers on leaving and to give lifetime rights to Europeans living there, many issues have yet to be settled, including the power of the EU courts over the treaty and how the EU-UK border across the island of Ireland will be kept “invisible”.

An outline trade package could then be agreed by the time the divorce and transition deal is ready in October. \nShowing some willingness to be flexible, the EU ministers are open to extending the transition period if need be to reach a trade pact -- though Barnier warned it could not be very long -- and also voiced a will to endorse Britain concluding trade agreements with other countries before the transition ends.
