Iranian forces, Hezbollah and other Shi‘ite Muslim militias also back Assad. \nIsrael fears Iran could be left with a permanent garrison in Syria, extending a threat posed from neighbouring Lebanon by Hezbollah, which has an extensive missile arsenal and last fought a war with the Israeli military in 2006. \nNetanyahu said he also planned to discuss with Putin “Iran’s effort to turn Lebanon into one giant missile site, a site for precision missiles against the State of Israel, which we will not tolerate”.
