Morgan, Lloyds Bank and Santander GBM to act as joint bookrunners for the sale of several billion pounds of a 30-year index-linked bond.\nThe DMO said the syndication of the 2048 index-linked gilt, which carries a 0.125 percent coupon, would take place in the week starting Feb. 5, subject to market conditions.\nBritish government bond syndications typically take place on the Tuesday of a given week.\nThe launch of the gilt on Nov. 7 attracted 23.7 billion pounds ($32.85 billion) of orders from investors and led to the sale of 3 billion pounds of the gilt at a real yield of -1.541 percent, the lowest of any gilt sold via syndication.\nThe gilt now trades at a real yield of -1.554 percent.\nSo far this year the DMO has raised 19.865 billion pounds of finance through bond syndications, and would need to raise a further 3.835 billion pounds to meet its target for the year to the end of March.\nIf there is strong demand for the gilt, a further 1 billion pounds of 2017/18 issuance remains unallocated.
