In a possible sign of division within the opposition alliance, Odinga’s vice presidential candidate and two other senior leaders were absent.\nOdinga said the vice president would be sworn in at a later date.\nThe attorney-general had warned that Odinga could be charged with treason if the event went ahead - an offense that can carry the death penalty.\nAs people assembled, authorities forced independent television and radio stations reporting on the gathering off air, several outlets said - the most widespread censorship for a decade.\n“We have an illegitimate government,” Odinga told a local broadcaster by phone in an interview that was streamed online before the event. “Whenever there is a crisis, there is also an opportunity. This is an opportunity to bring the country together.”\nA supporter of Kenyan opposition leader Raila Odinga of the National Super Alliance (NASA) coalition jumps from a bus after riot police fired teargas canisters to disperse them after his swearing-in ceremony in Nairobi, Kenya January 30, 2018. REUTERS/Isaac Biosse Odinga refused to be drawn on his plans for after his symbolic inauguration, repeatedly telling the interviewer, “Hold your horses” and “We’ll see”.\nMany of the protesters chanted pro-Odinga slogans, waved tree branches and blew horns and whistles. Afterwards several said they could not hear Odinga’s brief address.\n“I‘m happy this has happened but we are waiting for the next step forward but we don’t know what it is,” said nurse Grace Waithera. “I‘m very fed up with this ... government. If we can remove them we will.”\nMany of those at the rally had come from the capital’s slums. Odinga has strong support there and in the west and along the coast, areas where people have long felt ignored by central government and shut out of political patronage networks.\nSlideshow (14 Images) “PREVENTABLE CRISIS”\n“This is a lose-lose situation for both Kenyatta and Odinga and it was an entirely preventable crisis. It’s not clear where Odinga goes next from here,” said Murithi Mutiga, a senior analyst for the International Crisis Group.\n“Kenyatta as well - by resisting all attempts at dialogue, he has put himself in a position where he will continue to struggle to be seen as the president of all Kenyans.”\nAlthough the police had said they would prevent any illegal assembly, there were no uniformed police in the park and no anti-riot officers or vehicles were visible.\nNearly 100 people were killed over the prolonged election period, mostly in clashes between Odinga supporters and police.\nBy 10:20 a.m. (0720 GMT), a number of independently owned media outlets including Citizen radio and television, NTV and KTN said that authorities had forced them off air.\nA Communications Authority spokeswoman said it would comment later.\nOn Monday, Linus Kaikai, chairman of the Kenya Editors’ Guild, said editors had been warned by authorities that they could be shut down if they covered the event.\nAdditional reporting by Humphrey Malalo and Katharine Houreld; Writing by Katharine Houreld; Editing by Matthew Mpoke Bigg\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-30T09:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-30T09:19:02.002+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
