REUTERS/Peter Nicholls/File Photo \nAssange, who denies the allegations, believes Sweden would hand him over to the United States to face prosecution over WikiLeaks’ publication of thousands of classified military and diplomatic documents in one of the largest information leaks in U.S. history. \n“There are well-founded fears we have about possible risks to his life and integrity, not necessarily by the UK but by third party states,” Espinosa said. \nShe did not give details on how granting Assange citizenship might help him leave the embassy and avoid arrest. \nEcuador’s left-wing president Lenin Moreno, who took office in May, has been less friendly toward Assange than his predecessor Rafael Correa.

U.S. intelligence agencies believe Russian military intelligence used WikiLeaks and other sites to release the emails it hacked from the Democratic National Committee and top Democrats. Assange said he does not know the source of the emails. \nAssange faces both criminal and congressional investigations in the United States. \nThere is no evidence at this point that U.S. authorities have filed any charges against him, including secret charges, but CIA Director Mike Pompeo last year called WikiLeaks a “hostile intelligence service.” \nU.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions, responding to a reporter’s question in April about whether arresting Assange was a priority, said it was. \n“Whenever a case can be made, we will seek to put some people in jail,” Sessions said at a press briefing.
