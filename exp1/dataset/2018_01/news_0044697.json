But we need low barriers to trade for all of this to work,” said Mariann Montagne, senior investment analyst and portfolio manager at Gradient Investments.\nShares of Whirlpool rose 2.6 percent and solar companies such as Real Goods Solar, Sunworks and First Solar climbed following the new tariffs.\nAt 10:54 a.m. ET (1554 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 7.83 points, or 0.03 percent, at 26,222.43 and the S&P 500 was up 5.8 points, or 0.20 percent, at 2,838.77.\nThe Nasdaq Composite was up 41.87 points, or 0.57 percent, at 7,449.90.\nVerizon was up marginally following a quarterly revenue that beat estimates.\nJohnson & Johnson fell 2.2 percent after a U.S. appeals court upheld a ruling that invalidated a crucial patent on its blockbuster rheumatoid arthritis drug Remicade, limiting its ability to seek damages from Pfizer over its launch of a lower-cost version of the drug.\nProcter & Gamble dropped about 3 percent as investors focused on a drop in gross margins at the world’s largest consumer goods maker.\nAdvancing issues outnumbered decliners on the NYSE by 1,399 to 1,359. On the Nasdaq, 1,507 issues fell and 1,248 advanced.
