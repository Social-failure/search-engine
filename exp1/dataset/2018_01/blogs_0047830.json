As Cramer watched the ticker tape while he was on live TV, he couldn't believe what he was seeing. It looked like people were selling for no reason other than to sell.\n\"I urged viewers right there on the set to pick a stock they loved and buy it using limit orders, so you wouldn't have to accept a price you didn't like,\" Cramer said.\n\"The result? To this day, people still come up to me and thank me for that advice during the flash crash,\" he added. \"But I simply put my rule into practice, realizing that nobody ever made a dime panicking and then I tried to help you profit from it.\"\n'Ignore emotions' Keeping an even keel and planning sell-off strategies ahead of time can help investors buck the panic and make smart choices when stocks are on sale.\nAnd while Cramer's not saying that investors should buy every stock on their most wanted list every single time there's a sell-off, there is value in occasionally swimming upstream.\n\"The next time there's a big, market-wide sell-off and you feel like fleeing and never touching a stock again, I want you to do something for me. I want you to take the opposite side of your emotions, the opposite side of the trade,\" Cramer said. \"Take a deep breath and wait for the rebound before you sell.\"\nAnother cardinal rule is to stick to your essential stocks when the market endures big declines.\n\"When the stock market gets unrelentingly negative, remember that he who defends everything defends nothing,\" Cramer said. \"What exactly does that mean? It's about how you evaluate your holdings.\"\nInvestors can't possibly hang on to every stock they own during a big decline, Cramer said. Some stocks just won't fit the new environment and will hurt you if you don't sell.\nIf you treat every single decline as a buying opportunity, you'll quickly waste all your cash building positions, and end up unprepared for future declines.\nThe solution? Get selective, the \"Mad Money\" host said. Pick the best stocks to buy into weakness and sell the rest to raise cash.\n\"Great investors know how to ignore their emotions when those emotions get in the way of making money. So the next time the market gets slammed, don't panic — nobody every made a dime by panicking — but also don't double down just with your eyes closed on the whole portfolio into weakness,\" Cramer concluded.\n\"Vicious, negative markets can give you buying opportunities, but you need to focus your capital on your absolute favorites rather than chasing bargains in lower quality merchandise when it turns out they weren't bargains at all.\"\nWATCH: Cramer's tried-and-true strategy for navigating market panic show chapters Cramer: I helped investors through the 2010 flash crash by following one key rule 18 Hours Ago | 09:09 ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-26T01:45:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-26T02:11:11.006+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
