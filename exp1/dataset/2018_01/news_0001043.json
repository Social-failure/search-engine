REUTERS/Thierry Gouegnon \nMore than 60 percent of Liberians depend on agriculture for their livelihood and multinationals like Malaysia-based Sime Darby have invested heavily in palm oil plantations. But the sector has languished due to low productivity, forcing Liberia to import more than 80 percent of its staple foods. \nWeah has also made repairing Liberia’s hollowed-out infrastructure a priority. He grew up in Monrovia’s Clara Town slum and can look out on the derelict lots and gutted streets from the upstairs balcony where he spoke to Reuters. \n“The roads for connectivity are vital. We have partners and we have revenue that we will make sure will come in to build our roads,” he said. \nWeah, who starred for top European clubs such as AC Milan and Paris Saint Germain in the 1990s, has parlayed his rags-to-riches biography into political success but faces criticism that he lacks the experience and knowledge for the job. \nHe has in turn promised to surround himself with first-rate advisers and appealed to Liberians living overseas to return home. \n“We will have economists who will put us on track. They will look at what is in the coffers and then work out how to move forward,” he said. \nIn the days since he became president-elect, security guards in sharp suits and ties have appeared outside the house and a new watch tower rises above 10-foot walls reinforced with barbed wire. \nBut Weah insisted that his new-found status would not go to his head. \n“I don’t want my title to define my character,” he said as he walked the property, exchanging jokes with the staff. “I don’t think as a president I will change.” Writing by Aaron Ross, Editing by William Maclean", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-02T19:14:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-02T19:28:59.011+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
