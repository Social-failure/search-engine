The oil spill from a stricken Iranian tanker Sanchi that sank on Sunday is seen in the East China Sea, on January 16, 2018 in this photo provided by Japan’s 10th Regional Coast Guard. 10th Regional Coast Guard Headquarters/Handout via REUTERS \nSatellite imaging showed a slick of 69 square kms (26.6 square miles) and a second 40 square km (15.4 square mile) slick, which is less thick and not as concentrated, the State Oceanic Administration (SOA) said in a statement. \nThe large tanker Sanchi (IMO:9356608) sank in the worst oil ship disaster in decades on Sunday, raising worries about damage to the marine ecosystem. \nThe vessel’s crew of 30 Iranians and two Bangladeshis are all believed to have perished in the incident. \nThe SOA said vessels have taken 31 water samples in the area around the wreck containing black grease with heavy oil smells, and a concentration of petroleum that exceeds some seawater quality standard limits. \nThe news comes as clean-up teams continue to monitor the wreck area to assess the distribution and drift of the oil spill and the ecological impact. \nThe tanker had been adrift and ablaze after crashing into the freighter CF Crystal (IMO:9497050) on Jan. 6. Strong winds pushed it away from the Chinese coast, where the incident happened, and into Japan’s exclusive economic zone (EEZ). \nThe ship, which was carrying 136,000 tonnes or almost a million barrels of condensate - an ultra-light, highly flammable crude oil - sank after several explosions weakened the hull. \nOn Tuesday, Japan’s environment ministry said it doesn’t see much chance that the spill will reach its shores.
