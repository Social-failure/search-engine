We are a united family.” \nSpartak Moscow have been fined on several occasions for their fans’ racist behaviour. \nEuropean soccer’s governing body UEFA opened disciplinary proceedings against Spartak youth player Leonid Mironov last month after he allegedly racially abused Liverpool’s Rhian Brewster. \nThe World Cup will be held from June 14 to July 15 across 12 venues in 11 cities including Moscow, St Petersburg and Sochi.
