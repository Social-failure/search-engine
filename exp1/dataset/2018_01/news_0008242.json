It had agreed to comply by Dec. 6.\nMoscow imposed a ban on most Western food imports in August 2014 in retaliation against Western sanctions over its actions in Ukraine. It imposed the pig and pork ban after a few cases of African swine fever in some parts of the EU that year.\nReporting by Jack Stubbs; Editing by Edmund Blair\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-01-08T18:33:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-08T13:57:15.013+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
