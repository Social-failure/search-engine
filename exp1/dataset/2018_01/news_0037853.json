Five-year Greek bond yields were down about 3 bps at 2.81 percent, while longer dated bond yields were slightly higher on the day.\n“Certainly Greece has made a great deal of progress recently and risks are far lower,” said Jennifer McKeown, chief European economist at Capital Economics. “Given how much its debt costs have been pushed down, a ratings upgrade probably makes sense.” (Reporting by Dhara Ranasinghe; Editing by Abhinav Ramnarayan)\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-01-22T18:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-23T17:55:28.003+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
