REUTERS/Shannon Stapleton On Thursday, CVS shares rose as much as 4 percent after it said cash flows would get a $1.2 billion boost from the new U.S. tax code that would see corporate tax rates slashed to 21 percent from 35 percent.\nPROFIT HIT BY CHARGE Net income attributable to Walgreens fell to $821 million, or 81 cents per share, in the first quarter ended Nov.30, from $1.05 billion, or 97 cents per share, a year earlier.\nAn impairment charge related to its investment in Chinese wholesale partner Guangzhou Pharmaceuticals [GZPHA.UL] hurt profits, the company said.\nOn an adjusted basis, the drugstore chain earned $1.28 per share, beating the analysts’ average estimate of $1.26 per share.\nNet sales rose 7.9 pct to $30.74 billion.\nAnalysts on average were expecting a revenue of $30.35 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.\nThe drugstore chain also lifted the lower end of its full-year adjusted profit forecast by 5 cents to a range of $5.45-$5.70 per share. Analysts on average were expecting $5.56 per share.\nReporting by Siddharth Cavale and Ankit Ajmera Arun Koyyur\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-04T14:23:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-04T14:34:49.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
