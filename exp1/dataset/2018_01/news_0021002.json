It previously reported a similar death in January 2016.\nFord said both Takata deaths occurred with inflators built on the same day. At least 21 deaths worldwide are believed linked to the Takata inflators that can rupture and send deadly metal fragments that has led to the largest automotive recall in history. All of the other deaths have occurred in Honda Motor Co vehicles.
