(NYSE AMER:NSPR), a leader in embolic prevention systems (EPS) / thrombus management technologies and neurovascular devices, today announced the publication of an independent observational study conducted by Tomoyuki Umemoto, MD and colleagues in the December 2017 issue of the journal EuroIntervention demonstrating the advantage of CGuard™ EPS in reducing stent plaque prolapse (vascular tissue or thrombus protruding through the stent and into the carotid artery following stenting that is vulnerable to embolizing into the brain) in carotid artery stenting patients.\nThe aim of this study was to compare plaque prolapse after carotid artery stenting (CAS) with CGuard™ versus a competing device as assessed by optical coherence tomography (OCT), a technique that performs high definition images inside of the artery. A series of sixteen consecutive patients undergoing CAS were enrolled in the study. A total of 248 cross-sectional OCT images (166 images for CGuard™ and 82 for the competing device) were analyzed to assess the incidence of plaque prolapse.\nAs introduction to this OCT study, an editorial appeared in the same EuroIntervention issue, authored by Professor Piotr Musialek, Jagiellonian University Department of Cardiac & Vascular Diseases, John Paul II Hospital, Krakow, Poland, and Prof Eugenio Stabile, Division of Cardiology, Department of Advanced Biomedical Sciences, University of Naples “Federico II”, Naples, Italy. The editorial authors state: “With conventional carotid stenting, plaque prolapse occurs via the ‘cheese-grater’ effect.” They go on to highlight the permanent protective role of CGuard™ EPS, the unique MicroNet™ covered carotid stent, which already demonstrated neuro-protection in the CARENET Study. The editorial authors noted that the competing device had a two-fold greater risk of plaque prolapse compared with CGuard™ in the OCT frames analysis.\nJames Barry, PhD, Chief Executive Officer of InspireMD, commented, “We are pleased to see another study conducted on CGuard™ EPS that was again, focused on proving out the mechanism of the protective properties of MicroNet™ in the treatment of carotid artery disease. While this observational study was conducted on a limited number of patients, it was encouraging to see that CGuard™ EPS continues to perform as advertised in the clinical setting. Moreover, the fact that yet another independent clinical investigation was conducted and the investigators saw it fit to once again publish further validates the interest in CGuard™ EPS and the future the device holds for potentially preventing catastrophic events that can occur with conventional carotid artery stents.”\nEuroIntervention is a monthly peer-reviewed journal of interventional cardiovascular medicine that has become one of the benchmarks in its field. EuroIntervention is the official journal of EuroPCR and the European Association of Percutaneous Cardiovascular Interventions (EAPCI). The Journal is endorsed by the European Society of Cardiology (ESC) and has a distinguished European and International editorial board led by Prof Patrick W. Serruys from the Erasmus MC, Rotterdam.\nThe Company also announced that it has received notice from the NYSE American LLC (the \"NYSE American\") pursuant to Section 1003(f)(v) of the NYSE American's Company Guide that, due to the Company's current low selling share price, the Company's continued listing on the NYSE American is contingent upon the Company effecting a share consolidation or otherwise demonstrating a sustained improvement in its share price within the next six months but not longer than July 16, 2018 (or such longer period as may be agreed to by the NYSE American).\nAbout InspireMD, Inc.\nInspireMD seeks to utilize its proprietary MicroNet™ technology to make its products the industry standard for embolic protection and to provide a superior solution to the key clinical issues of current stenting in patients with a high risk of distal embolization, no reflow and major adverse cardiac events.\nInspireMD intends to pursue applications of this MicroNet technology in coronary, carotid (CGuard™), neurovascular, and peripheral artery procedures.
