REUTERS/Hazir Reka German and French envoys lobbied Kosovo leaders in Pristina last week not to abolish the Specialist Chamber set up in 2015 to try ex-Kosovo Liberation Army (KLA) guerrillas for alleged atrocities in the war that led to independence from Serbia. \nProponents of doing away with the court say it is mandated only to prosecute ethnic Albanians and that it would duplicate the work of other courts dealing with war crimes during the 1990s break-up of old Yugoslavia. \nPrime Minister Ramush Haradinaj, President Hashim Thaci and parliamentary speaker Kadri Veseli are former KLA commanders and could potentially be indicted by the court or called as witnesses, some Kosovo Albanian media reported. \n“Kosovo needs to be willing to close this chapter of history even if it means holding some of its wartime leaders to account,” Delawie told reporters. \nA 2011 report for the Council of Europe linked leading Kosovo figures – notably Thaci – to gruesome crimes against Serbs, including trade in organs harvested from prisoners of war. Thaci has denied any wrongdoing. \nThe court, based abroad in The Hague to minimise the risk of witness intimidation and judicial corruption, has yet to hear any cases. \nThe United States is Kosovo’s staunchest ally but Pristina also hopes for eventual association with the EU. To that end, the EU has told Pristina it must first root out rampant corruption and organized crime, prosecute war crimes and normalize relations with its neighbors including Serbia. \nReporting by Fatos Bytyci; writing by Aleksandar Vasovic; editing by Ivana Sekularac and Mark Heinrich\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-17T17:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-17T17:15:17.014+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
