It restarted the smelter Nov. 17.\n“It’s business as usual,” said spokesman Kyle Bennett.\nIn the fourth quarter, refined copper production at Kennecott declined 67 percent compared with the same period in the previous year, to 22,100 tonnes from 67,000 tonnes, Rio said in an operations report last week.\nThe smelter was expected to draw down an increased concentrate inventory during the first half of 2018, Rio said.\nIn 2017, Kennecott produced 125,800 tonnes of refined copper, down some 20 percent from 2016.\nReporting by Susan Taylor; Editing by Marguerita Choy\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-01-27T00:23:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-27T00:06:54.008+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
