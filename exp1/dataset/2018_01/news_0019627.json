Set new career goals It's so important to be proactive in your career goal-setting — it's not your manager's responsibility, but your responsibility. You control your career brand, so it's worth personally documenting your goals in an Individual Development Plan (IDP) at the start of 2018, even if your employer doesn't require it. When I relaunched my information technology career into the private sector, I created new career goals that were going to make me a happier professional.\nFor instance, I set new training goals, established work-life balance boundaries and decided I only wanted to commute 25 miles from home to work. And within nine months of leaving my federal government job, I earned my ScrumMaster certification. This certification helped me earn over $40,000 more than my former salary.\n3.

Then, I joined professional groups and invited industry professionals to be a part of my online network.\nIt's important to connect with recruiters and senior executives at the companies where your desire to work in 2018 — feel free to send them a direct message and introduce yourself. Most of my direct messages landed me interviews at companies like Deloitte, Microsoft, Amazon and Booz Allen Hamilton.\nDon't forget to have fun relaunching your career in 2018.
