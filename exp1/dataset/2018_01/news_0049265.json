Sidibe followed with a basket inside, and Syracuse held on to win its third straight game and keep Pittsburgh winless in ACC play.\nSidibe finished with a career-high 18 points and 16 rebounds for the Orange (15-6, 4-4 ACC), who won at Pittsburgh for only the second time in their last 10 trips.\nMarcus Carr had 16 points and 12 assists and Jared Wilson-Frame finished with 18 points and 13 rebounds for the Panthers (8-14, 0-9), who have lost nine in a row.\nIn a battle of the two worst shooting teams in the ACC, the first half was a low-scoring grind that featured multiple droughts. The teams went four minutes without a field goal during one stretch. Pittsburgh didn’t have a basket for nearly nine minutes but was tied 17-17 with four minutes left in the half.\nNeither team shot 30 percent from the field in the first half. One errant Syracuse 3-pointer ended up wedged between the rim and the backboard. It wasn’t pretty, but it was competitive.\nSyracuse led 22-20 at halftime. Wilson-Frame had 13 of Pittsburgh’s points in the first half.\nThe offense picked up in the second half, and the game stayed tight. Parker Stewart and Carr hit 3-pointers to answer a quick start by Syracuse.\nThe Orange blocked 11 Pittsburgh shots, including three by Sidibe, who didn’t even see the floor three games ago, but came up big against the Panthers.\nPittsburgh shot 27.7 percent from the floor. The Panthers have not won since a Dec. 22 victory over Townson.\nThe Orange travel to Georgia Tech on Wednesday.\nPittsburgh will look to pick up its first conference win at Miami on Wednesday.\n--Field Level Media\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-01-28T07:31:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-29T11:48:43.011+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
