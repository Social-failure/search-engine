Tell me where is our lies and I’ll tell you where are yours.”\nDuterte ridiculed Rappler’s argument that the SEC decision was harassment, and suggested it was hypocritical for finding fault with his government while having broken the law itself.\n“Look, why should you complain if I am critical against media? Are you not critical of me?”\nRappler is the latest entity to have taken on Duterte and found itself subjected to various forms of scrutiny initiated by his political allies, usually after his public outbursts against those who have dared to challenged him.\nHis government has denied that his supporters are doing his bidding for him, including followers who have launched scathing online attacks on critics and journalists.\nDuterte himself has previously voiced disagreement with some action against his opponents, although he has stopped short of intervening to stop it.\n‘ALARMING ATTEMPT’\nForeign press organisations and human rights groups have rallied behind Rappler, joining a chorus of domestic outrage among the media and political opposition at what they saw as move to muzzle those scrutinizing Duterte.\nAmnesty International called it “an alarming attempt to silence independent journalism”, describing Rappler as “fearless in holding those in power to account”.\nHuman Rights Watch said the foreign ownership allegations “masked a vendetta” against Rappler and the decision “suggests a sinister use of state regulatory processes to stifle critical media voices”.\nDuring last year’s annual address to the nation, Duterte singled out Rappler for being fully owned by Americans, which Rappler refutes.\nThe two U.S.-based organisations that have invested in Rappler are Omidyar Network, created by eBay founder and entrepreneur Pierre Omidyar, and North Base Media, which advocates independent media.\nRappler said its filings to the SEC in 2015 made it clear that just like several other media outlets, foreigners had invested in some of its Philippine Depositary Receipts (PDR), but did not own any shares, or have a say in operations.\nPresidential spokesman Harry Roque said earlier on Tuesday that by selling PDR to those entities, Rappler had given foreigners “the power to negatively control the company” without them holding any of its shares.\n“Rappler in effect becomes a dummy of the foreign investor,” he told news channel ANC.\nRoque denied that it was Solicitor General Jose Calida, a close associate of Duterte, who had initiated the case against Rappler and said the regulator was already looking into its ownership before Calida took it up.\nSEC Commission Secretary Armando Pan, however, said the case started with Calida’s complaint.\nRappler’s investigative reporting has included allegations that Duterte’s government has “weaponized” social media, using it to discredit and generate online hate against his most vocal detractors. His office rejects that.\nRappler chief executive Maria Ressa disputed Roque’s remarks and said a “war of attrition” was now underway.\nDuterte also hit out anew at the former owners of the Philippine Daily Inquirer, another media outlet known for scrutinising his government, accusing them of being oligarchs who evaded tax. Neither the newspaper nor its former owners have responded to Duterte’s allegations.\n“In this country the issue is not press freedom, the issue is abuse of the elite and those in power,” Duterte said.
