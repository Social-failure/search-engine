Stone has not yet hired advisers.\nThe company, controlled by founders André Street and Eduardo Pontes, has among its minority shareholders British buyout firm Actis LLP and Brazilian investment firm Gavea Investimentos Ltda.\nOther shareholders include 3G Capital Inc founders Jorge Paulo Lemann, Marcel Telles and Carlos Alberto Sicupira, as well as Madrone Capital Partners, a U.S.-based investment firm that manages part of the fortune of the Walton family, the majority owners of Wal-Mart Stores Inc ( WMT.N ).\nIn a statement, Stone said there was “no ongoing share offering.” Actis declined to comment. Gavea and Madrone did not immediately comment.\nRACE TO GROW Stone would be the second Brazilian card processing company to go public this year, as industry competition increases during a nascent economic recovery after the country’s harshest recession in decades.\nPagSeguro Internet Ltda filed for an IPO last month, with underwriters Goldman Sachs & Co ( GS.N ), Morgan Stanley ( MS.N ), Credit Suisse Group AG ( CSGN.S ), Deutsche Bank Securities ( DBKGn.DE ) and Bank of America Merrill Lynch ( BAC.N ).\nPagSeguro, owned by Brazilian media group Universo Online SA, plans to raise at least $1.6 billion. The IPO will price next week, with trading to begin on Wednesday on the New York Stock Exchange.\nStone shareholders are waiting to confirm the valuation of PagSeguro’s IPO before proceeding with the plans for their own offering, the sources added.\nAccording to the sources, Stone has 4.5 percent of Brazil’s payment market, where a dozen credit card processors are competing for a share of robust growth.\nIn 2015, only 32 percent of Brazilians above age 15 had a credit card, compared with 60 percent in the United States, according to the World Bank.\n($1 = 3.21 reais)\nAdditional reporting by Tatiana Bautzer; Editing by Lisa Von Ahn\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-01-19T15:03:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-19T12:06:36.030+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
