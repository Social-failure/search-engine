Duterte has lauded Japan for its “preeminent and peerless role” as a big investor and development partner.\nA spokeswoman from Japan’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs said it was “extremely regrettable” that comfort women statues including the one in the Philippines had been erected.\nLast year, Japan temporarily recalled its ambassador to South Korea over a statue commemorating Korean women forced to work in Japanese military brothels during World War Two.\nSouth Korean activists estimate that there may have been as many as 200,000 Korean victims.\nA Philippine women’s group called Gabriela said Japan aimed “to erase any trace of their country’s brutality to the world and we should not allow them to have their way on historical revisionism”.\n“It is an added insult to the comfort women in the country and the families of those who died during the Japanese occupation if this administration allows Japan to have the say in the comfort women monument issue,” it said in a statement.\nReporting by Enrico dela Cruz; Additional reporting by Timothy Kelly in TOKYO; Editing by Martin Petty, Robert Birsel\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-11T13:47:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-11T14:12:42.002+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
