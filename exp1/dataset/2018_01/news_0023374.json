This brought its year-over-year gain to 1.8 percent.\nFederal Reserve policy-makers would like to see core inflation to strengthen to 2 percent.\nAt the same time, the government reported retail sales rose by 0.4 percent last month, marking an annual increase of 5.4 percent.\nReporting by Richard Leong; Editing by Chizu Nomiyama\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-01-13T00:47:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-13T14:46:20.016+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
