The Dow hit the 26,000-mark for the first time but closed more than 200 points below that level.\nThe CBOE Volatility index also perked up on Tuesday, rising to a more than one-month high to 12.41.\nApple shares fell 0.33 percent after Longbow Research downgraded the company’s stock to “neutral”, saying it forecasts only a “good, not great iPhone cycle”.\nFord slipped 3.8 percent after the automaker reported full-year 2017 profit below estimates and provided a downbeat forecast.\nIBM shares rose 1.8 percent after Barclays analysts upgraded its stock to “overweight” and hiked price target by $59 to $192.\nData on industrial production, due at 9:15 a.m. ET, is expected to show a gain of 0.4 percent in December from a 0.2 percent rise in the month before.\nInvestors will also parse the Federal Reserve’s Beige Book, a compendium of anecdotes on the health of the economy drawn from the central bank’s sources, expected at 2:00 p.m. ET.\nCleveland Fed President Loretta Mester, Chicago Fed Chief Charles Evans and their Dallas counterpart Robert Kaplan are scheduled to speak later in the day.
