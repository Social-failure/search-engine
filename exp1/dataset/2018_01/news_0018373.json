The justices will hear Schlumberger’s appeal of a lower court ruling that barred it from recovering more than $93 million stemming from foreign contracts the company said it lost as a result of the infringement. \nThe case involves four patents owned by Schlumberger subsidiary WesternGeco related to an invention that more efficiently completes marine seismic surveys to help identify oil and gas drilling locations. \nION developed a competing system and sold it to surveying companies abroad. WesternGeco sued in 2009, and a federal jury in Houston, where both firms are based, found that Ion infringed the patents and caused the company to lose contracts. The jury awarded $12.5 million in royalties and $93.4 million in lost profits. \nIn 2015, the Washington-based U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, which specializes in patent disputes, ruled that Schlumberger could not recoup the lost profits portion, saying U.S. patent law does not apply outside the country. \nSchlumberger appealed to the Supreme Court. The company said the ruling will harm innovation by allowing companies to infringe competitors’ patents while risking minimal punishment. \nPresident Donald Trump’s administration, backing Schlumberger, urged the court to take the case. \nThe court is likely to decide the case by the end of June, when its current term ends.
