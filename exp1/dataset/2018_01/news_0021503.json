He also called it a “scheme” to give away assets to select creditors and reward management while hurting shareholders.\nThe stakes are especially high for Breitburn’s shareholders because it is structured as a “master limited partnership,” which provides tax advantages when the company is profitable. But investors in such companies can lose more than 100 percent of their investment if the company does not make a profit.\nBreitburn lawyer Ray Schrock urged U.S. Bankruptcy Court Judge Stuart Bernstein to approve the reorganization plan and bring the complex, 18-month bankruptcy to a close.\nThe plan, which envisions splitting Breitburn’s oil and gas assets into two new companies, has the support of creditors holding more than $3 billion in claims. Two creditor groups will own the new companies.\nIn helping to craft the plan, Breitburn’s investment banker Lazard Freres & Co estimated the company’s enterprise value, which includes debt and equity, at about $1.6 billion.\nThe equity committee estimates Breitburn is worth $3.8 billion, a valuation that would ensure some recovery on their investment and eliminate a tax charge.\nBreitburn, however, has said the equity holders are about $1.5 billion shy of break-even.\nBreitburn filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in 2016 after oil prices had slumped to below $30 a barrel from more than $100 in 2014, triggering a wave of bankruptcies across the energy industry. Oil futures have since rebounded, trading above $60 per barrel in recent weeks to hit three-year highs. [O/R]\nNew stock in energy-related companies, such as Peabody Energy Corp and C&J Energy Services that exited bankruptcy last year, have rallied.\nUnder Breitburn’s plan, unsecured creditors led by Elliott Management Corp and WL Ross & Co would own choice Permian Basin assets in Texas through a company formed through a $775 million rights offering.\nUnsecured creditors with $793 million of debt would own a second company with oil reserves in California, the Rocky Mountains, the U.S. Midwest and Southeast. Retail bondholders would receive pennies on the dollar.\nEditing by Dave Gregorio and G Crosse\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-11T17:27:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-11T18:06:03.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
