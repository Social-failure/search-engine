He did not name the institutions.\nThe strengthening of the baht has been driven by a weaker dollar, Thailand’s high current account surplus and larger capital inflows, although inflows are not particularly high when compared with those of other countries.\nThe baht eased to 31.98 per dollar at 0705 GMT after the central bank’s comment from 31.91 earlier. But it has appreciated by 11 percent against the greenback since the start of 2017.\n“The baht is not a major factor for export growth. Despite the baht’s strength, our exports have expanded well,” he said.\nExports, a key driver of Southeast Asia’s second-largest economy, jumped 10 percent in the first 11 months of 2017 from a year earlier after years of poor numbers.\nThe central bank forecast export growth of 9.3 percent for 2017 and 4 percent for 2018.\nHowever, the strong baht has impacted profits of some exporters that make money in dollars but buy domestic raw materials in baht, he said.\n“Therefore, in the short term we will ‘take care’ of exchange rates so that they won’t affect these groups,” he said.\nThe baht will continue to be volatile, so businesses should hedge against foreign exchange risks while enhancing competitiveness and productivity for higher pricing power, Veerathai said.\nAdditional reporting by Satawasin Staporncharnchai; Writing by Orathai Sriring; Editing by Sam Holmes\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-01-17T16:12:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-18T16:13:13.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
