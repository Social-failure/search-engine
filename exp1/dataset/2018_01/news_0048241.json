They denied the charges. \n“We welcome the release of Baquer Namazi given his deteriorating health but we note that his release is only temporary,” said Heather Nauert, U.S. State Department spokeswoman. She added that the United States urged the full release of Namazi and his son “as well as other Americans unjustly held by the Iranian government.” \nIran does not recognise dual citizenship and judiciary officials have said both men would be treated as Iranian citizens in the legal process.
