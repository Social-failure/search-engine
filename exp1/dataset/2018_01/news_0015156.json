I’m sure they’ll have fond memories and we’ll go back there looking to work hard again,” said Burnley skipper Ben Mee. \nAfter rising as high as fourth in December, Burnley have not managed a win in their last five league games, although they have come off a tough run of fixtures which included a narrow loss to a late goal against Liverpool and a draw against Manchester United at Old Trafford. \nWhile Burnley can expect a much tougher test than they faced at Turf Moor in September against a much-improved Palace, they themselves may also pose a different threat following the loan signing of French winger Georges-Kevin Nkoudou from Tottenham. \nWith Irish winger Robbie Brady out with a long-term knee injury and his replacement Scott Arfield also battling for fitness, the former Marseille wide-man could make his debut on Saturday. \nNkoudou has started just three games for Spurs since arriving in the summer of 2016, but he has appeared off the bench nine times in the Premier League and Burnley manager Sean Dyche believes his speed will be an asset. \n“He hasn’t played a lot but we believe he is a wide player who has pace, is direct and a bit unknown,” Dyche said. \n“We will make a decision whether we think he should start, or start on the bench. But he will be involved”.
