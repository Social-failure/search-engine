The appointment of Alessandro Michele as creative director in 2015 (described by Vogue as a \"relative unknown\" and \"daring\") has also appealed to the younger group, UBS suggested.\nPeter White | Getty Images Model Mica Arganaraz walks the runway during the Louis Vuitton show at Paris Fashion Week on October 3, 2017 Louis Vuitton, meanwhile, has 20.7 million followers on Instagram, and 33 percent of its customers are millennials, according to UBS estimates.\nGucci was the largest share gainer of luxury fashion brands over five years (privately-owned Chanel is not included), with 11.8 percent of the market in 2013 increasing to 14.5 percent in 2017, according to UBS estimates. It gained share from Prada, for example, which had a 10.9 percent share of the luxury market in 2013, but this decreased to 7.1 percent in 2017.\n\nGoogle searches for Gucci and Louis Vuitton are ahead of Chanel, Prada and Burberry; searches for luxury fashion brands peak each December, UBS's report said.\nKering had an 80 percent increase in its share price in 2017 and UBS expects organic sales at the luxury group to increase 8 percent in 2018, while it estimates that sales at smaller brand Prada will grow 3 percent, while at Burberry they will be flat.\nThe luxury fashion market in general is \"back in vogue,\" according to UBS, and it forecasts a 7 percent growth in the sector in 2018, driven in part by middle-class Chinese consumers.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-09T16:56:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-09T17:21:09.014+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
