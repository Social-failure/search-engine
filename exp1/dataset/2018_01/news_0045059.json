The two regional banks had collapsed after years of mismanagement and poor lending. \nIn an emailed statement, Intesa said it had bought only certain assets of Veneto Banca and Popolare di Vicenza, and the acquisition had nothing to do with events of the past. \n“Intesa Sanpaolo will not hesitate to defend itself and will exercise all legal and contractual rights,” the bank said. \nEarlier on Friday, a consumer association said an Italian judge had accepted their request to include Intesa in a trial against former executives of the two Veneto-based lenders for alleged obstruction of regulators.
