He also denied any political pressure on the SEC to target the president’s critics.\nRappler has repeatedly drawn the ire of Duterte, who called it a “fake news outlet” after it said his closest aide, Bong Go, had intervened in a naval frigate project.\nReporting by Manuel Mogato and Neil Jerome Morales; Editing by Clarence Fernandez\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-29T13:53:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-29T14:07:13.001+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
