Today, the same experts at research company IQVIA, previously known as IMS Health, suggest it is more likely to be around $25 billion. \nWalmsley’s tenure since she took over in April 2017 has been marked by tough reviews of existing activities, leading to plans to divest some product lines, as well as a major overhaul of GSK’s drug research pipeline. \nShe announced in July 2017 that GSK would create a new, more competitive operating model for its emerging markets business, which set the stage for the African shake-up. \nGSK will no longer market medicines to healthcare professionals in 29 sub-Saharan African markets and instead adopt a distributor-led model. \nHowever, the group will continue to run local operations in Kenya and Nigeria, and South Africa will remain managed by the drugmaker’s local partner Aspen Pharmacare. GSK will also retain representative offices in Ivory Coast and Ghana. \nThe company said the changes, which were agreed at the end of last year, would not stop it working with governments and multilateral agencies like the World Health Organization, Unicef and the vaccines group GAVI. \n“Patient access to medicines and vaccines will not be affected by this change,” the spokesman said. \nThe decision is an about-turn from the strategy laid out by former CEO Andrew Witty in March 2014 when GSK set out plans to make targeted investments of up to 130 million pounds ($179 million) in Africa and create hundreds of jobs. \nUnder Witty, GSK went further than many other companies in committing to fair prices in developing countries, with a pledge to cap the prices of its patented medicines at no more than 25 percent of developed world prices.
