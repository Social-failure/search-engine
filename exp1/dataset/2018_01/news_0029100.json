Coltrane played a Selmer Mark VI tenor on his classic “A Love Supreme” album. Former U.S. President Bill Clinton played a Selmer for a sax solo during the 1992 election. More recently, French astronaut Thomas Pesquet played one on the International Space Station. \n“Actually there’s more demand than supply right now,” said Louis Godron, a partner at Argos Soditic. “We need to better respond to that demand by improving productivity,” he added. \nGodron notably pointed to a need for better stock management and faster production methods. The company, which is profitable, generated revenues of 35 million euros ($42.82 million) in 2017. It employs 500 staff.
