Slideshow (2 Images) \n“If I was playing Melania Trump -- not that I would probably be cast in that role -- I wouldn’t be necessarily coming from the place of ‘Free Melania’,” she continued to chuckles in the audience. \n“I’d be trying to understand the situation so that you could then throw that back at an audience and say: ‘What’s her position as a woman? What does she think? What’s it like being married to -- you know’.” \nBlanchett was honored by the WEF on Monday, along with singer Elton John and Bollywood actor Shah Rukh Khan, for raising awareness about human rights. \nAt the panel on Tuesday, her voice broke as she described meeting a Syrian refugee family in Jordan that had been forced to flee their country under gunfire, with the father jettisoning suitcases so he could carry his children across the border.
