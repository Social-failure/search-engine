REUTERS/Edgard Garrido Antonio Tejada, a 33-year-old laborer at the protests, said Hernandez “had stolen the presidency against the will of the people.”\n“We will keep fighting until he is out of power,” he said.\nInternational observers said last year’s election was marred by irregularities and the Organization of American States called for a new vote.\nSlideshow (17 Images) But the result was eventually ratified by the country’s electoral tribunal and both Mexico and the United States backed the incumbent.\nFollowing a contentious decision by the Supreme Court in 2015, Hernandez is the first president to be re-elected since the end of military rule nearly four decades ago.\nHernandez has pledged to maintain a hard-line strategy in his fight against the country’s gangs, which has helped curb the murder rate, despite human rights groups’ allegations of abuses.\nHe was applauded by investors in his first term for cutting the deficit and boosting economic growth and he pledged to bring peace to Honduras and promote prosperity on Saturday.\nAbout 60 percent of Hondurans are mired in poverty while much of the country is terrorized by gang violence, driving tens of thousands of people a year to flee for the United States.\nAdditonal reporting by Diego Ore in Mexico City; Writing by Michael O'Boyle; Editing by Lisa Von Ahn and Bill Trott\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-27T16:57:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-27T17:09:33.015+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
