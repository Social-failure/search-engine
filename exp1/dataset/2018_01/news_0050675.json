Offering a resort lifestyle just a bridge away from the city, Sentosa is the only place in Singapore that foreigners can buy landed property. \nOnce a Malay graveyard and a British military base in the colonial period, Sentosa was developed as a tourist attraction in the 1970s, when it was enlarged through land reclamation to merge with two neighboring islets. \nIt was during the 2000s, when the government actively sought to persuade Asia’s jetsetters to take up residence in Singapore, that the Sentosa Cove residential enclave was developed. \nConstructed on more reclaimed land, and hosting over 2,000 homes, Sentosa Cove has private houses, but 80 percent of the properties are condominium apartments overlooking the marina and man-made waterways snaking through the complex. \n“That kind of lifestyle, you can’t get it anywhere else in Singapore,” said realtor Bruce Lye, whose agency SRI is currently marketing several properties including a house that comes with a Lamborghini sports car. \nBut nowhere is perfect. \nWhen Singapore’s property market began a slide in end-2013 that lasted for nearly four years, Sentosa was hardest hit. \nDuring the downturn, prices for Sentosa Cove apartments fell 35 percent from where they started 2013 compared with a 10 percent drop on the mainland, according to real estate services firm Colliers International. \nThe Singapore market stabilized in 2017, recording its first annual rise in four years, albeit a meager 1.1 percent, and even Sentosa stopped falling. \n“Sentosa prices appear to be finding a footing,” Tricia Song, Colliers’ head of Singapore research, referring to apartments as the market for houses is more rarefied and difficult to assess. \nSong expects Sentosa properties to lag prime real estate on the mainland as the location is less convenient for most people.

Otherwise, access and connectivity to the mainland are awkward for residents. \nMotorists have to use a causeway, though jams have been reduced by a one-way tunnel for traffic leaving Sentosa that was opened in April. \nThe kids might still have a longer commute to school than their classmates, and residents may pay over the odds for groceries, but these are choices that some people can afford to make. \nA Singaporean woman who runs a commercial property business and lives with her husband in a Sentosa Cove apartment that she paid S$3.8 million ($2.91 million) for in 2016, and she isn’t cribbing.

It expects deals to increase further in 2018. \n“As prices in Sentosa Cove have fallen significantly, some buyers are seeing value in the properties there, leading to a pick-up in transaction volume,” said Ong Teck Hui, JLL’s national director of research, Singapore. \nMorgan Stanley forecast Singapore prices will increase 8 percent in 2018 and Credit Suisse forecast prices to go up by as much as 10 percent. \nOng predicts average prices of non-landed homes on Sentosa could rise 4-7 percent this year.
