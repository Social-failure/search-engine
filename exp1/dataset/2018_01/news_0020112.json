He gave no more details.\nTrump reportedly made the remarks at a private meeting with lawmakers on immigration on Thursday. A U.S. senator who attended the gathering said the president used “vile, vulgar” language, including repeatedly using the word “shithole” when speaking about African countries.\nThe U.S. president on Friday denied using such derogatory language. But he has been widely condemned in many African countries and by international rights organizations. African Union countries demanded an apology on Friday.\nReporting by Felix Onuah; writing by Alexis Akwagyiram; editing by Mark Heinrich\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-15T18:12:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-15T18:21:54.010+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
