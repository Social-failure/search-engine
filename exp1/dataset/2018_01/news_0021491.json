It is different from the figure monitored by Greece’s EU/IMF lenders but indicates the state of the country’s finances.\nNet tax revenue came in at 48.8 billion euros, 110 million euros above target, while spending reached 55.5 billion euros, 1.75 billion euros below target.\nThe government projects a general government primary budget surplus of 2.4 percent of economic output last year, based on its 2018 budget. The bailout target was a primary surplus of 1.75 percent of GDP.
