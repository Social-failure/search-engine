The tournament takes place from June 14 to July 15.\n“Of course, we are preparing for this event (the World Cup),” he said. “We are currently discussing the regulations for the data to be supplied to the organizing committee.”\nVilfand, who did not disclose the cost of the World Bank-funded supercomputer, added discussions were taking place about when to release match-day forecasts and how much detail they should contain.\n“I hope we will launch the first (weather forecasting) models with high resolution and then be able to describe weather in great detail,” he said.\nVilfand stressed that additional forecasts will be needed for the 32 teams’ training bases and for flight and road conditions between host cities.\nRussian authorities expect three million to five million fans to travel in Russia during the World Cup.\nReporting by Polina Devitt; editing by Gabrielle Tétrault-Farber and William Maclean\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-16T15:45:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-16T16:01:50.051+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
