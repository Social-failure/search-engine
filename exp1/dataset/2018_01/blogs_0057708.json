The stock, which hit an all-time high Monday, looks well-positioned into earnings, said Michael Bapis, partner and managing director at the Bapis Group at HighTower Advisors, Tuesday on CNBC's \" Trading Nation .\" Here are his reasons why. • Microsoft has made strides in the blockchain technology space. Last year the company was involved in a blockchain initiative related to marine insurance. • The company has, too, expanded its footprint in the cloud computing and gaming space. On Monday, Microsoft said it had acquired a start-up with cloud-based tools for game developers. • KeyBanc analysts wrote earlier this month that Amazon lost cloud market share to Microsoft in the fourth quarter. The stock fell 1 percent Tuesday, closing negative for its second straight day, amid a broad market sell-off. Bottom line: One trader is bullish on Microsoft ahead of its quarterly earnings report.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-31T13:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-31T14:17:53.003+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
