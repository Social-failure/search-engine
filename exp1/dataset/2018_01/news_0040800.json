This measure of overall auction demand was 2.52 at the prior two-year note sale in December.\nThe latest two-year issue was priced at a yield of 2.066 percent, the highest since September 2008.\n“Overall a solid result, though we’re not as optimistic that the 5-year will receive the same reception,” Aaron Kohli, interest rate strategist at BMO Capital markets, wrote in a note.\nThe Treasury will sell $34 billion of five-year notes on Wednesday and $28 billion seven-year notes on Thursday.\nIn the “when-issue” market at 2:10 p.m. EST (1910 GMT), traders expected the upcoming five-year and seven-year issues to sell at yields of 2.424 percent and 2.557 percent , respectively, according to Tradeweb.\nReporting by Richard Leong; Editing by Tom Brown and Matthew Lewis\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-01-24T03:52:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-24T15:44:45.001+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
