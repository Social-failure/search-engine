Source: ICCT Fuel efficiency of 20 airlines on transpacific passenger routes, 2016 \nThe report said Qantas recorded poor fuel efficiency because it used older, fuel-intensive aircraft, carried a low amount of freight (therefore making it less efficient) and also had relatively low numbers of passengers on each plane. \nIn a statement Tuesday, Qantas Head of Fuel and Environment Alan Milne said the airline ranked poorly because \"we use larger aircraft, fly very long distances and have premium cabins that naturally have fewer people on board.\" \nMilne added that the airline's Sydney to Dallas route, as one of the longest in the world, had a magnifying effect on emissions because at take-off there was so much fuel to carry \nQantas was the only airline in the list to have the Airbus A380 as its most prevalent aircraft on transpacific routes. The carrier said it is committed to lowering emissions and would soon be switching old 747's for Boeing's more fuel-efficient Dreamliner range.

ICCT said almost half of the variance among the 20 airlines was due to the amount of freight being carried on each flight. \nIn 2015, the ICCT compared the efficiency of 20 major airlines operating in the transatlantic market. Using a slightly different methodology, that report found British Airways to be the most polluting airline crossing the Atlantic Ocean.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-17T13:14:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-17T13:18:31.003+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
