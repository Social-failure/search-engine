He expected the rate to fall below 10 percent in 2019.\nInflation has climbed since Egypt floated its currency, the pound, in November 2016, reaching a record high of 35 percent in July after energy subsidies were cut. It has gradually eased since July.\nEgypt’s central bank has raised key interest rates by 700 basis points since November 2016 in an attempt to ease soaring inflation.\nEconomists expect it to start cutting the rates in coming months as inflationary pressure ease.
