Mega Millions tickets are offered in the same locations excluding Puerto Rico.\nThe largest Powerball jackpot was a $1.6 billion payout split among winners in California, Florida and Tennessee in January 2016, the association said. The largest Mega Millions jackpot of $656 million was won in 2012.\nNo one has hit either jackpot since October, allowing the totals to balloon. On Wednesday, no one won the Powerball jackpot worth an estimated $460 million. A day earlier, no one matched all six numbers in Mega Millions drawing, lottery officials said.\nThe estimated totals are before taxes are assessed.\nThe odds of a single ticket hitting all six numbers in the Powerball are 292 million to 1, according to the Multi-State Lottery Association. The odds of picking the right six numbers for the Mega Millions jackpot are 303 million to 1, the game said.\n\"When the jackpots reach these levels, everyone starts to daydream about what they would do if they won,\" Gordon Medenica, Mega Millions lead director, said in a statement.
