We never thought about 23 medals and for sure I don’t think now even about 23 medals. I think it’s highly impossible.” \nPart of the reason is because their success caused a spike in demand for coaches from the Netherlands, a trend that could level the playing field slightly. \n“There are more countries looking in the direction of hiring Dutch coaches and that’s basically been since Sochi,” said Bart Schouten, a Dutchman who has been working with the Canadian team for the past eight seasons. \n“There’s definitely an export of Dutch coaches going to different countries around the world to try to increase the international level of speed skating.” \nJapan, Germany, China and hosts South Korea have all brought in Dutch coaches to help their skaters, with the Japanese women’s team in particular impressing in the past two seasons under Johan de Wit. \nBob de Jong, who won bronze in the 10,000m in Sochi, one of four events the Dutch swept, described the last Olympics as an aberration. \n“Sochi was extreme. It was absolutely unreal,” the 2006 Olympic champion told Reuters from Seoul, where he is helping to coach South Korea.

We were getting fast, but not unbelievably fast.” RULE CHANGES \nIn Sochi, the Dutch swept the men’s 500m, 5,000m and 10,000m, while in the women’s 1,500m, they took the top four positions.

But it is what it is, you know.” \nThe Dutch medal count may dip on the long track, but De Jong expects the country to make inroads in the short track events. \n“In Sochi they took the first Olympic medal in short track,” he said. \n“I will say they will take three or four medals in short track skating now.” Editing by Greg Stutchbury", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-14T15:33:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-14T16:42:38.006+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
