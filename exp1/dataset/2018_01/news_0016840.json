The FPO are not just populists - they are an enemy of democracy,” said Benjamin Abtan, president of the European Grassroots Anti-Racist Movement, who spoke at the event.

They should not have a seat at the top tables in Europe.” \nAbtan cited comments from Interior Minister Herbert Kickl of the FPO, who last week said asylum seekers should be “concentrated” in special centers to help the authorities process their applications swiftly. \nThe wording evoked Nazi-era concentration camps and triggered a storm of protest in Austria. \nSenior FPO figure Norbert Hofer on Saturday told Austrian radio that Kickl’s comments were not maliciously or consciously meant, and that human rights would be respected in dealing with asylum seekers.   in Zurich and Francois Murphy in Vienna; editing by Clelia Oziel", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-01-14T01:18:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-13T19:34:37.002+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
