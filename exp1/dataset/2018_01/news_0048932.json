Hyundai Motor declined to comment.\nHyundai Motor reported last week its worst annual earnings in seven years, battered by its delayed response to the burgeoning SUV market and a diplomatic row with China.\nA firmer local currency also adds to the woes of the automaker, as it is eating into its profits repatriated from overseas and hurts the price competitiveness of its exports in the United States and other markets.\n“The mission of the Santa Fe is to recover Hyundai’s U.S. market share. It carries a big burden on its shoulder,” said Ko Tae-bong, a senior auto analyst at Hi Investment & Securities. The U.S. sales of the aging Santa Fe climbed 1.5 percent last year even as U.S. industry SUV and truck sales rose 4 percent.\nThe model, expected in the U.S. market in the third quarter of this year, will be also “key to recovering the utilisation rate of Hyundai’s factory in Alabama”, Ko said.\nHyundai’s U.S. sales fell 12 percent last year, making it the worst performer among automakers in that market, hit by the conservative design of the Sonata and the Elantra sedans and an absence of a broadbased SUV line-up.\nHyundai, which has three SUV models - Kona, Tucson and Santa Fe - has said it would diversify its SUV line-up by launching a mini-SUV and a large SUV.\nHyundai Motor shares ended up 0.97 percent in the wider market which sank 1.17 percent on Tuesday.\nReporting by Hyunjoo Jin; Editing by Muralikumar Anantharaman and Louise Heavens\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-30T08:03:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-30T08:22:27.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
