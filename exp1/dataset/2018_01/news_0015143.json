But I rejected that, there is something more artistic about it that most people are not seeing because not everyone participates and gets the chance to see it up close,” he said. \nVoodoo is estimated to be more than 500 years old and centered on the worship of a range of gods and spirits. \nIt is now the official religion of Benin despite the criticism and stigma attached to it. Voodoo was banned by Mathieu Kerekou after he came to power in 1972 via a military coup, but his elected successor Nicephore Soglo lifted the ban in the early 1990s. \nCentral to Voodoo is the belief in sacrifice and traditional medicines as a way to heal ailments and help worshippers get closer to sprits and the afterworld.
