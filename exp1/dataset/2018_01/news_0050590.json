It also pledged to keep interest rates at their current, ultra-low levels for long after that purchases stop. \nInflation in the euro zone is comfortably above 1 percent but it is not expected to hit the ECB’s target for years to come. \n”Even if incoming data were to validate the expectation of a gradual build-up of inflationary pressures, this would not be sufficient to affirm a sustained adjustment, if even less supportive monetary policy conditions were to imperil the inflation trajectory, Praet said. \nYet the Dutch governor, Klaas Knot, said in an interview published at the weekend that he saw “no reason whatsoever to continue the programme” and that President Mario Draghi was keeping his options open to curb a rise in the euro against the dollar. \nThe euro’s rise is damaging for inflation because it makes exports dearer and imports cheaper. \n($1 = 0.8051 euros)", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-29T12:59:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-29T13:26:58.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
