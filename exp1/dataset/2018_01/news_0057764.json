The Dow is up 67 percent and the S&P 500 gained 59 percent.\nSources: Reuters, FactSet\nIt was just over nine years ago that the Federal Reserve took the fed funds rate to zero during the financial crisis, but it was the Yellen Fed that brought it back, raising interest rates for the first time since the financial crisis in December 2015. The Fed has since hiked four more times, and during Yellen's tenure, the S&P financials, big beneficiaries of higher rates, rose 74 percent.

The 10-year yield just recently rose above its 2.66 percent 2014 level and was at 2.74 percent Wednesday as Yellen held her final meeting as chair amid expectations for higher interest rates.\nSources: Reuters, FactSet\n.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-31T19:34:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-31T19:33:56.045+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
