Dallas had a 26-15 advantage in shots on goal.\nTrevor Daley and Andreas Athanasiou scored for the Red Wings, who had won five of their previous seven games. Tyler Bertuzzi assisted on both Detroit goals, and Athanasiou also had a two-point game. Detroit’s Jimmy Howard stopped 22 shots in defeat.\nDaley, who played for the Stars from 2003-15, scored just 44 seconds into the game. He fired in a shot from the slot after a Bertuzzi pass from behind the Dallas net.\nThe Stars tied it up a little over two minutes later on Faksa’s 11th goal. Klingberg increased his assist streak to eight consecutive games on the play. He is the first Dallas defenseman to record at least one point for that long of a stretch since Sergei Zubov had a nine-game streak from March 24-April 15, 2006.\nThe Stars took advantage of a five-on-three situation midway through the first period to take a 2-1 lead. Spezza tipped in a Klingberg shot for his sixth goal at 8:55.\nBertuzzi notched his second assist of the game on Athanasiou’s goal at the 11:43 mark of the second period. Bertuzzi sent a pass from his own end to Athanasiou, who received it just before the blue line and streaked in to beat Bishop from close range.\nSpezza answered with his second power-play tally at 14:08 to put Dallas back in front 3-2. The Stars had the man advantage after the Red Wings’ Luke Witkowski was assessed a roughing infraction along with a five-minute fighting penalty after a tussle with Stephen Johns, who received only a fighting penalty.\nHanzal gave the Stars some breathing room at the 9:13 mark of the third.\nDallas won the first meeting this season 4-2 on its home ice Oct. 10.\n--Field Level Media\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-01-17T11:37:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-17T20:10:14.018+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
