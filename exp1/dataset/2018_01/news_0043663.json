One bitcoin was worth around $11,150 on Thursday morning, down from a high of around $19,000 last month.\nTT also counts Goldman Sachs Group Inc ( GS.N ) , JPMorgan Chase and Co ( JPM.N ), and most other Wall Street banks as clients, as well as many Chicago- and London-based proprietary trading firms.\n“We’ve had a lot of demand from the institutional trading community, everything from the traditional buy-side, hedge funds, managed accounts, the prop community, that I think have been looking for a bridge like this as a way to trade the crypto markets against the cash markets,” Rick Lane, TT’s chief executive officer, said in an interview.\nThe Chicago-based firm will also be rolling out enhanced surveillance tools to help police crypto-trading in the coming months, Lane said.\nCoinbase, which is regulated under the New York Department of Financial Services BitLicense, also said it would soon introduce a new custodian offering with strict financial controls and secure storage for institutional traders wanting to trade digital currencies like bitcoin.\nReporting by John McCrank; Editing by Andrea Ricci\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-25T17:54:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-25T18:16:58.008+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
