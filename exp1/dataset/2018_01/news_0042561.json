The American, who has won 10 World Cup races this season, quickly got back up and looked annoyed with herself.\nShe leads the overall standings on 1,477 points, ahead of Liechtenstein’s Tina Weirather in a distant second on 601.\nThe 22-year-old is a favourite for next month’s Winter Games in Pyeongchang, where she is widely expected to retain the slalom title she won at the 2014 Games in Sochi, Russia, as well as having a shot at gold in both the giant slalom and Super G.\nNorwegian Ragnhild Mowinckel was fastest on the first leg.
