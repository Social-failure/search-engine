The index also remained above the 50 threshold that separates contraction from expansion for the 16th straight month.\n“The Japanese manufacturing sector concluded Q4 with the highest PMI reading since February 2014,” said Joe Hayes, economist at IHS Markit, which compiles the survey.\nA worker cycles near a factory at the Keihin industrial zone in Kawasaki, Japan, November 15, 2017.
