I think the move is looking increasingly overdone.” said Esiner.\nReporting by Saqib Iqbal Ahmed; Additional reporting by Jennifer Ablan; Editing by Meredith Mazzilli\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-01-23T00:32:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-23T18:16:55.014+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
