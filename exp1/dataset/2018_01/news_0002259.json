The second girl was not one of the abducted Chibok students.\nOf the 276 girls who were originally taken, about 60 escaped soon afterwards. Around 100 are still believed to be in captivity.\nLast May, Boko Haram exchanged 82 of the girls after mediation, involving a payment to the insurgents and the release of some of the group’s imprisoned senior members. Before that, 24 had been released or found in 2016.\nThe Chibok case attracted global attention, but aid groups say Boko Haram has kidnapped thousands more adults and children, many of whose cases are neglected.\n(Corrects spelling of rescued girl’s name in third paragraph to “Salomi Pogu” after error in initial military statement)\nReporting by Paul Carsten; Editing by Ralph Boulton\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-04T16:19:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-04T16:44:18.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
