(NASDAQ: EGOV), the leading provider of digital government services, today announced net income of $10.8 million and earnings per share of 16 cents on total revenues of $83.5 million for the three months ended December 31, 2017. In the fourth quarter of 2016, the Company reported net income of $13.6 million and earnings per share of 20 cents on total revenues of $78.3 million.\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2017, the Company’s effective tax rate was 38 percent, compared to 19 percent in the fourth quarter of 2016. NIC’s effective tax rate in the current year quarter reflects a one-time charge totaling approximately $0.3 million to revalue the Company’s net deferred tax assets as of December 31, 2017 based on the anticipated reduction of NIC’s prospective effective tax rate resulting from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, which was signed into law on December 22, 2017. This discrete tax item reduced earnings per share in the current quarter by approximately 1 cent. The Tax Act, among other changes, reduces the statutory federal corporate income tax rate from 35 percent to 21 percent, and the Company will begin receiving the benefit of the reduced rate starting January 1, 2018, which will be offset by changes in certain deductions, most notably the elimination of the domestic production activities deduction. Based on information currently available, the Company currently expects its effective tax rate, before any discrete items, to range from 24 to 25 percent in 2018. These tax-related estimates may differ from actual results due to change in interpretations of the Tax Act and assumptions made by the Company, as well as guidance that may be issued and actions the Company may take as a result of the Tax Act.\nThe lower effective tax rate in the prior year quarter was primarily attributable to favorable benefits related to the amendment of the Company’s fiscal 2014 and 2013 tax returns to include the Section 199 domestic production activities deduction. These discrete tax items increased earnings per share in the prior year quarter by approximately 3 cents.\nFourth Quarter 2017 Performance\nFourth quarter 2017 portal revenues were $78.4 million, a 7 percent increase over the fourth quarter of 2016. On a same state basis, portal revenues increased 6 percent over the prior year quarter. Same state revenues from Interactive Government Services (IGS) increased 13 percent over the prior year quarter, driven by a variety of transaction-based services including vehicle registrations and corporation filings, among others. Same state transaction-based revenues from Driver History Record (DHR) services were flat compared to the fourth quarter of 2016, while same state software development revenues decreased 27 percent from the prior year quarter, driven mainly by fewer time & materials projects across various NIC portal states.\nFourth quarter 2017 revenues from Illinois, the Company’s newest partnership, totaled $2.4 million in fixed-fee project revenues from the delivery of the first phase of an enterprise licensing and permitting platform. In the prior year quarter, revenues from the legacy Tennessee portal contract totaled $1.5 million, while revenues from the legacy Iowa portal contract totaled $0.2 million. As previously announced, the Company’s contract with the state of Tennessee expired on March 31, 2017, and the Company’s contract with the state of Iowa expired on November 30, 2016.\nSoftware & services revenues were $5.1 million, up 1 percent from the fourth quarter of 2016, driven by an increase in transactional revenues from the federal Pre-employment Screening Program and other payment processing services.\nNIC’s operating income increased 4 percent over the prior year quarter to $17.4 million for the fourth quarter of 2017, and the Company’s operating income margin was 21 percent in both the current and prior year quarters.\nOn January 29, 2018, the Company’s Board of Directors declared a regular quarterly cash dividend of 8 cents per share, payable to stockholders of record as of March 6, 2018. The dividend, which is expected to total approximately $5.4 million based on the current number of shares outstanding, will be paid on March 20, 2018, out of the Company’s available cash.\n“We have a diversified portfolio of solutions that continued to drive healthy revenue growth,” said NIC Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board Harry Herington. “I look forward to our focus on innovation continuing to build that portfolio in the future.”\nOperational Highlights\nDuring the fourth quarter, the state of Mississippi extended its contract with the Company for an additional two years, taking the agreement through December 2019. Recently, the state of Maryland extended its contract with the Company ahead of schedule with a one-year renewal taking the contract through August 2019.\nIn addition, the Company signed a new contract with Liens NC, LLC, a coalition of title insurance underwriters in North Carolina, to continue providing the online lien agent system, Liens NC, for another six years through April 2023.\nMore National Park Service locations recently joined the YourPassNow platform, including Yellowstone National Park, Everglades National Park, and Whiskeytown National Recreation Area. The National Park Service also signed a contract with the Company to make YourPassNow available to any location that would like to participate. The National Park Service currently manages 417 sites, with 118 charging entrance fees.\nFull-Year 2017 Performance\nFiscal year 2017 total revenues rose 6 percent over the prior year to $336.5 million, and portal revenues grew 5 percent to $311.4 million, exceeding the high end of the Company’s total revenue and portal revenue guidance. Portal revenue growth in 2017 was driven by several IGS services, including vehicle registrations and corporate business filings, among others. On a same state basis, portal revenues were 6 percent higher than in 2016, with same state IGS transactional revenues up 11 percent for the year, and same state DHR revenues growing 1 percent. Same state time & materials revenues relating to portal software development decreased 29 percent for the year.\nSoftware & services revenues for fiscal year 2017 were $25.2 million, up 20 percent from 2016, exceeding the high end of the Company’s software & services revenue guidance. The increase in software & services revenue was driven by an increase in revenues from the federal Pre-employment Screening Program and other payment processing services, and by a non-recurring spike in revenues from the sale of lifetime Senior Passes in the third quarter of 2017 through the YourPassNow digital park pass service, managed by NIC on behalf of the National Park Service. Demand for the lifetime Senior Pass increased significantly in July and August of 2017 due to a pending legislative price increase that became effective August 28, 2017.\nFiscal year 2017 operating income increased 1 percent to $78.3 million. NIC’s operating income margin was 23 percent for the year, down from 24 percent in the prior year.\nNIC earned 77 cents per share in 2017, down from 84 cents per share in 2016, exceeding the high end of the Company’s 2017 earnings guidance of 72 cents per share. Results in 2017 include discrete tax items related to excess tax benefits generated upon the vesting of restricted stock awards, an increase in the previously estimated research and development tax credit for the 2016 and 2017 tax years, a release of reserves for unrecognized income tax benefits due to the expiration of statutes of limitations for certain tax years, and the aforementioned one-time charge to revalue the Company’s net deferred tax assets as of December 31, 2017 resulting from new tax laws. Combined, these discrete tax items increased earnings per share in 2017 by approximately 2 cents. Results in 2016 included discrete tax items related to the Section 199 domestic production activities deduction for the 2013 through 2016 tax years and an increase in the previously estimated federal research and development tax credit for the 2015 and 2016 tax years that when combined with other non-recurring tax adjustments, increased earnings per share in 2016 by approximately 10 cents.\nFourth Quarter Earnings Call and Webcast Details\nOn January 31, 2018, the Company will host a call to discuss its 2017 fourth quarter and full-year financial and operational results and to answer questions from the investment community. The call may also include a discussion of Company developments, and forward-looking and other material information about business and financial matters.\nDial-In Information\nWednesday, Jan. 31, 2018 4:30 p.m. (EST) Conference ID: 6230623 Call bridge: 888-394-8218 (U.S. callers) or 323-794-2149 (international callers) Call leaders: Harry Herington, Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board Steve Kovzan, Chief Financial Officer Robert Knapp, Chief Operating Officer Webcast Information\nTo sign in and listen: The Webcast system is available at http://www.egov.com/investor-relations\nA replay of NIC’s fourth quarter earnings call will be available by visiting http://www.egov.com/investor-relations .\nAbout NIC\nNIC Inc.
