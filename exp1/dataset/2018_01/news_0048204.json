The prosecutors’ office said it is investigating the case to identify the culprits. \nWorkers at Mexican refineries are targeted by the criminal gangs, and sources familiar with the situation in Salamanca said Alfonzo had received threats before his death. \nSeveral Pemex workers have been killed in the city in recent years. \nPemex condemned the killing in a statement, and the company’s chief executive officer Carlos Trevino expressed his condolences about the loss of Alfonzo. \nThis week Reuters published an investigation into fuel theft and the problems it is causing in Mexico, which has sought to increase foreign investment by opening up the long-closed oil and gas industry to private firms. \nGuanajuato, a centre of industry in Latin America’s no. 2 economy, has recently suffered a substantial increase in murders, which hit a record high in Mexico in 2017.
