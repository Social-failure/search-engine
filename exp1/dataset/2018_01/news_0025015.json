REUTERS/Thomas White The three men charged on Saturday were not part of an initial 11 charged early last week, according to court documents, bringing the total number of people charged in the case to 14.\nSeventeen people were initially arrested in the case. The fate of the six who were not charged at that time is unclear.\nThe Singapore subsidiary of Royal Dutch Shell Plc first contacted the authorities in August 2017 about theft at its Pulau Bukom industrial site, just south of the country’s main island.\nPolice have seized millions of dollars in cash and a small tanker in the sting operation involving simultaneous raids across Singapore, one of the world’s most important oil trading centers and a major refinery hub.\nExperts say illicit oil trading is widespread in Southeast Asia, where stolen fuel is sold across the region, often offloaded directly into trucks or tanks at small harbors away from oil terminals.\nThis is the second high-profile case of wrongdoing at companies in Singapore to hit headlines in recent weeks. In December, Keppel Corporation Ltd’s KPLM.SI rig-building business agreed to pay more than $422 million to resolve charges it had bribed Brazilian officials.\nReporting by Fathin Ungku; Editing by John Geddie and Gerry Doyle\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "http://tmsnrt.rs/2Dhv6fM"], "published": "2018-01-15T14:24:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-15T09:32:04.006+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
