The company is working on creating more content libraries and next-generation technologies — like a voice controlled remote — to attract customers. \n\"Video is in full disruption,\" he said. \"Our customers have more choices today than they ever had before.\" \nAs for the legality of the AT&T Time Warner deal , Esser said his only concern is to ensure Cox Communications will have access to content, given DirecTV's history of making things exclusive. \n\"Other than that, I'll let the court's figure that one out,\" he said.
