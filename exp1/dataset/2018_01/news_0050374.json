REUTERS/Omar Sobhani MESSAGE TO TRUMP \nHowever, the Taliban have dismissed suggestions they have been weakened and said Saturday’s bombing was a message to President Donald Trump. \n“The Islamic Emirate has a clear message for Trump and his hand kissers, that if you go ahead with a policy of aggression and speak from the barrel of a gun, don’t expect Afghans to grow flowers in response,” Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid said in a statement, using the term the Islamist militants use to describe themselves. \nThe United States and Afghanistan have accused neighboring Pakistan of helping the Taliban in a bid to undermine old rival India’s growing influence in Afghanistan. \nGhani, speaking alongside visiting Indonesian President Joko Widodo, said the Taliban claim of responsibility for the Saturday blast, even though it inflicted so many civilian casualties, showed that their “overlord” wanted to make a statement of defiance.
