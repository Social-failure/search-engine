Durbin blew DACA and is hurting our Military,” Trump added. \nIn remarks to reporters in Chicago, Durbin stood by his account of the meeting. Trump has drawn criticism at home, from Republicans and Democrats, and abroad for the comments attributed to him. \n“I know what happened. I stand behind every word that I said,” Durbin said on Monday. \n“In terms of that meeting, I‘m focused on one thing - not that meeting - but on making sure that those who are being protected by DACA ... have a future in America. I‘m focused on that full-time.” Reporting by Jeff Mason and Tim Ahmann; Editing by Nick Zieminski", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-15T22:51:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-15T23:06:19.057+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
