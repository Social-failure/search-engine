REUTERS/Stoyan Nenov \nOn Friday, the Turkish minister for EU affairs said Ankara would reject any offer of partnership with the European Union that falls short of membership, warning that the current impasse gave Turkey no reason to maintain its migrant deal with the bloc. \nHe also said the EU was not honouring all parts of a deal to stem the flow of migrants westwards from Turkey in return for 3 billion euros ($3.67 billion) in financial aid to Turkey and other support.
