The EU initially appealed the ruling, but decided on Monday to withdraw that appeal. \nArgentina also won a case against the EU anti-dumping duties on its biodiesel filed to the World Trade Organization. Indonesia’s case at the WTO is pending. \nThe European Commission subsequently cut the anti-dumping duties for Argentinean biodiesel last year to between 4.5 and 8.1 percent from initial rates of 22-25.7 percent. The rates for Indonesia remain those set in 2013 - between 8.8 and 20.5 percent. \nThe European Union’s case was based on export duties both countries impose on the raw material, soybeans in the case of Argentina and palm oil for Indonesia. The EU view was that this gave an unfair advantage to biodiesel producers there, allowing them to “dump” product at unfairly low prices. \nArgentina and Indonesia called the anti-dumping duties protectionist. \nThe European Commission did start an investigation in 2012 into alleged subsidies in the sector for both Argentina and Indonesia, but terminated it in 2013 after the EBB withdrew its complaint. \nThe termination came on the same day as the announcement that the EU would be imposing definitive anti-dumping duties on imports.
