Our conditions are harsh ... We won’t be able to endure more.”\nSudan’s government has begun a series of economic reforms in line with International Monetary Fund recommendations aimed at putting the country’s ailing economy back on track.\nState Minister for Finance Magdi Hassan Yaseen told Reuters late last month that the competition between companies importing wheat would prevent such an increase in the prices.\nThe government would buy locally produced wheat at “encouraging prices”, he said.\nThe country devalued its currency, the pound, to 18 per U.S. dollar, more than double its previous peg of 6.7 pounds to the dollar.\nReporting by Khaled Abdelaziz, writing by Dahlia Nehme, editing by Larry King\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-01-06T01:34:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-05T22:28:22.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
