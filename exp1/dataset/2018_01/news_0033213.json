Eleven of the contracts had been terminated.\nIt also saved at least $200 million through value-for-money procurement reviews, he said, without giving details.\nAkufo-Addo, who last week named a special prosecutor to investigate graft, warned that his appointees would not be spared if found culpable of corruption.\nHe also said his government had yet to decide whether to extend the stay of two ex-Guantanamo Bay detainees transferred to Ghana under a special arrangement with the United States.\nThe two Yemeni nationals were sent to Ghana in January 2016 for an initial two-year period after being held for more than a decade at Guantanamo for suspected terrorism.\nReporting by Kwasi Kpodo; editing by Mark Heinrich\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-01-18T02:20:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-18T01:05:33.027+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
