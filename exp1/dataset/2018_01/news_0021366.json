The supplies were scheduled to start in the second quarter of 2018.\n“The two parties have agreed to an adjustment to the price and the volume of LNG supply, thus enabling GAIL to develop incremental gas markets to offtake these volumes, thereby mitigating volume risk,” GAIL said.\nThe move will diversify GAIL’s LNG portfolio by spreading price reference indexes across multiple geographies, so as to give consumers greater flexibility in service, Chairman B. C. Tripathi said in a statement.\nWhen the deal was first signed, Gazprom envisaged supplying India with LNG from its planned Schtokman project in the Barents Sea, which was subsequently scrapped as the shale gas revolution in the United States removed a key customer base.\nThe resulting contractual inconsistency gave GAIL a foothold to re-open the Gazprom deal, sources familiar with the matter said, kicking off talks in which it sought to delay the first LNG deliveries until 2020.\nGazprom Marketing & Trading Chief Executive Vitaly Vasiliev said LNG supplies would begin in 2018.\nIn talks with GAIL, Gazprom discussed changing the origin of the LNG to the newly built Yamal plant in the Russian Arctic, industry sources said.\nGazprom agreed to buy 2.9 million tonnes of LNG per annum over 20 years from Yamal, which shipped its first cargo in December.\nGAIL has also signed contracts for sourcing up to 5.8 million tonnes of LNG from the United States.\nHowever, under GAIL’s 2018 delivery programme, the company does not expect to receive any LNG from the United States following a series of swap deals with Royal Dutch Shell and trader Gunvor, a source with knowledge of the matter said.\nSeparately, GAIL is renegotiating its LNG purchase deals with U.S.-based Cheniere Energy and Dominion Energy, Oil Minister Dharmendra Pradhan told lawmakers last month.\nThe importer over-committed to new LNG volumes earlier this decade when supply was scarce and buyers pounced to sign new deals.\nReporting by Nidhi Verma; Editing by Subhranshu Sahu, Alexander Smith and Adrian Croft\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-16T15:57:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-16T16:12:46.008+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
