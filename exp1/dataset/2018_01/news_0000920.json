That way, the money goes from one IRA to another and never touches your hands.\nYou want to avoid the other way of rolling over an IRA, Slott said, which is the 60-day rollover. This transaction results in the money leaving your IRA with a check payable to you. You then have 60 days to transfer the money into another IRA.\nThe problem with this is that you can only do one per year. That one-year limitation is not according to the calendar year, Slott cautioned, but every 365 days. The once-per-year IRA rollover rule also applies to both IRAs and Roth IRAs.\n\"If you do a second rollover, it's taxable. It cannot be fixed,\" Slott said.\nIf you have already completed one rollover in the last 12 months, the full amount of your IRA could become taxable if you do another rollover. Plus, those who are under 59Â½ will face a 10 percent penalty.\n\"Worst of all, you don't have the IRA tax shelter anymore,\" Slott said. \"You don't have an IRA.\"\nMore from Personal Finance:\nMissing this key retirement deadline could trigger a 50% tax penalty\nTax bill kills this key strategy for how you save for retirement\nThis year-end donation move could reap big savings for retirees", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-02T16:05:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-02T16:19:18.033+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
