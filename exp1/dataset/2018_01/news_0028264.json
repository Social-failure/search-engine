Plemens, President and CEO of the Company, reported, “The acquisitions we have completed over the last several years continue to reap benefits for our shareholders, achieving significant improvements in profitability and efficiency. We have been particularly focused on reaching a return on tangible equity of at least 8% in 2017, a benchmark which we surpassed in the fourth quarter on a core basis. As we look forward to the remainder of 2018 and beyond, we will continue to focus on organic and acquired growth opportunities allowing a return on tangible equity to 10% and greater, while further improving our efficiency ratio. With a tangible common equity to tangible assets ratio of 8.29% at December 31, 2017, we will also continue to consider opportunities to supplement our existing capital base.”\nNet Interest Income\nNet interest income increased $3.5 million, or 37.6%, to $12.7 million for the three months ended December 31, 2017 compared to $9.2 million for the same period in 2016. Net interest income increased $8.4 million, or 24.2%, to $42.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to $34.5 million for the same period in 2016. The increase in net interest income was primarily due to higher volumes in the loan and investment portfolios as well as an increase in the yields earned on cash and investments. Net interest margin for the three months and year ended December 31, 2017 improved to 3.61% and 3.36%, respectively, compared to 3.25% and 3.28% for the same periods in 2016. The net interest margin for the three months ended December 31, 2017 includes approximately 15 basis points of loan fair value accretion income that is not expected to re-occur in the first quarter of 2018.\nProvision for Loan Losses\nThe provision for loan losses was $0.7 million and $1.9 million for the quarter and year ended December 31, 2017, compared to $0.2 million and $0.3 million for the same periods in 2016. The increased provision for loan losses in 2017 was mainly attributable to loan growth. The Company continues to experience modest levels of net charge-offs and non-performing loans.\nNoninterest Income\nNoninterest income decreased $0.9 million, or 48.4%, to $0.9 million for the three months ended December 31, 2017 compared to $1.8 million for the same period in 2016 primarily as the result of a decline in the gains on sale of investment securities. The Company sold approximately $45.0 million of tax exempt municipal securities in December 2017, realizing a loss of $1.1 million, in response to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017. Increases in mortgage banking, trading securities gains, service charges on deposit accounts, interchange fees, and bank-owned life insurance (BOLI) were partially offset by declines in servicing income and gains on sale of SBA loans.\nNoninterest income decreased $1.9 million, or 24.1%, to $6.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to $7.8 million for the same period in 2016. The decrease was primarily related to a decline in the gains on sale of investment securities discussed above as well as other than temporary impairment of $0.8 million realized on two investment securities. Increases in mortgage banking, trading securities gains, service charges on deposit accounts, interchange fees, and BOLI were partially offset by declines in servicing income and gains on sale of SBA loans.\nNoninterest Expense\nNoninterest expense increased $3.3 million, or 43.2%, to $11.1 million for the three months ended December 31, 2017 compared to $7.8 million for the same period in 2016. Noninterest expense increased $4.6 million, or 14.3%, to $36.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to $32.2 million for the same period in 2016. The increases were primarily related to increased compensation and employee benefits and net occupancy expenses as the 2017 periods included the full impact of the Oldtown Bank acquisition, the partial impact of the branches acquired from Stearns Bank, and the Chattahoochee Bank of Georgia (Chattahoochee) acquisition. The 2017 periods also included increased merger-related expenses resulting from the Stearns Bank and Chattahoochee transactions.\nIncome Taxes\nIncome tax expense for the three months and year ended December 31, 2017 was $5.1 million and $7.5 million, respectively, compared to $0.7 million and $3.5 million for t", "external_links": ["https://www.globenewswire.com/NewsRoom/AttachmentNg/faa2c6e2-8a03-48e2-b45c-019ee735d608"], "published": "2018-01-19T00:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-19T00:23:13.003+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
