The operation results showed limited selling interest, suggesting few investors are in a hurry to sell JGBs at current levels.\nU.S. Treasury prices fell on Friday following data showing the world’s biggest economy grew 2.6 percent in the final quarter of 2017.\n$1 = 108.6900 yen Reporting by the Tokyo market team; Editing by Sherry Jacob-Phillips\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-01-29T13:01:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-29T22:00:10.005+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
