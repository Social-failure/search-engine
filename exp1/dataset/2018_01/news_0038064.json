That is well below the estimated 20 times sales that Diageo paid for Casamigos, but Patron is a much more mature business, with estimated sales of about $675 million per year, versus only about $50 million for Casamigos.\nTequila sales, still largely confined to North America, are growing faster than the overall alcoholic drinks market as high-end brands help tequila shrug off its image as a party drink.\nThe acquisition marks the first major deal under Bacardi’s Mahesh Madhavan, who was appointed chief executive in October.\nIt implies that Madhavan’s priorities include growing in the United States, in higher-growth premium brands and growing Patron distribution globally, said Jefferies analysts, noting that this could “make life a little tougher in the United States” for the publicly traded spirits companies.\nPatron, founded more than 25 years ago, was a high-end pioneer, but now competes with a range of brands including Avion, Diageo’s Don Julio and Brown-Forman’s Herradura.\nGlobal tequila sales rose 5.2 percent in 2016, according to research firm IWSR, while the overall market for alcoholic drinks fell 1.3 percent.\nPremium brands are outselling mass-market labels, as consumers increasingly look to “trade up” to more expensive drinks.\nBermuda-based Bacardi was founded in Cuba in 1862, selling its namesake rum. It now owns some 200 brands including Bombay Sapphire gin and Grey Goose vodka. It has owned a minority stake in Patron since 2008.\nThe deal is expected to close in the first half of 2018.\nReporting by Martinne Geller in London and Uday Sampath in Bengaluru; Editing by Sai Sachin Ravikumar and Jason Neely\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-23T00:12:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-23T00:23:01.007+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
