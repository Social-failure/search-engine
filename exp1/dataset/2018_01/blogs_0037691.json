Chez’s site, which went live in 2013, has become one of the most heavily trafficked websites in the world. \nCompetition is heating up. On Thursday, Interncontinental Exchange Inc. ICE, +0.11% , the owner of the New York Stock Exchange, announced a partnership to launch a bitcoin data feed for Wall Street banks and traders. Independent sites including Onchainfx.com have also popped up. \nMeanwhile, Chez’s site is wielding unexpected impact. On January 7, coinmarketcap.com decided to remove trading activity from South Korean exchanges from its price-quote algorithms. The reason: prices there were significantly and persistently higher than in other countries. To some, it seemed the Korean trades were artificially inflating the price of bitcoin. \nRead: South Korea now requires verified ID to trade cryptocurrencies \nYet little is known about how the site operates. Because Chez initially didn’t communicate the change, few if any outside the site knew why it was happening. Traders tried to help each other on message boards like Reddit and social media. Many were angry. ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-24T14:01:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-24T14:11:08.004+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
