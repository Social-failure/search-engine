He continued to speak with Trump and tried to promote the president's agenda.\nBut Trump accused Bannon of having \"lost his mind\" when news of his comments to Wolff surfaced earlier this month. Six days later, Bannon stepped down from his post as executive chairman at Breitbart News.\nBannon is the latest high-profile figure to testify before the House committee as part of its ongoing investigation into allegations that Russia interfered in the U.S. election.\nRussia has denied meddling in the election and Trump has denied there was any collusion between his campaign and Moscow.\nLater in the week, the panel will hear from former Trump campaign manager Corey Lewandowski. In an interview with WABC-AM radio broadcast on Sunday, Lewandowski said he expects the closed-door meeting to take place either Wednesday or Thursday.\n\"I would be happy to come in and sit down. I have nothing to hide,\" he told the radio station. \"I didn't collude or cooperate or coordinate with any Russian, Russian agency, Russian government or anybody else to try and impact this election.\"\nDemocrats on the committee have accused Republicans of rushing to wrap up the probe to help give the president political cover, despite their requests to interview more witness. Republicans have denied the charge.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-16T13:50:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-16T14:46:15.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
