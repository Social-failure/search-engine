Well over 100,000 people have been killed in gang violence in the past decade. \nAs officials grapple to control the bloodshed, President Enrique Pena Nieto last month signed into law a contentious security bill that would formally enshrine the parameters for using the military in crime-fighting. \nA host of human rights groups and international organizations attacked the bill, citing reported cases of abuses by Mexico’s military. \nZavala, 50, said her plan would boost police salaries, offer merit-based promotions and certify officers under a single set of national criteria.
