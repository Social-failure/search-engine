REUTERS/Jonathan Ernst On Monday Volkswagen said that some staff members, whom it did not identify, including some in its legal department, at the VW brand’s technical development division and at Volkswagen of America, had been aware of the tests at the time.\nBut Volkswagen said the study was never discussed in any management board meetings, after Bild earlier reported that an internal e-mail showed that at least some senior managers were informed about the design of the research.\nIn another related development, German daily Stuttgarter Zeitung reported on Sunday that EUGT also sponsored scientific studies testing nitrogen dioxide, a gas found in exhaust fumes, on people.\nAachen University’s research hospital confirmed on Monday that EUGT had sponsored a study in 2013 and 2014 but said it was related to workplace safety, not diesel emissions.\nAs part of the study, 25 people were exposed to varying levels of nitrogen dioxide for three hours to investigate the possible health effects of the chemical compound in concentrations below the limit for workplaces, Uniklinik RWTH Aachen said in a statement.\nThe German government said on Monday that any auto emissions testing on monkeys or people was unjustifiable.\n“These tests on monkeys or even people are in no ethical way justifiable and raise many critical questions about those who are behind the tests,” government spokesman Steffen Seibert told a regular government news conference in Berlin.\nStephan Weil, who represents the German state of Lower Saxony, a VW shareholder, on the carmaker’s supervisory board, said the board was pressing the carmaker to urgently provide information about what the aim of the studies was.\n“After the matter has been cleared up there will also be the question of who was personally responsible,” he said at a news conference on Monday.\nRelated Coverage Germany says emissions tests on monkeys, people are unjustifiable Writing by Maria Sheahan; Editing by Alexander Smith and Adrian Croft\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-01-29T17:31:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-29T11:43:13.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
