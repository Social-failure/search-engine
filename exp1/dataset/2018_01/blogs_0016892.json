The consultancy in November forecast a 111 million tonne harvest. \nThe big Brazilian crop was likely to dominate global export trade markets in the months to come, stealing away market share from U.S. soy exporters. \n\"It is difficult for U.S. soybean exports to recover now as Brazilian new-crop supplies will hit the market at the beginning of February,\" said one India-based agricultural commodities analyst at an international bank. \nWeekly U.S. soybean export sales of 607,400 tonnes and corn sales of 437,800 tonnes were both within analyst estimates. \nBut U.S. wheat exports dropped to 71,500 tonnes, a marketing-season low and below estimates for 250,000 to 450,000 tonnes. \nCBOT March wheat eased to a session low of $4.28-1/4 per bushel in the wake of the export data before paring losses to $4.33-1/2, down 3/4 cent. \nCBOT March corn was down 1/4 cent to $3.48-1/4.
