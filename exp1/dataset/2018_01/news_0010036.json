( on.ft.com/2Fk9jVv ) \nThe sales will be in regions where Sinclair owns two “full power” stations, prohibited under the current Federal Communications Commission rules. \nFox declined to comment while Sinclair did not immediately respond to request for comment. \nFox’s move comes less than a month after it decided to sell its film, television and international businesses to Walt Disney Co for $52.4 billion in stock. However, the talks to buy the Sinclair stations began before Fox engaged in discussions with Disney, one of the sources said. \nBefore Walt Disney’s acquisition, Fox will spin off into a newly listed company its Fox Broadcasting network and stations, Fox News Channel, Fox Business Network, sports channels FS1, FS2 and Big Ten Network.
