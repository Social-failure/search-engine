(NYSE: SAR) (\"Saratoga Investment\" or \"the Company\"), a business development company, today announced financial results for its 2018 fiscal third quarter.\nSummary Financial Information\nThe Company's summarized financial information is as follows:\nFor the quarter\nended and as of\nNovember 30, 2017\nFor the quarter\nended and as of\nAugust 31, 2017\nFor the quarter\nended and as of\nNovember 30, 2016\n($ in thousands except per share)\nAUM\n338,838\n332,970\n277,570\nNAV\n138,846\n133,460\n127,680\nNAV per share\n22.58\n22.37\n22.21\nInvestment Income\n9,526\n10,254\n8,442\nNet Investment Income per share\n0.50\n0.49\n0.60\nAdjusted Net Investment Income per share\n0.54\n0.62\n0.53\nEarnings per share\n0.71\n1.15\n0.27\nReturn on Equity – last twelve months\n10.2%\n8.3%\n7.7%\n– annualized quarter\n12.9%\n21.1%\n4.9%\n\"During the fiscal third quarter of 2018, we continued to build on our core objectives of growing the size and improving the quality of our asset base by utilizing our highly effective originations team, and flexible and well-structured capital sources,\" said Christian L. Oberbeck, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Saratoga Investment. \"Despite the competitive and challenging environment, our new deal pipeline remains robust and our credit quality is high. The strength and solidity of our performance is reflected in our performance metrics: - adjusted NII per share is $0.54, five cents above our current $0.49 dividend; adjusted NII Yield is 9.6%; LTM ROE is 10.2%, almost 200 basis points above the BDC industry mean; and NAV per share is $22.58, up $0.61 from year-end. NAV increased again to $138.8 million, representing a 61% increase over the past 7 years. We increased our dividend for the thirteenth consecutive quarter, announcing a $0.01 increase to $0.49 per share, and continue to out-earn our dividend payments, a differentiator for us in the marketplace. We also remain well-structured for the current rising interest rate environment, with 84% of our investments having floating-rate interest rates and through their floors, and all of our debt, except for our revolving credit facility, being fixed-rate.\"\nMichael J. Grisius, President and Chief Investment Officer, added, \"This fiscal quarter has demonstrated both the continued attractiveness of our financial offerings and our relentless focus on credit quality, a combination that has allowed us to navigate a difficult sourcing environment and maintain high credit quality. As we always emphasize, quarterly originations can be lumpy and repayments unpredictable, but we remain confident that we can continue to grow our AUM steadily over the long-term, as demonstrated again this year with our 16% growth since year-end. We also continue to keep over 97% of our credits in our highest ratings category. We believe successful investing rests on sound judgment and steady, continuous discipline, taken one decision at a time.\"\nAs of November 30, 2017, Saratoga Investment increased its assets under management (\"AUM\") to $338.8 million, an increase of 1.8% from $333.0 million as of August 31, 2017, an increase of 15.8% from $292.7 million as of February 28, 2017, and an increase of 22.1% from $277.6 million as of November 30, 2016. The increase this quarter reflects originations of $5.2 million, offset by repayments and amortizations of $1.8 million. Including realized and unrealized gains, Saratoga Investment's portfolio has continued to grow this quarter and remains strong, with a continued high level of investment quality in loan investments, with 97.2% of our loans this quarter at our highest internal rating.\nFor the three months ended November 30, 2017, total investment income of $9.5 million increased $1.1 million, or 12.8%, compared to $8.4 million for the three months ended November 30, 2016. This increased investment income was generated from an investment base that has grown significantly by 22.1% in total investments to $338.8 million at November 30, 2017 from $277.6 million at November 30, 2016, with the weighted average current coupon increasing from 10.8% to 11.3%. This increase was offset by other income reducing from $0.6 million last year to $0.05 million this year, reflecting the lower levels of originations this quarter. In addition, this quarter's investment income was also 7.1% down from $10.3 million for the quarter ended August 31, 2017, primarily reflecting (i) the announced downsizing of our Easy Ice, LLC investment by $10.2 million that was fully outstanding for the three months ended August 31, 2017, and (ii) the reduced other income discussed above.\nAs compared to the three months ended November 30, 2016, the investment income increase of $1.1 million was offset by (i) increased debt and financing expenses from higher outstanding Notes payable, revolving debt outstanding with Madison Capital Funding and SBA debentures this quarter, reflective of the growing investment and asset base, (ii) increased base management fees generated from the management of this larger pool of investments and (iii) increased total expenses, excluding interest and debt financing expenses, base management fees and incentive fees, reflecting primarily higher professional fees due to increased Sarbanes-Oxley (\"SOX\") activities now that the Company qualifies as an accelerated filer next year.\nNet investment income on a weighted average per share basis was $0.50 for the quarter ended November 30, 2017. Adjusted for the incentive fee accrual related to net unrealized capital gains, the net investment income on a weighted average per share basis was $0.54. This compares to adjusted net investment income per share of $0.62 for the quarter ended August 31, 2017 and $0.53 for the quarter ended November 30, 2016, reflecting a decrease of 12.9% and an increase of 1.9%, respectively.\nNet investment income yield as percentage of average net asset value (\"Net Investment Income Yield\") was 8.9% for the quarter ended November 30, 2017. Adjusted for the incentive fee accrual related to net unrealized capital gains, the Net Investment Income Yield was 9.6%. In comparison, Net Investment Income Yield was 8.9% and 10.7% for the quarters ended August 31, 2017 and November 30, 2016, respectively. Adjusted Net Investment Income Yield was 11.3% and 9.5% for the same quarters, respectively.\nNet Asset Value (\"NAV\") was $138.8 million as of November 30, 2017, an increase of $5.3 million from $133.5 million as of August 31, 2017, and an increase of $11.5 million from $127.3 million as of February 28, 2017.\nFor the nine months ended November 30, 2017, $2.7 million of net realized and unrealized gains and $9.4 million of net investment income were earned, partially offset by $8.3 million of dividends declared. In addition, $1.8 million of stock dividend distributions were made through the Company's dividend reinvestment plan (\"DRIP\") and $6.0 million of shares were sold through the Company's At-the-Market (\"ATM\") equity offering.\nNAV per share was $22.58 as of November 30, 2017, compared to $22.37 as of August 31, 2017 and $21.97 as of February 28, 2017.\nFor the nine months ended November 30, 2017, NAV per share increased by $0.61 per share, primarily reflecting the $3.8 million, or $0.62 per share increase in net assets (net of the $1.41 dividend paid during the first nine months of fiscal year 2018", "external_links": ["http://ir.saratogainvestmentcorp.com/events.cfm", "http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/saratoga-investment-corp-announces-fiscal-third-quarter-2018-financial-results-300581072.html"], "published": "2018-01-11T00:23:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-11T01:33:01.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
