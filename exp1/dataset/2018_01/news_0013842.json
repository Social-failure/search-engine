REUTERS/Clara Margais NO RESALES. NO ARCHIVES A regional court in Berlin backed Fairplane’s position this week and said it would reverse the opening of insolvency proceedings in Berlin. Niki has filed an appeal against the ruling with Germany’s supreme court, which said on Tuesday it would handle the case “swiftly”.\nNiki’s founder, former Formula One world champion Niki Lauda, said on Oe24 TV he stood ready, if given the chance, to offer a fresh bid for the airline together with Thomas Cook ( TCG.L ) and Condor, after missing out to IAG last month.\n“I continue to be interested but the question does not currently arise... The legal situation is not clear,” Lauda said, adding he had previously offered around 36 million euros.\nMeanwhile Niki is burning through up to 16.5 million euros ($19.7 million) of interim financing it has been given by IAG’s Vueling, which administrator Floether said would last for only a few weeks.\nIAG declined to comment on Tuesday.\n($1 = 0.8384 euros)\nAdditional reporting by Ursula Knapp, Shadia Nasralla and Alistair Smout; Editing by Mark Potter, Adrian Croft and Jane Merriman\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-01-10T04:55:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-10T02:56:55.022+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
