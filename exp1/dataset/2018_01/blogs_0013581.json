Trump would earn just 38 percent of the vote. A relatively significant 14 percent of the respondents were undecided, however. \nWinfrey enjoys more support among Democrats than Trump does from Republicans: 76 percent of Democrats said they support Winfrey, compared with 66 percent of Republicans who support Trump. \nThe national political conversation turned to Winfrey after she gave a rousing and decidedly political speech at the 75th annual Golden Globe awards on Sunday night. Shortly after, reports surfaced that Winfrey was \"actively thinking\" about running for president in 2020. She has repeatedly knocked down suggestions that she might run. Her close friend, \"CBS This Morning\" host Gayle King, said Tuesday that Winfrey was \"intrigued\" by the idea of running, but likely hadn't changed her mind.
