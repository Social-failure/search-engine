It is set for late 2018 and will include a local listing, sources say. \nJohn Tuttle, who is in charge of global listings at the NYSE, said the exchange would not need to water down its stricter disclosure requirements to land such a huge IPO. \n“You don’t see the United States bending over backwards to accommodate any specific company like you see in other jurisdictions,” he told Reuters in an interview on the sidelines of the World Economic Forum in Davos. \nThe London stock exchange declined to comment on Tuttle’s remarks and pointed Reuters to exchange data showing that nine out of its top 10 listings were by international companies and that North American firms accounted for 20 listings last year. \nNYSE rules on minimum free floats are much less stringent than those in the UK. Tuttle said the New York exchange only required a global market capitalization of 200 million dollars and a float of more than 40 million dollars. \n“So that’s not a problem for many companies,” he said.

Passed last year, the law allows the Saudi government to be sued on the grounds it helped plan the Sept. 11, 2001 attacks on the United States. Riyadh denies the allegation.

I assume they have the smartest bankers and lawyers and advisers working on the transaction who will give them the best advice with regards to where they ultimately want to be listed, if it’s one or multiple jurisdictions and exchanges.” \nCiting BP, Total and Petrobras as examples of other major foreign energy companies which listed in New York, he said: “Many of these national energy champions trade more volume in the United States than they do on their local exchanges.” \nEarlier on Tuesday, Russia’s top state investment officer told Reuters in Davos that Russian pension funds were considering investing in Aramco’s IPO in a move to strengthen a partnership between the world’s two top oil producers.
