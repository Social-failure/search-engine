(NYSE: ARE) announced today the closing of its previously announced underwritten public offering of 6,900,000 shares of the Company's common stock at a public offering price of $123.50 per share, including the 900,000 shares sold pursuant to the exercise in full of the underwriters' option to purchase additional shares of the Company's common stock. In connection with the offering, the Company entered into forward sale agreements between the Company and each of Bank of America, N.A., JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., London Branch, and Citibank, N.A. (together, the \"forward purchasers\").\nBofA Merrill Lynch, J.P. Morgan and Citigroup acted as the joint book-running managers for the offering. Evercore ISI, Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC, Mizuho Securities, RBC Capital Markets, Scotiabank, Wells Fargo Securities, Barclays, BB&T Capital Markets, BNP PARIBAS, BTIG, Capital One Securities, Fifth Third Securities, JMP Securities, Loop Capital Markets, PNC Capital Markets LLC, Ramirez & Co., Inc., SMBC Nikko, SunTrust Robinson Humphrey and TD Securities acted as co-managers for the offering.\nThe Company will not initially receive any proceeds from the sale of shares of its common stock by the forward purchasers (or their affiliates) in the offering. The Company expects to use the net proceeds, if any, it receives upon the future settlement of the forward sale agreements to fund pending acquisitions that the Company expects to complete in the near term and the construction of ongoing, highly leased development projects, with any remaining proceeds to be held for general working capital and other corporate purposes, including the reduction of the outstanding balance, if any, on the Company's unsecured senior line of credit. Selling common stock through the forward sale agreements enables the Company to set the price of such shares upon the pricing of the offering (subject to certain adjustments) while delaying the issuance of such shares and the receipt of the net proceeds by the Company until the expected funding requirements described above have occurred.\nThis press release does not constitute an offer to sell or a solicitation of an offer to buy any of the Company's securities, nor shall there be any sale of these securities in any state in which such offer, solicitation or sale would be unlawful prior to registration or qualification under the securities laws of any such state.\nAlexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc.\nAlexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc.
