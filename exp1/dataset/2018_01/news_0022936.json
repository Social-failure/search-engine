Morales has denied the accusations.\nWorking with the attorney general’s office, the International Commission against Impunity in Guatemala (CICIG) attempted to strip Morales of his immunity in September, but fell short of the required two-thirds majority in Congress.\nReporting by Sofia Menchu; Editing by Lisa Shumaker\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-17T04:40:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-17T04:56:03.006+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
