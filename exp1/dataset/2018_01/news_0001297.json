Choo said he had been unable to speak to his client and had filed a court application to compel immigration authorities to give him access. \nVictor Pfaff, a lawyer representing Vu in Frankfurt, confirmed he had written to the German embassy in Singapore about the case on Dec. 31. The German foreign office did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
