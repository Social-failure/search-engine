Authorities have blocked his attempts to meet Wang. \nWang, who has been detained for over 900 days, has been charged with subversion of state power. Wang’s wife, who has protested on her husband’s behalf, had asked Yu to defend him after rejecting court-appointed lawyers. \nYu’s wife Xu Yan said in a statement sent to Reuters that she and Yu had spent over 150,000 yuan attempting to set up an independent legal practice for Yu after he left his old firm last year. \n“Now, the Beijing justice bureau says its not going to happen, so it’s not going to happen,” she said.
