Jason’s decision was not related to the business strategy or performance of Ford China,” Fleet said, adding that Luo’s replacement would be the subject of a future announcement.\nThe departure, effective immediately, is a blow to Ford, which has been falling behind rivals in the market. Its China sales slid 6 percent in 2017 compared with a 3 percent rise for the industry overall.\nLuo was meant to help the firm improve ties with local joint-venture partners like Chongqing Changan Automobile Co and be nimbler in responding to local consumer demands.\nAt Ford, Luo was in charge of the carmaker’s operations in Greater China including its import business, Lincoln, its passenger car joint venture Changan Ford, its commercial vehicle investment in Jiangling Motors Corporation, and its Taiwan operations.\nForeign automakers in China are also battling fierce competition from local rivals, who are aggressively launching new models to grab market share. The market is also skewed by heavy government support for electric vehicles, prompting Ford and others to seek partners and expand local production.\nReporting by Norihiko Shirouzu; Additional reporting by Adam Jourdan in SHANGHAI; Editing by Jacqueline Wong and Edwina Gibbs\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-29T07:09:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-29T07:24:58.017+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
