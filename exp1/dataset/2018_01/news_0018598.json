However, Brunel insisted that the team needed to focus on short term objectives rather than obsess over the Webb Ellis Cup. \n“Let’s not think too much about the World Cup for now, there are steps to climb before that,” he said. \nA decent showing in the Six Nations will require a high level of fitness from the players, Brunel added. \n“High-level rugby is about intensity and speed and that’s what we need to concentrate on,” he said. \nLes Bleus are in need of a significant confidence boost, having lost five of their last six matches, with no wins coming in their four international matches last November. \n“We must restore the players’ confidence,” said assistant coach Jean-Baptiste Elissalde. \n“We will try to work on the basics with the little time we have ahead of us and insist on the players’ forte.” (Reporting by Julien Pretot; Editing by Christian Radnedge)", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-08T17:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-08T17:23:40.024+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
