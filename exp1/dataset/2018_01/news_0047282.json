Forward-looking statements can be identified by the use of words such as “may,” “will,” “should,” “could,” “believe,” “anticipate,” “expect,” “estimate,” “plan” or other comparable terminology.

Future events and actual results may differ materially from those discussed in the forward-looking statements.\nImportant factors that may affect these expectations, estimates, and projections include, but are not limited to:\ngeneral economic and business conditions, which will, among other things, affect office property and data center demand and rents, tenant creditworthiness, interest rates, financing availability and property values; adverse changes in the real estate markets including, among other things, increased competition with other companies; governmental actions and initiatives, including risks associated with the impact of a prolonged government shutdown or budgetary reductions or impasses, such as a reduction in rental revenues, non-renewal of leases, and/or a curtailment of demand for additional space by the Company's strategic customers; the Company’s ability to borrow on favorable terms; risks of real estate acquisition and development activities, including, among other things, risks that development projects may not be completed on schedule, that tenants may not take occupancy or pay rent or that development or operating costs may be greater than anticipated; risks of investing through joint venture structures, including risks that the Company’s joint venture partners may not fulfill their financial obligations as investors or may take actions that are inconsistent with the Company’s objectives; changes in the Company’s plans for properties or views of market economic conditions or failure to obtain development rights, either of which could result in recognition of significant impairment losses; the Company’s ability to satisfy and operate effectively under Federal income tax rules relating to real estate investment trusts and partnerships; the Company's ability to achieve projected results; the dilutive effects of issuing additional common shares; and environmental requirements.\nThe Company undertakes no obligation to update or supplement any forward-looking statements.
