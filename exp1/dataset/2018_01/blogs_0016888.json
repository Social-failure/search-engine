At the end of 2017, the feature began enrolling users who wanted to look at their bills into the credit scoring system, Sesame Credit.\nThat allowed Sesame Credit to collect their data and share the analysis with its partners. Users could only opt out if they unchecked a button on the feature’s landing page.\nSesame Credit apologized last week and canceled the default option.\n“We immediately initiated a comprehensive review of our privacy protection policy across the business,” Ant Financial chief privacy officer Nie Zhengjun said in a statement on Thursday.\nAnt Financial’s board of directors will be responsible for overseeing all privacy-related matters going forward, Nie said.\nCAC said the company should “step up efforts to conduct a comprehensive investigation of the Alipay platform, carry out special rectifications and take effective measures to prevent similar incidents from recurring.”\nIt Quote: d Alipay and Sesame Credit as saying that they had learned a “profound lesson” from the incident.\nReporting by Brenda Goh; Editing by Edwina Gibbs and Richard Pullin\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-11T03:56:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-11T04:11:01.050+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
