SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY Slideshow (2 Images) \nIG Metall is not the only German labor union demanding a big pay hike following a strong year of growth in Europe’s largest economy helped by domestic demand from record numbers of German workers. \nChemicals and mining workers union IG BCE said it was time for a redistribution of robust profits. \n“When even (chemicals trade body) VCI... says the situation is currently ‘unconditionally good’, then that means that the ladies and gentlemen there are dancing on the tables,” IG BCE President Michael Vassiliadis told journalists late on Tuesday. \nUnion Verdi is demanding a choice between a 6 percent wage increase or more time off for around 130,000 workers at postal and logistics group Deutsche Post ( DPWGn.DE ). \nRail operator Deusche Bahn [DBN.UL] had found last year when it offered a choice between higher pay, shorter hours or more days off that more than half of workers chose to have more days off. \nIndustrial employers have said they cannot make up for lost production if staff shorten their hours because they cannot find skilled workers. They have also rejected the idea that they should help make up for the pay shortfall for some workers who shorten their hours. \nIG Metall has meanwhile made clear that it is drawing a line in the sand regarding the right to shorter working hours, saying employers had a social responsibility to contribute to issues related to health and family. \n“We want (shorter hours) to be possible for everyone, including those at the bottom of the income scale. That is why we need pay to be subsidized, so that children, caring for family and health don’t depend on how much you have in your wallet,” Hofmann said. \nTalks between IG Metall and the regional employers’ association are set for Thursday in the southwestern state of Baden-Wuerttemberg, where Volkswagen’s ( VOWG_p.DE ) Porsche, Mercedes-Benz maker Daimler ( DAIGn.DE ) and automotive suppliers including Bosch [ROBG.UL] are based. \nNext door in Bavaria negotiations will resume on Jan. 15, and to the north in North Rhine-Westphalia on Jan. 18. \n($1 = 0.8377 euros) Reporting by Maria Sheahan; Additional reporting by Matthias Inverardi, Ilona Wissenbach and Jan Schwartz; Editing by Ludwig Burger, Jeremy Gaunt and Peter Graff", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-10T11:56:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-10T12:11:57.018+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
