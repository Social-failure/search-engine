They did not elaborate.\nOfficials did not respond to requests for comment on Ibrahim’s case on Monday.\nReporting by Reem Shamseddine; Writing by Andrew Torchia; Editing by Toby Chopra, William Maclean\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-01-29T17:31:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-29T11:42:57.001+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
