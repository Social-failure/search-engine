Thanh faces a life sentence over allegations of misconduct and embezzlement. \n“The lawyers have said clearly that the evidence was fuzzy and conflicting,” the Phap Luat newspaper quoted Thanh as saying in reference to the charges. \nGermany says Thanh was seeking asylum there but was forcibly repatriated by Vietnam last August. Germany expelled two diplomats over the incident, but Vietnam says police arrested Thanh after he turned himself in voluntarily. \nIn his final statement, Thanh thanked prison officials for helping him gain the weight he lost at the start of his detention. \nIn a separate case linked to the crackdown on fraud and mismanagement, a fugitive Vietnamese tycoon Phan Van Anh Vu, 42, was arrested in Hanoi this month after being deported from Singapore. Vu, who was also trying to get to Germany, told his lawyers he worked for Vietnamese intelligence.
