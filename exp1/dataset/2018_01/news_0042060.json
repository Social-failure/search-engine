(NYSE: LUV) (the \"Company\") today reported its fourth quarter and annual 2017 results:\nRecord fourth quarter net income and earnings per diluted share of $1.9 billion and $3.18, respectively Excluding special items 1 , fourth quarter net income of $459 million, or $.77 per diluted share Record annual net income and earnings per diluted share of $3.5 billion and $5.79, respectively Excluding special items 1 , annual net income of $2.1 billion, or $3.50 per diluted share Annual operating income of $3.5 billion, resulting in an operating margin 2 of 16.6 percent, or 16.3 percent, excluding special items 3 Annual operating cash flow of $3.9 billion, and annual free cash flow 1 of $1.8 billion Returned approximately $1.9 billion to Shareholders through a combination of $274 million in dividends and $1.6 billion in share repurchases Annual return on invested capital (ROIC) 1 of 25.9 percent\nGary C. Kelly, Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer, stated, \"Our strong fourth quarter earnings performance capped another year of extraordinary achievements, including 45 straight years of profitability. Last week, for the 24th consecutive year, Southwest was named to FORTUNE's 2018 list of World's Most Admired Companies. I want to thank our People for their exceptional results and congratulate them on this outstanding honor.\n\"Our strong profits, cash flow, and financial position enabled us to deploy capital wisely and sustain high returns on invested capital. We made significant progress modernizing our fleet, investing in technology and facilities, and returning value in excess of our free cash flow 1 to Shareholders. We celebrated several notable milestones during 2017, including the implementation of our new reservation system; the retirement of our Boeing 737-300 Classic fleet; the launch of the new Boeing 737 MAX 8; the launch of service to Cincinnati, Grand Cayman, and Turks & Caicos; and the announcement of our commitment to serve Hawaii. Our Employees delivered another outstanding year of operational Reliability and Hospitality, including the best baggage delivery rates in our history. These achievements are significant, especially considering the backdrop of unprecedented natural disasters and the competitive industry environment. As ever, the Warrior Spirits and fortitude of our People resulted in an outstanding overall 2017 performance, which earned them $543 million in profitsharing during 2017.\n\"We applaud Congress and the President for the tax reform legislation passed on December 22, 2017. We celebrated the passage of tax reform with our Employees through a $1,000 per person cash bonus paid on January 8, 2018. We also announced an incremental donation to charitable causes and an additional investment in our fleet to support future growth opportunities and fleet modernization. The tax reform is very meaningful to Southwest Airlines, reducing our 2017 deferred tax liability by $1.4 billion. Based on our current outlook, the reduction in the statutory federal rate will result in hundreds of millions in tax savings, which will significantly boost our earnings in 2018.\n\"As we look to realize ongoing benefits of modernizing our fleet and optimizing our route network, we are enthusiastic about our ability to leverage our strengths and scale to meet Customer demand. We are pleased with the progress made thus far to obtain authorization from the Federal Aviation Administration for Extended Operations (ETOPS) to operate between the mainland and the Hawaiian Islands later this year. In addition, as a complement to our more than forty flights a day to 15 cities nonstop from Seattle-Tacoma International Airport, today we announce our commitment to launch up to five daily flights 4 at a new commercial aircraft facility at Paine Field in Everett, Washington, scheduled to be completed later this year.\n\"We begin 2018 focused on our goal to expand margins and profits, excluding special items 1 . Our balance sheet and liquidity remain strong, with manageable debt service and capital spending this year. Our 2018 growth plans effectively replace Classics retired last year and further strengthen our robust route network. Based on the current outlook and our commercial initiatives and objectives, our goal remains to achieve positive unit revenue growth in 2018, year-over-year. We continue to expect our new reservation system to produce incremental improvements in pre-tax results of approximately $200 million in 2018, primarily from enhanced revenue management capabilities. We remain focused on improving our productivity and reliability and reducing our year-over-year operating costs per available seat mile, excluding fuel and oil expense, profitsharing expense, and special items 1 , in 2018. Overall, our strong financial performance, solid outlook, healthy balance sheet, and significantly lower federal income taxes, provide the cash flow to continue to reward our Employees, keep our costs and fares low for our Customers, reinvest in our business, return value to our Shareholders, and support our communities.\"\nNotable 2017 accomplishments for the Company include:\nAchieved 45th consecutive year of profitability Employees earned $543 million in profitsharing Strengthened its investment-grade credit rating with an upgrade to A3 with Moody's Investors Service and an upgrade to BBB+ with Standard & Poor's Deployed the largest technology initiative in its history with the achievement of a new reservation system Completed the early retirement of the remaining Boeing 737-300 Classic aircraft Introduced the Boeing 737 MAX 8 into its fleet Revised its Boeing delivery schedule to support future growth opportunities and continued fleet modernization Opened the newly revitalized and enhanced Terminal 1 at Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport to support expanded international flying from South Florida Consolidated its Ohio operations and launched service at Cincinnati/Northern Kentucky International Airport Launched service to Grand Cayman and Turks & Caicos Islands, ending the year with service to 14 international destinations in 10 countries Launched international service from Oakland International Airport, San Diego International Airport, Nashville International Airport, and St. Louis Lambert International Airport, ending the year with 16 international gateway airports from the 48 contiguous states Announced plans to begin selling tickets in 2018 for service to Hawaii Ratified a collective bargaining agreement with the Facilities Maintenance Technicians Received numerous awards and recognitions, including being ranked #1 in the U.S. Department of Transportation Customer Satisfaction ranking for 2016; named Domestic Carrier of the Year by the Airforwarders Association for the 8th consecutive year; ranked the highest Low-Cost Carrier in the J.D. Power 2017 North America Airline Satisfaction Study; named one of Corporate Responsibility's 100 Best Corporate Citizens 2017; recognized by Express Delivery and Logistics Association with the 2016 Express Cargo Standard of Excellence award; received Readers' Pick for Best Frequent Flyer Program (U.S.) for its Rapid RewardsÂ® Program by SmarterTravel; ranked among the Best Airline Rewards Programs by U.S. News & World Report; named one of Glassdoor's Best Places to Work for the 9th consecutive year; named Program of the Year for its Rapid Rewards Program and recognized for providing the Best Loyalty Credit Card, the Best Airline Redemption Ability, and for the 5th consecutive year, the Best Customer Service by the Freddie Awards; and designated as a 2017 Most Valuable Employer for military by Recruit Military, as well as a Best Employer in Forbes' 2017 list\nRevenue Results and Outlook\nThe Company's fourth quarter 2017 total operating revenues were a fourth quarter record $5.3 billion, driven largely by record fourth quarter passenger revenues of $4.7 billion. As compared with fourth quarter 2016, total operating revenues increased 3.9 percent on a 2.0 percent increase in available seat miles, resulting in a 1.9 percent increase in operating unit revenues (RASM). Strong passenger demand resulted in a fourth quarter record 85.0 percent load factor, while fourth quarter passenger revenue yield decreased 0.1 percent, year-over-year. Passenger bookings and revenues for first quarter 2018, thus far, are solid. Based on these trends and the current outlook, the Company expects first quarter 2018 RASM to increase in the one to two percent range, as compared with first quarter 2017.\nBeginning January 1, 2018, the Company expects to adopt Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, and plans to utilize the full retrospective method of adoption allowed by the standard. The Company is in the process of completing its analysis of information necessary to recast prior period results, in order to provide comparative results in all periods presented. As such, the Company's current forward-looking guidance for 2018 revenue trends excludes any impact associated with the adoption of ASU No. 2014-09.\nAnnual 2017 total operating revenues increased 3.7 percent, year-over-year, to a record $21.2 billion due to strong passenger demand for low fares, resulting in a 0.1 percent increase in RASM.\nCost Performance and Outlook\nFourth quarter 2017 total operating expenses increased 6.4 percent to $4.5 billion, and increased 4.3 percent on a unit basis, as compared with fourth quarter 2016. Excluding special items 1 in both periods, which primarily related to the Company's fuel hedge derivative contracts, fourth quarter 2017 total operating expenses increased 5.1 percent to $4.5 billion, and increased 3.0 percent on a unit basis, year-over-year.\nFourth quarter 2017 economic fuel costs 1 were $2.09 per gallon, including $.19 per gallon in unfavorable cash settlements from fuel derivative contracts, compared with $2.07 per gallon in fourth quarter 2016, including $.50 per gallon in unfavorable cash settlements from fuel derivative contracts. Annual 2017 economic fuel costs 1 of $2.00 per gallon increased 4.2 percent, as compared with 2016.\nBeginning January 1, 2018, in accordance with the Company's planned early adoption of ASU No. 2017-12, Targeting Improvements to Accounting for Hedging Activities, the Company will report fuel hedging premium expense within Fuel and oil expense rather than within Other (gains) and losses, net, on the Income Statement. Based on the Company's existing fuel derivative contracts and market prices as of January 19, 2018, first quarter 2018 economic fuel costs 1 are estimated to be in the $2.10 to $2.15 per gallon range 5 . This compares with both first quarter 2017's economic fuel cost 1 of $2.03 per gallon, which will be recast from $1.96 per gallon, as reported, and fourth quarter 2017's economic fuel cost 1 of $2.16 per gallon, which will be recast from $2.09 per gallon, as reported. Fuel hedging premium expense of approximately $34 million, or $.07 per gallon, is included in the first quarter 2018 estimated guidance range and also in the recast per-gallon prices for first and fourth quarters, 2017.\nThe Company's annual 2018 economic fuel costs 1 are currently estimated to be in the $2.10 to $2.15 per gallon range 5 , which is an approximate two percent increase from 2017's annual economic fuel costs 1 per gallon, including approximately $135 million, or $.06 per gallon, of fuel hedging premium expense in both years. The Company estimates an improvement in 2018 available seat miles per gallon, or fuel efficiency, in the two to three percent range, year-over-year, driven primarily by the retirement of the Boeing 737-300 Classic aircraft and the addition of the more fuel-efficient Boeing 737 MAX 8 aircraft.\nAs of January 19, 2018, the fair market value of the Company's fuel derivative contracts settling in first quarter 2018 was a net asset of approximately $31 million, and a net asset of approximately $102 million for those settling over the remainder of 2018. In addition, the fair market value of the hedge portfolio settling in 2019 and beyond was a net asset of approximately $169 million. Additional information regarding the Company's fuel derivative contracts is included in the accompanying tables.\nExcluding fuel and oil expense and special items 1 in both periods, fourth quarter 2017 operating expenses increased 6.2 percent, as compared with fourth quarter 2016. Fourth quarter 2017 profitsharing expense was $115 million, compared with $123 million in fourth quarter 2016. Excluding fuel and oil expense, profitsharing expense, and special items 1 , fourth quarter 2017 operating expenses increased 6.7 percent, and increased 4.6 percent on a unit basis, both year-over-year. These increases were driven primarily by increases in salaries, wages, and benefits including the tax reform Employee bonus of approximately $70 million, a litigation settlement, a shift in advertising spend from third quarter 2017, incremental costs associated with technology investments including ETOPS authorization in preparation for Hawaii, and an incremental charitable contribution following the passage of tax reform. Based on current cost trends, first quarter 2018 unit costs, excluding fuel and oil expense, profitsharing expense, and special items 1 , are estimated to increase in the range of 0.5 to 1.5 percent 6 , year-over-year.\nAnnual 2017 total operating expenses increased 5.9 percent to $17.7 billion, and increased 2.3 percent on a unit basis, year-over-year. Excluding fuel and oil expense, profitsharing expense, and special items 1 , annual 2017 total operating expenses increased 8.7 percent, and increased 4.9 percent on a unit basis, both year-over-year, primarily due to increases in salaries, wages, and benefits, and airport landing fees and rentals. Based on current cost trends, annual 2018 unit costs, excluding fuel and oil expense, profitsharing expense, and special items 1 , are estimated to be in the range of flat to down one percent 6 , year-over-year.\nFourth Quarter and Annual Results\nFourth quarter 2017 operating income was $773 million, compared with $846 million in fourth quarter 2016. Excluding special items 1 , fourth quarter 2017 operating income was $746 million, compared with $768 million in fourth quarter 2016.\nOther expenses in fourth quarter 2017 were $36 million, compared with $37 million in fourth quarter 2016, which included other losses recognized of $28 million and $26 million, respectively. In both periods, these losses included ineffectiveness and unrealized mark-to-market amounts associated with a portion of the Company's fuel hedge portfolio, which are treated as special items. Excluding these special items 1 , fourth quarter 2017 had $31 million in other losses, compared with $43 million in fourth quarter 2016, primarily attributable to fuel hedging premium expenses associated with the Company's fuel derivative contracts. Net interest expense in fourth quarter 2017 was $8 million, compared with $11 million in fourth quarter 2016.\nFourth quarter 2017 net income was a quarterly record $1.9 billion, or a quarterly record $3.18 per diluted share, compared with fourth quarter 2016 net income of $522 million, or $.84 per diluted share. Fourth quarter 2017 net income was positively impacted by a $1.4 billion tax benefit due to tax reform legislation, which was recorded as a result of the difference in tax rates in effect when income tax expense was accrued, as compared with the rates expected to be in effect when the income taxes will be paid. This non-cash tax benefit effectively reduces the Company's deferred tax liability on its Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2017. Excluding this and other special items 1 , fourth quarter 2017 net income was $459 million, or $.77 per diluted share, compared with fourth quarter 2016 net income of $463 million, or $.75 per diluted share, and the First Call fourth quarter 2017 consensus estimate of $.76 per diluted share.\nAnnual 2017 operating income was $3.5 billion, compared with $3.8 billion in 2016. Excluding special items 1 , annual 2017 operating income was $3.5 billion, compared with $4.0 billion in 2016. Annual 2017 net income was a record $3.5 billion, or a record $5.79 per diluted share, compared with annual 2016 net income of $2.2 billion, or $3.55 per diluted share. Excluding special items 1 , annual 2017 net income was $2.1 billion, or $3.50 per diluted share, compared with $2.4 billion, or $3.75 per diluted share in 2016. The Company's annual 2017 effective tax rate was (7.3) percent. Excluding the impact of the fourth quarter 2017 $1.4 billion tax benefit due to tax reform legislation, and other special items 1 , annual 2017 effective tax rate was approximately 36 percent. For full year 2018, the Company estimates its effective tax rate to be in the 23 to 23.5 percent range, as a result of a lower corporate tax rate, and including the estimated impact of state taxes.\nLiquidity and Capital Deployment\nAs of December 31, 2017, the Company had approximately $3.3 billion in cash and short-term investments, and a fully available unsecured revolving credit line of $1 billion. For 2017, net cash provided by operations was $3.9 billion, and capital expenditures were $2.1 billion, resulting in free cash flow 1 of $1.8 billion. Annual 2017 capital expenditures were lower than expected primarily due to approximately $115 million of capital investments that shifted from 2017 into 2018. The Company currently estimates its 2018 capital expenditures will be approximately $1.9 billion. The Company repaid $592 million in debt and capital lease obligations during 2017, and is currently scheduled to repay approximately $337 million in debt and capital lease obligations during 2018. During fourth quarter 2017, the Company issued $300 million of unsecured notes due in 2022 and $300 million of unsecured notes due in 2027.\nIn 2017, the Company returned approximately $1.9 billion to its Shareholders through the payment of $274 million in dividends and the repurchase of approximately 26.7 million shares of common stock for $1.6 billion. During fourth quarter 2017, the Company returned $350 million to its Shareholders through the repurchase of common stock. The Company repurchased $250 million in common stock pursuant to an Accelerated Share Repurchase (ASR) program launched during fourth quarter 2017 and received approximately 3.32 million shares, representing an estimated 75 percent of the shares expected to be repurchased under that ASR program. Additionally, the Company repurchased approximately 1.63 million shares during fourth quarter 2017 through $100 million in open market transactions. During fourth quarter 2017, the Company also received approximately 1.21 million shares, which remained pursuant to a $300 million third quarter 2017 ASR program. The Company has $1.35 billion remaining under its May 2017 share repurchase authorization.\nFleet and Capacity\nThe Company ended 2017 with 706 aircraft in its fleet. This reflects the delivery of 39 new Boeing 737-800 aircraft, 13 new Boeing 737 MAX 8 aircraft, and 18 pre-owned Boeing 737-700 aircraft, as well as the retirement of 87 Boeing 737-300 Classic aircraft during the year. In December 2017, the Company revised its future firm order delivery schedule with Boeing to support future growth opportunities and fleet modernization, at favorable economics. The Company exercised 40 737 MAX 8 options for 15 firm orders in 2019 and 25 firm orders in 2020. The Company deferred 23 737 MAX 7 firm orders from 2019 through 2021 to 12 firm orders in 2023 and 11 firm orders in 2024. The Company also accelerated 23 737 MAX 8 firm orders from 2023 to 2024 to an additional 21 firm orders in 2021 and 2 firm orders in 2022. For 2018, the Company continues to expect to end the year with 750 aircraft in its fleet based on the current aircraft delivery schedule. Additional information regarding the Company's aircraft delivery schedule is included in the accompanying tables.\nThe Company increased its available seat miles by 3.6 percent in 2017, as compared with 2016. The Company expects its 2018 available seat mile year-over-year growth to be in the low five percent range, with first half 2018 year-over-year growth in the low three percent range and second half 2018 year-over-year growth in the low seven percent range. The second half 2018 year-over-year growth rate is significantly impacted by the 2017 retirement of Boeing 737-300 Classic aircraft and the approximately 5,000 flight cancellations due to natural disasters in third quarter 2017.\nConference Call\nThe Company will discuss its fourth quarter and annual 2017 results on a conference call at 12:30 p.m. Eastern Time today. To listen to a live broadcast of the conference call please go to www.southwestairlinesinvestorrelations.com .\n1 See Note Regarding Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures for additional information on special items, ROIC, and free cash flow. In addition, information regarding special items, ROIC, and economic results is included in the accompanying reconciliation tables.\n2 Operating margin is calculated as operating income divided by operating revenues.\n3 Operating margin, excluding special items, is calculated as operating income, excluding special items, divided by operating revenues. See Note Regarding Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures. In addition, information regarding special items is included in the accompanying reconciliation tables.\n4 Pending requisite approvals of governmental and regulatory agencies.\n5 Economic fuel cost projections do not reflect the potential impact of special items because the Company cannot reliably predict or estimate the hedge accounting impact associated with the volatility of the energy markets or the impact to its financial statements in future periods. Accordingly, the Company believes a reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures to the equivalent GAAP financial measures for projected results is not meaningful or available without unreasonable effort.\n6 Year-over-year projections do not reflect the potential impact of fuel and oil expense, profitsharing expense, and special items in both years because the Company cannot reliably predict or estimate those items or expenses or their impact to its financial statements in future periods, especially considering the significant volatility of the Fuel and oil expense line item. Accordingly, the Company believes a reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures to the equivalent GAAP financial measures for projected results is not meaningful or available without unreasonable effort.\nCautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\nThis news release contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.

The Company makes this adjustment to enhance comparability to other entities that have different capital structures by utilizing alternative financing decisions.\n(b) The Adjustment for fuel hedge accounting in the numerator is due to the Company's accounting policy decision to classify fuel hedge accounting premiums below the Operating income line, and thus is adjusting Operating income to reflect such policy decision. The Equity adjustment for hedge accounting in the denominator adjusts for the cumulative impacts, in Accumulated other comprehensive income and Retained earnings, of gains and/or losses associated with hedge accounting related to fuel hedge derivatives that will settle in future periods. The current period impact of these gains and/or losses are reflected in the Net impact from fuel contracts in the numerator.\n(c) Calculated as an average of the five most recent quarter end balances or remaining obligations. The Net present value of aircraft operating leases represents the assumption that all aircraft in the Company's fleet are owned, as it reflects the remaining contractual commitments discounted at the Company's estimated incremental borrowing rate as of the time each individual lease was signed.\nSouthwest Airlines Co.\nCondensed Consolidated Balance Sheet\n(in millions)\n(unaudited)\nASSETS\nCurrent assets:\nDecember 31, 2017\nDecember 31, 2016\nCash and cash equivalents\n$\n1,495\n$\n1,680\nShort-term investments\n1,778\n1,625\nAccounts and other receivables\n662\n546\nInventories of parts and supplies, at cost\n420\n337\nPrepaid expenses and other current assets\n460\n310\nTotal current assets\n4,815\n4,498\nProperty and equipment, at cost:\nFlight equipment\n21,368\n20,275\nGround property and equipment\n4,399\n3,779\nDeposits on flight equipment purchase contracts\n919\n1,190\nAssets constructed for others\n1,543\n1,220\n28,229\n26,464\nLess allowance for depreciation and amortization\n9,690\n9,420\n18,539\n17,044\nGoodwill\n970\n970\nOther assets\n786\n774\n$\n25,110\n$\n23,286\nLIABILITIES AND STOCKHOLDERS' EQUITY\nCurrent liabilities:\nAccounts payable\n$\n1,320\n$\n1,178\nAccrued liabilities\n1,777\n1,985\nAir traffic liability\n3,460\n3,115\nCurrent maturities of long-term debt\n348\n566\nTotal current liabilities\n6,905\n6,844\nLong-term debt less current maturities\n3,320\n2,821\nDeferred income taxes\n2,358\n3,374\nConstruction obligation\n1,390\n1,078\nOther noncurrent liabilities\n707\n728\nStockholders' equity:\nCommon stock\n808\n808\nCapital in excess of par value\n1,451\n1,410\nRetained earnings\n14,621\n11,418\nAccumulated other comprehensive income (loss)\n12\n(323)\nTreasury stock, at cost\n(6,462)\n(4,872)\nTotal stockholders' equity\n10,430\n8,441\n$\n25,110\n$\n23,286\nSouthwest Airlines Co.\nCondensed Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows\n(in millions)\n(unaudited)\nThree months ended\nDecember 31,\nYear ended\nDecember 31,\n2017\n2016\n2017\n2016\nCASH FLOWS FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIES:\nNet income\n$\n1,888\n$\n522\n$\n3,488\n$\n2,244\nAdjustments to reconcile net income to cash provided by (used in)\noperating activities:\nDepreciation and amortization\n279\n318\n1,218\n1,221\nLoss on asset impairment\nâ\nâ\nâ\n21\nAircraft grounding charge\nâ\nâ\n63\nâ\nUnrealized/realized (gain) loss on fuel derivative instruments\n(30)\n(100)\n(50)\n(200)\nDeferred income taxes\n(1,425)\n60\n(1,212)\n455\nChanges in certain assets and liabilities:\nAccounts and other receivables\n(79)\n306\n(102)\n(50)\nOther assets\n1\n(58)\n(262)\n(119)\nAccounts payable and accrued liabilities\n402\n(45)\n246\n226\nAir traffic liability\n(472)\n(561)\n345\n125\nCash collateral received from derivative counterparties\n29\n305\n316\n535\nOther, net\n(31)\n(38)\n(121)\n(165)\nNet cash provided by operating activities\n562\n709\n3,929\n4,293\nCASH FLOWS FROM INVESTING ACTIVITIES:\nCapital expenditures\n(520)\n(674)\n(2,123)\n(2,038)\nAssets constructed for others\n(13)\n(40)\n(126)\n(109)\nPurchases of short-term investments\n(727)\n(718)\n(2,380)\n(2,388)\nProceeds from sales of short-term and other investments\n526\n592\n2,221\n2,263\nNet cash used in investing activities\n(734)\n(840)\n(2,408)\n(2,272)\nCASH FLOWS FROM FINANCING ACTIVITIES:\nProceeds from issuance of long-term debt\n600\n515\n600\n515\nProceeds from Employee stock plans\n8\n6\n29\n29\nReimbursement for assets constructed for others\n13\n40\n126\n107\nPayments of long-term debt and capital lease obligations\n(58)\n(352)\n(592)\n(523)\nPayments of convertible debt\nâ\n(68)\nâ\n(68)\nPayments of cash dividends\nâ\nâ\n(274)\n(222)\nRepayment of construction obligation\n(4)\n(2)\n(10)\n(9)\nRepurchase of common stock\n(350)\n(300)\n(1,600)\n(1,750)\nOther, net\n(2)\n6\n15\n(3)\nNet cash provided by (used in) financing activities\n207\n(155)\n(1,706)\n(1,924)\nNET CHANGE IN CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS\n35\n(286)\n(185)\n97\nCASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS AT BEGINNING OF PERIOD\n1,460\n1,966\n1,680\n1,583\nCASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS AT END OF PERIOD\n$\n1,495\n$\n1,680\n$\n1,495\n$\n1,680\nSouthwest Airlines Co.\nFuel Derivative Contracts\nAs of January 19, 2018\nEstimated fuel hedging\npremium expense per\ngallon (b)\nEstimated economic fuel\nprice per gallon, including\ntaxes and fuel hedging\npremiums (c)(e)\nEstimated fuel hedging\npremium expense per\ngallon (b)\nEstimated economic fuel\nprice per gallon, including\ntaxes and fuel hedging\npremiums (d)(e)\nAverage Brent Crude Oil price\nper barrel\n1Q 2018\nFull Year 2018\n$55\n$0.07\n$1.85 -

First quarter 2018's expected economic fuel cost range of $2.10 to $2.15 per gallon compares with first quarter 2017's economic fuel cost of $1.96 per gallon, as reported, but including fuel hedging premium expense of $34 million, or $.07 per gallon, will be recast as $2.03 per gallon.\n(d) Based on the Company's existing fuel derivative contracts and market prices as of January 19, 2018, annual 2018 economic fuel costs are estimated to be in the $2.10 to $2.15 per gallon range, including fuel hedging premium expense of approximately $135 million, or $.06 per gallon. 2018's annual expected economic fuel cost range of $2.10 to $2.15 per gallon compares with 2017's annual economic fuel costs of $2.00 per gallon, as reported herein, but including fuel hedging premium expense of $135 million, or $.06 per gallon, will be recast as $2.06 per gallon.\n(e) The economic fuel price per gallon sensitivities provided assume the relationship between Brent crude oil and refined products based on market prices as of January 19, 2018. Economic fuel cost projections do not reflect the potential impact of special items because the Company cannot reliably predict or estimate the hedge accounting impact associated with the volatility of the energy markets or the impact to its financial statements in future periods. Accordingly, the Company believes a reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures to the equivalent GAAP financial measures for projected results is not meaningful or available without unreasonable effort.\nSouthwest Airlines Co.\n737 Delivery Schedule\nAs of December 31, 2017\nThe Boeing Company\n-800 Firm\nOrders\nMAX 7 Firm\nOrders\nMAX 8 Firm\nOrders\nMAX 8\nOptions\nAdditional\n-700s\nTotal\n2018\n26\nâ\n14\nâ\n4\n44\n2019\nâ\n7\n15\nâ\nâ\n22\n2020\nâ\nâ\n25\nâ\nâ\n25\n2021\nâ\nâ\n34\nâ\nâ\n34\n2022\nâ\nâ\n17\n14\nâ\n31\n2023\nâ\n12\n22\n23\nâ\n57\n2024\nâ\n11\n30\n23\nâ\n64\n2025\nâ\nâ\n40\n36\nâ\n76\n2026\nâ\nâ\nâ\n36\nâ\n36\n2027\nâ\nâ\nâ\n23\nâ\n23\n26\n30\n197\n(a)\n155\n4\n(b)\n412\n(a) The Company has flexibility to substitute 737 MAX 7 in lieu of 737 MAX 8 firm orders beginning in 2019.\n(b) To be acquired in leases from various third parties.\nNOTE REGARDING USE OF NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES\nThe Company's unaudited consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (\"GAAP\"). These GAAP financial statements include (i) unrealized non-cash adjustments and reclassifications, which can be significant, as a result of accounting requirements and elections made under accounting pronouncements relating to derivative instruments and hedging and (ii) other charges and benefits the Company believes are unusual and/or infrequent in nature and thus may make comparisons to its prior or future performance difficult.\nAs a result, the Company also provides financial information in this release that was not prepared in accordance with GAAP and should not be considered as an alternative to the information prepared in accordance with GAAP. The Company provides supplemental non-GAAP financial information (also referred to as \"excluding special items\"), including results that it refers to as \"economic,\" which the Company's management utilizes to evaluate its ongoing financial performance and the Company believes provides additional insight to investors as supplemental information to its GAAP results. The non-GAAP measures provided that reflect the Company's performance on an economic fuel cost basis include Fuel and oil expense, non-GAAP; Total operating expenses, non-GAAP; Operating expenses, non-GAAP, excluding Fuel and Oil expense; Operating expenses, non-GAAP, excluding Fuel and Oil expense and profitsharing; Operating income, non-GAAP; Operating margin, non-GAAP; Other (gains) losses, net, non-GAAP; Net income, non-GAAP; and Net income per share, diluted, non-GAAP. The Company's economic Fuel and oil expense results differ from GAAP results in that they only include the actual cash settlements from fuel hedge contracts - all reflected within Fuel and oil expense in the period of settlement. Thus, Fuel and oil expense on an \"economic\" basis has historically been utilized by the Company, as well as some of the other airlines that utilize fuel hedging, as it reflects the Company's actual net cash outlays for fuel during the applicable period, inclusive of settled fuel derivative contracts. Any net premium costs paid related to option contracts are reflected as a component of Other (gains) losses, net, for both GAAP and non-GAAP (including economic) purposes in the period of contract settlement. The Company believes these economic results provide a better measure of the impact of the Company's fuel hedges on its operating performance and liquidity since they exclude the unrealized, non-cash adjustments and reclassifications that are recorded in GAAP results in accordance with accounting guidance relating to derivative instruments, and they reflect all cash settlements related to fuel derivative contracts within Fuel and oil expense. This enables the Company's management, as well as investors and analysts, to consistently assess the Company's operating performance on a year-over-year or quarter-over-quarter basis after considering all efforts in place to manage fuel expense. However, because these measures are not determined in accordance with GAAP, such measures are susceptible to varying calculations, and not all companies calculate the measures in the same manner. As a result, the aforementioned measures, as presented, may not be directly comparable to similarly titled measures presented by other companies.\nFurther information on (i) the Company's fuel hedging program, (ii) the requirements of accounting for derivative instruments, and (iii) the causes of hedge ineffectiveness and/or mark-to-market gains or losses from derivative instruments is included in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2016.\nIn addition, the Company's GAAP results in the applicable periods include other charges or benefits that are also deemed \"special items\" that the Company believes make its results difficult to compare to prior periods, anticipated future periods, or industry trends. Financial measures identified as non-GAAP (or as excluding special items) have been adjusted to exclude special items. Special items include:\nContract ratification bonuses recorded for certain workgroups. As the bonuses would only be paid at ratification of the associated tentative agreement and would not represent an ongoing expense to the Company, management believes its results for the associated periods are more usefully compared if the impacts of ratification bonus amounts are excluded from results. Generally, union contract agreements cover a specified three- to five- year period, although such contracts officially never expire, and the agreed upon terms remain in place until a revised agreement is reached, which can be several years following the amendable date; A noncash impairment charge related to leased slots at Newark Liberty International Airport as a result of the Federal Aviation Administration announcement in April 2016 that this airport was being changed to a Level 2 schedule-facilitated airport from its previous designation as Level 3 (a \"slot\" is the right of an air carrier, pursuant to regulations of the Federal Aviation Administration, to operate a takeoff or landing at a specific time at certain airports); Lease termination costs recorded as a result of the Company acquiring 13 of its Boeing 737-300 aircraft off operating leases as part of the Company's strategic effort to remove its Classic aircraft from operations on or before September 29, 2017, in the most economically advantageous manner possible. The Company had not budgeted for these early lease termination costs, as they were subject to negotiations being concluded with the third-party lessors. The Company recorded the fair value of the aircraft acquired off operating leases, as well as any associated remaining obligations to the balance sheet as debt; An Aircraft grounding charge recorded in third quarter 2017, as a result of the Company grounding its remaining Boeing 737-300 aircraft on September 29, 2017. The loss was a result of the remaining net lease payments due and certain lease return requirements that may have to be performed on these leased aircraft prior to their return to the lessors as of the cease-use date. The Company had not budgeted for the lease return requirements, as they are subject to negotiation with third party lessors; and An adjustment to Provision for income taxes related to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act legislation enacted in December 2017, which resulted in a re-measurement of the Company's deferred tax assets and liabilities at the new corporate tax rate of 21 percent. This adjustment is a non-cash item and is being treated as a special item.\nBecause management believes each of these items can distort the trends associated with the Company's ongoing performance as an airline, the Company believes that evaluation of its financial performance can be enhanced by a supplemental presentation of results that exclude the impact of these items in order to enhance consistency and comparativeness with results in prior periods that do not include such items and as a basis for evaluating operating results in future periods. The following measures are often provided, excluding special items, and utilized by the Company's management, analysts, and investors to enhance comparability of year-over-year results, as well as to industry trends: Total operating expenses, non-GAAP; Operating expenses, non GAAP excluding Fuel and oil expense; Operating expenses, non-GAAP excluding Fuel and oil expense and profitsharing; Operating income, non-GAAP; Operating margin, non-GAAP; Other (gains) losses, net, non-GAAP; Provision for income taxes, non-GAAP; Net income, non-GAAP; and Net income per share, diluted, non-GAAP.\nThe Company has also provided free cash flow, which is a non-GAAP financial measure. The Company believes free cash flow is a meaningful measure because it demonstrates the Company's ability to service its debt, pay dividends, and make investments to enhance Shareholder value. Although free cash flow is commonly used as a measure of liquidity, definitions of free cash flow may differ; therefore, the Company is providing an explanation of its calculation for free cash flow. For the year ended December 31, 2017, the Company generated $1.8 billion in free cash flow, calculated as operating cash flows of $3.9 billion less capital expenditures of $2.1 billion less assets constructed for others of $126 million plus reimbursements for assets constructed for others of $126 million.\nThe Company has also provided its calculation of return on invested capital, which is a measure of financial performance used by management to evaluate its investment returns on capital. Return on invested capital is not a substitute for financial results as reported in accordance with GAAP, and should not be utilized in place of such GAAP results. Although return on invested capital is not a measure defined by GAAP, it is calculated by the Company, in part, using non-GAAP financial measures. Those non-GAAP financial measures are utilized for the same reasons as those noted above for Net income, non-GAAP and Operating income, non-GAAP - the comparable GAAP measures include charges or benefits that are deemed \"special items\" that the Company believes make its results difficult to compare to prior periods, anticipated future periods, or industry trends, and the Company's profitability targets and estimates, both internally and externally, are based on non-GAAP results since in the vast majority of cases the \"special items\" cannot be reliably predicted or estimated. The Company believes non-GAAP return on invested capital is a meaningful measure because it quantifies the Company's effectiveness in generating returns relative to the capital it has invested in its business. Although return on invested capital is commonly used as a measure of capital efficiency, definitions of return on invested capital differ; therefore, the Company is providing an explanation of its calculation for non-GAAP return on invested capital in the accompanying reconciliation, in order to allow investors to compare and contrast its calculation to those provided by other companies.\nView original content: http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/southwest-airlines-reports-record-fourth-quarter-and-annual-profit-45th-consecutive-year-of-profitability-300588041.html\nSOURCE Southwest Airlines Co.", "external_links": ["http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/southwest-airlines-reports-record-fourth-quarter-and-annual-profit-45th-consecutive-year-of-profitability-300588041.html", "https://www.southwest.com/?SRC=IRPRQ4EARN180125", "http://www.southwestairlinesinvestorrelations.com/"], "published": "2018-01-25T14:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-25T14:16:46.043+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
