Hopefully, this investigation and its outcome will prevent another tragedy from occurring,” said Police Chief Michael DeLeo in the statement. \nCoffey died Nov. 3 after attending “Big Brother Night” at the Pi Kappa Phi fraternity, where he was a pledge. An autopsy found his blood alcohol level was .447, more than five times the legal limit to drive, the Tallahassee Democrat reported. \nFlorida State University, a school of more than 41,000 students, suspended all fraternities and sororities after the incident.
