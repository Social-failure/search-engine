It was unclear when the interview would take place.\nAn interview with prosecutors would allow Bannon to have an attorney present during his appearance, as lawyers are not permitted in grand jury rooms.\nA spokesman for Mueller declined to comment on the agreement, first reported by CNN. A lawyer who represented Bannon in an appearance before the House of Representatives Intelligence Committee on Tuesday could not be immediately reached.\nBannon was fired from his White House job in August as the president sought to bring more order to his staff operations.\nFormer White House Chief Strategist Stephen Bannon arrives for an interview by the House Intelligence Committee investigating alleged Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. election on Capitol Hill in Washington, U.S., January 16, 2018.

They included scathing remarks about Donald Trump Jr., the president’s eldest son, for meeting during the campaign with a Russian lawyer who was said to have damaging information on Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton.\nMueller is investigating any potential collusion by Trump’s campaign with Moscow in alleged Russian meddling in the 2016 campaign. Russia denies such interference and Trump has denied any collusion.\nFILE PHOTO: White House Chief Strategist Stephen Bannon speaks at the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) in National Harbor, Maryland, U.S., February 23, 2017.

The person said they did not believe Bannon had hired a counsel for that yet.\nTwo other Trump associates, White House Deputy Chief of Staff Rick Dearborn, and former campaign manager Corey Lewandowski, were due to appear before the House panel behind closed doors on Wednesday, congressional sources said.\nCommittee aides were not immediately available to comment.\nThe House Intelligence Committee is conducting one of three congressional investigations of the Russia issue, separate from Mueller’s probe.\nReporting by Karen Freifeld, Patricia Zengerle, Susan Heavey and Jonathan Landay; Writing by Tim Ahmann and Warren Strobel; Editing by Frances Kerry\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-17T17:31:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-17T17:54:52.007+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
