While real estate and homebuilding stocks in Brazil performed well in 2017 on the front edge of a consumer-led turnaround, the numbers indicate real estate demand in Latin America's largest economy still has a way to go to recover. \nAccording to the study, residential real estate prices fell 0.53 percent in nominal terms in 2017. Considering annual inflation of 2.78 percent, prices fell 3.23 percent in real terms, FipeZap said. \nResidential markets performed much better in some cities than others. For instance, prices rose in nominal terms by 4.47 percent in the city of Belo Horizonte, but fell 4.45 percent in Rio de Janeiro, which has been hit by low oil prices, corruption scandal, and a state-level debt crisis. \nAverage residential real estate prices ended 2017 at 7.631 reais ($2.36) in Brazil, FipeZap said, with the highest prices registered in Brazil's three largest cities, Rio de Janeiro, Sao Paulo, and Brasilia.
