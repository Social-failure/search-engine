Combined proceeds from both deals amount to nearly $1.25 billion, of which almost $1 billion will be in cash, Noble said.\nReporting by John Benny in Bengaluru; Editing by Anil D'Silva and Sai Sachin Ravikumar\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-29T23:46:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-30T00:02:48.013+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
