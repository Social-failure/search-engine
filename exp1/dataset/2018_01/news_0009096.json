And the ANC meeting only ends on Friday so there will be more headlines and that means rand volatility should continue,” said trader at RMB Jim Bryson. \n“It’s really difficult to call, it needs to close above 12.52 to get out of these ranges, but a test of around 12.20 cannot be totally discounted,” Bryson said. \nThe rand has rallied since mid-December, supported by investors’ hopes that the newly elected leader ANC head Cyril Ramaphosa would push through business-friendly policies. \nThe rally has since stalled, with signs of higher rates in the United States shifting some of the focus back to fundamentals, although analysts said a decision on Zuma remained the main swing factor. \n“He (Ramaphosa) is likely to do everything in his power to reduce Zuma’s influence and to facilitate a rapid end to his time in power. That is rand positive,” said analyst at Frankfurt-based Commerzbank Elisabeth Andreae. \nBonds tracked the weaker currency, with yield on the benchmark paper due in 2026 up 7 basis points to 8.655 percent. \nIn equities, the benchmark Top-40 index slipped 0.03 percent to 53,168 points while the All-Share index declined 0.22 percent to 59,980 points. \nThe banking sector lowered 1.03 percent while general retails fell 1.55 percent on lower investors appetite for emerging markets. \n“International invertors are lowering their exposure to emerging markets,” said Cratos Capital equities trader Greg Davies. \nNedbank fell 2.32 percent to 254.20 rand, FirstRand lowered 0.62 percent to 63.00 rand and Barclays Africa weakened 0.99 percent to 174.46 rand. \nFurther losses were curbed by the local bullion sector which lifted 2.05 percent on the back of a jump in gold prices to its highest level in nearly four months. \nAngloGold Ashanti rose 3.62 percent to 133.50 rand and Gold Fields lifted 0.87 percent to 52.45 rand.
