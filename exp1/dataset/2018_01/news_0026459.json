(NYSE: BWA), a global leader in clean and efficient technology solutions for combustion, hybrid and electric vehicles, today announced its three-year net new business backlog, its guidance for full year 2018 and its guidance for first quarter 2018.\nThree-Year Net New Business Backlog\nThe company expects its net new business backlog to drive a compound annual organic growth rate of 5.0% - 7.0% from 2017 through 2020, compared to compound annual industry growth of 0% - 1.0% over the same time period:\nNet new business within a range of $650 million to $730 million in 2018, $675 million to $800 million in 2019 and $700 million to $825 million in 2020. Based on these assumptions, the company's 2020 revenue outlook is $11.5 billion - $11.8 billion. Asia, the Americas and Europe are expected to account for approximately 41%, 38% and 21%, respectively, of the total net new business backlog over the three-year period. Approximately 30% is expected in China. The net new business backlog represents growth across all propulsion architectures with combustion, hybrid and electric vehicles expected to account for approximately 50%, 45% and 5%, respectively, of the total net new business backlog over the three-year period.\nFull Year 2018 Guidance\nThe company also provided its initial guidance for full year 2018:\nNet sales of $10.4 billion - $10.6 billion, implying organic sales growth of 5.0% to 7.0% compared with expected 2017 net sales of $9.79 billion. Foreign currencies are expected to increase sales by $75 million, primarily due to the appreciation of the Euro. The purchase of Sevcon is expected to increase sales by $45 million. Excluding the impact of stronger foreign currencies and the acquisition of Sevcon, net sales growth is expected to be 5.0% to 7.0%. Operating income as a percentage of net sales of 12.6% - 12.7% compared to 12.5% in 2017. The acquisition of Sevcon is expected to decrease margins by approximately 10 basis points. Net earnings of $4.15 to $4.25 per diluted share. The acquisition of Sevcon is expected to be ($0.06) dilutive to EPS. Excluding this impact, guidance implies a 10% to 12.5% year-over-year improvement in EPS. Effective tax rate of approximately 29%, exclusive of any impact of the new U.S. tax act. Free cash flow within a range of $500 million to $550 million. Share repurchases of approximately $100 million.\nFirst Quarter 2018 Guidance\nThe company also provided guidance for first quarter 2018:\nOrganic net sales growth of 3.0% to 5.5% compared with first quarter 2017 net sales of $2.41 billion. Foreign currencies are expected to increase sales by $70 million, or +2.9%. The acquisition of Sevcon is expected to increase revenue by $15 million.
