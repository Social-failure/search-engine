MIDDLE WAY \nThe EU’s Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier has said UK financial services won’t keep “passporting” rights to offer services across the bloc as Britain is leaving the single market. \nFinancial firms could rely to some extent on equivalence, whereby the EU grants market access if Britain copies the bloc’s rules, Barnier has said. \nWoods said it was technically feasible to devise a system between staying in the single market and the “rule taking” system of equivalence. \n“It’s perfectly possible to have something in the middle,” Woods said. \nThis would only be needed for a narrow subset of the UK financial market such as investment banks and asset managers that operate cross-border, he said. \nFinancial lobbyists have suggested the BoE could have a new competitiveness remit to help the UK financial sector stay ahead after Brexit. \n“I am personally very cautious about that,” Woods said. \nA competitiveness objective would raise the risk of dilution of focus and the risk of weaker regulation, he added.
