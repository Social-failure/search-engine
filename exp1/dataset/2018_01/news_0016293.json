My level was there during the whole week, so I‘m really happy with the trophy.” \nThe Romanian, a first-time WTA finalist, saved more championship points and held her serve when play resumed before the defending champion served out the match that lasted two hours and 29 minutes in total. \n“I was really close,” Buzarnescu said, upset with her high number of unforced errors. “I should have been more patient, and not complain that much.” Reporting by Sudipto Ganguly in Mumbai; Editing by John O'Brien", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-13T13:08:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-13T13:26:54.008+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
