Apple said it made the decision to throttle the iPhone speeds in an effort to preserve aging batteries and to prevent the phones from turning off. \nApple responded by dropping the price of battery replacements for phones from $79 to $29 . A battery replacement would bring the phone back up to its full speed potential. \nThe company has since apologized and says an update coming this spring, iOS 11.3 , will allow users to turn off the speed-throttling function at the cost of battery life. \nApple was not immediately available for comment. The SEC declined to comment. The Justice Department was not immediately available for comment.
