The ovens convert coal into coke, a fuel used in blast furnaces in iron ore smelting.\nAdditionally, Cokenergy will spend $250,000 on a lead abatement project in the East Chicago area to reduce lead hazards in schools, day-care centers, and other buildings.\nLead pollution harms brain function in children and can cause other health problems. Sulfur dioxide is a particulate that can harm human lungs and hearts.\nThe companies will pay the $5 million fine in equal amounts to the U.S. federal government and the state of Indiana, the department said.\nReporting by Timothy Gardner; Editing by James Dalgleish\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-26T00:48:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-26T01:15:12.001+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
