The index had slipped to as low as 23,588.07 on Friday when the dollar took a steep dive versus its Japanese peer.\n“The yen’s appreciation against the dollar has stopped and this brightened sentiment, along with expectations for robust company quarterly results,” said Masahiro Ichikawa, senior strategist at Sumitomo Mitsui Asset Management.\nInformation technology service provider Obic Co rose as much as 7.9 percent to an 18-year peak after the Nikkei business daily reported that the company’s operating profit for the nine months through December likely rose by a fifth.\nExporters were lifted as the dollar on Tuesday bounced back from four-month lows versus the yen.\nToyota Motor Corp added 1.05 percent, Tokyo Electron rose 1.6 percent and Panasonic Corp climbed 0.6 percent.\nThe broader Topix rose 0.55 percent to 1,894.25.\nOut of Tokyo’s 33 subindexes, 22 were in positive territory, led by fish and forestry and electrical machinery . Iron and steel and sea transport led the losing sectors.
