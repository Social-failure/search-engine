The e-tailer is expected to name finalist cities in the next few weeks. \nCorrection: A previous version of this story said Apple was opening a second campus. The company already has campuses in Cupertino, California, and Austin, Texas. \nClarification: This story was revised to clarify that Apple said the $350 billion would be a \"contribution\" to the U.S. economy.
