They joined Valencia, who defeated last season’s finalists Alaves on penalties earlier on Wednesday, and Sevilla, who knocked out Atletico Madrid on Tuesday, in the draw for the last four. League leaders Barcelona host Espanyol on Thursday, trailing 1-0 from the first leg in the last quarter-final.
