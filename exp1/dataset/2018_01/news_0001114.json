Nonetheless, Honduras remains one of the world’s deadliest peacetime nations. \nIn recent weeks, the small coffee-exporting country has been convulsed by protests in which at least 31 people have died. The opposition says the election was stolen by President Juan Orlando Hernandez, a U.S. ally on tackling migration and drugs. \nLate last month, the United States backed the re-election of Hernandez despite widespread misgivings about the vote count, prompting the opposition candidate to describe his bid for the presidency as a “lost cause.” [nL1N1OM0T9] Reporting by Gustavo Palencia; Editing by Susan Thomas", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-02T21:01:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-02T21:22:44.032+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
