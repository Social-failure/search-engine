According to that plan, the CDC’s flu tracking program would be suspended during a shutdown. \nBut late Friday night, officials told reporters on a conference call that the program would continue. \n“CDC specifically will be continuing their ongoing influenza surveillance. They will be collecting data reported by states, hospitals, others, and they’ll be reporting out critical information needed for state and local health authorities to provide, track, prevent and treat the disease,” an official said. \nA spokesperson for the CDC was not immediately available for comment. \nIn its latest report on the status of the U.S. flu epidemic released on Friday, the CDC said flu activity continued to increase across the country, with 32 states and Puerto Rico experiencing high activity. \nDuring the week ended Jan. 13, 10 children died from flu, bringing total pediatric deaths to 30 for the 2017-18 flu season. \nThe flu is now widespread in 49 of the 50 U.S. states, with only local activity reported in Hawaii. \nThe flu strain currently causing the most infections is H3N2, an influenza A virus that has been linked with increased hospitalizations and death, especially in young children and adults over age 65.
