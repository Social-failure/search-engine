Total assets at December 31, 2017, were $3.2 billion. In addition, the board of directors declared its ninth consecutive quarterly cash dividend. The cash dividend of $0.15 per share will be payable on or about February 14, 2018, to shareholders of record as of January 31, 2018.\n“We had a strong year in 2017 as we continued to build our business at a sustainable, measured pace,” said Don M. Griffith, Chairman and CEO of Grandpoint Capital, Inc., and Grandpoint Bank. “We saw substantial growth in our core deposits, which speaks to the strength of our long-standing client relationships, and we continued to operate a very safe bank, building our balance sheet with quality assets.\n“During the fourth quarter 2017, we had several nonrecurring items that reduced our tangible book value, capital ratios and earnings,” said Griffith. “In November, we declared a one-time special dividend of $1.25 per share, and in December, we had to charge off $6.6 million of our deferred tax assets to reflect the reduction in federal income tax rates on corporations. In spite of these major adjustments, we still achieved a return on average assets of 0.76% and a return on average tangible equity of 7.52%, and we reported basic earnings per share of $0.74 and tangible book value per share of $8.75.” The lower federal tax rate will increase earnings by almost 20% in 2018 and beyond.\nAt December 31, 2017, deposits totaled $2.4 billion of which 46% is comprised of non-interest-bearing deposits. During 2017, we focused on developing a more liquid and stable deposit base by replacing non-core high-cost money market accounts with core business demand deposit relationships.\nTotal loans were $2.4 billion, and asset quality remained strong during the quarter as the Bank continued to maintain a prudent and disciplined risk strategy. Grandpoint Bank’s capital ratios remain in excess of the regulatory minimums, with a Leverage Ratio of 9.18% and Total Risk-Based Capital Ratio of 11.30% at December 31, 2017.\nIn December 2017, Grandpoint Bank received a superior 5-star rating from independent rating and research firm BauerFinancial for the eighteenth consecutive quarter. The latest rating was based on September 30, 2017, financial data. The 5-star rating, for strength, stability and soundness, is only awarded to the nation’s strongest banks.\nGrandpoint Capital, Inc. and Grandpoint Bank are headquartered in Los Angeles. Calif. Grandpoint Bank and its divisions operate in southern California, Arizona and Vancouver, Wash.\nMore information about Grandpoint is available at www.grandpointbank.com .\nGrandpoint Capital, Inc. and Subsidiaries Consolidated Balance Sheets Dollars in $1,000's June 30, December 31, 2010 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 Cash and due from banks $ 3,501 $ 27,791 $ 22,324 $ 43,714 $ 41,177 $ 37,688 $ 25,113 $ 28,919 $ 32,238 Interest-bearing deposits in banks 72,825 33,604 127,803 291,545 171,408 314,005 171,625 213,365 151,556 Cash and Cash Equivalents 76,326 61,395 150,127 335,259 212,585 351,693 196,738 242,284 183,794 Investment Securities 3,284 97,399 208,939 318,501 230,591 266,479 573,260 579,275 502,615 Loans: Construction 481 18,327 20,324 54,315 79,588 110,286 130,801 194,471 137,165 Single family residential -
