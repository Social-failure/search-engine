The four stepped down on Tuesday following demands from President Michel Temer, after prosecutors accused multiple vice presidents at the bank of “irregularities.” \nIn an attempt to shield the bank from political influence, executives that were previously appointed directly by Brazil´s president will now have to be named by the board. \nThe new rules also mandate that at least 25 percent of Caixa’s board is made up of independent members. Recruitment firms will also have to be involved in appointing senior management.
