All financial results are unaudited.\nThe bank finished the year with solid momentum. The loan portfolio grew $19.2 million, or 8%, to $262.8 million at December 31, 2017, compared to $243.5 million at December 31, 2016. The solid growth in loans reflects the improving economy and appeal of the bank’s values-based banking model. Total deposits grew $16.9 million, or 6%, to $304.8 million at year end, compared to $287.9 million at December 31, 2016. Asset quality remained solid, with nonperforming assets to total assets declining to 0.01% from 0.09%.\nPre-tax net income totaled $415,000 for the fourth quarter of 2017, compared to $841,000 in the fourth quarter of 2016, reflecting an increased provision for loan losses and higher operating expenses related to increased IT and professional services costs. Pre-tax net income grew 15% to $2.7 million in 2017 from $2.3 million in 2016, reflecting a 17% increase in revenues, year-over-year. The fourth quarter was impacted by the downgrade of a loan relationship for which a $345,000 loan loss provision was recorded. Including the $1.6 million additional tax provision for the revaluation of its deferred tax asset, the bank lost $1.4 million in the fourth quarter and recorded a profit of $27,000 for the year.\nThe bank also announced in December the signing of a definitive merger agreement with Amalgamated Bank. “Amalgamated Bank, a fellow B Corp, will acquire New Resource Bank in a merger that will extend and grow the reach of our founding mission,” said Vincent Siciliano, president and CEO. “Amalgamated, a New York-based bank that is also a Global Alliance for Banking on Values (GABV) member, has nearly a century of experience in serving the needs of working people. Their mission is to be the financial institution for progressive people and organizations: those who are working and living to make the world more just, compassionate and sustainable. I believe the combination of our two banks creates an even more effective catalyst for change.”\nKey financial results from 2017 compared with the like period in 2016 include:\nLoan growth: Loans outstanding grew 8% to $262.8 million at year-end 2017, from $243.6 million at year-end 2016. Asset quality: Non-performing assets to total assets decreased to 0.01% as of December 31, 2017, compared to 0.09% as of December 31, 2016. Deposit growth: Deposits rose 6% for the year, reaching $304.8 million at year-end 2017, from $287.9 million at year-end 2016. Total assets: Total assets increased 5% to $348.6 million as of December 31, 2017, from $330.8 million as of December 31, 2016. Net interest income: Net interest income was $3.5 million for the fourth quarter and $14.0 million for the full year 2017, an increase of 6% and 15% respectively in 2016. Non-interest income: Non-interest income was $430,000 for the fourth quarter and $1.4 million for the full year 2017, an increase of 47% and 34% respectively in 2016. Treasury fees and bank-owned life insurance contributed to this growth. Net interest margin: Net interest margin remains well above industry average at 4.26% in the fourth quarter and 4.29% for the full year in 2017. Non-interest expense: Non-interest expense was $3.2 million for the quarter and $12.2 million for the full year 2017, an increase of 15% for both periods from 2016. The rise was influenced by increased staffing needs to support the bank’s growth, the 2017 conversion of the bank’s information technology system and professional services. Provision expense: Provision expense reflected a $345,000 increase for the quarter. For the full year, provision totaled $565,000, an increase from $339,000 in 2016. The quarter and full year was impacted by the downgrade of one loan relationship. Efficiency ratio: The bank’s efficiency ratio was 80.9% for the fourth quarter and 79.1% for the full year 2017, an increase of 4.5% for the quarter, but an improvement from 80.1% for 2016. Performance was impacted by a 17% increase in revenue, partially offset by a 14% growth in expenses. Risk-based capital: The common equity tier 1 capital ratio was 12.51% and the total risk-based capital ratio was 13.76% in the fourth quarter of 2017, significantly above the standard for a well-capitalized bank.\n“The success of New Resource Bank over the years will result in a powerful new union of two values-based banks — New Resource and Amalgamated Bank of New York. I am pleased at the momentum this gives the values-based banking movement to address climate and social injustice and restore the financial system to its proper role in support of people and the planet,” stated Mark A. Finser, chairman of the New Resource Bank board. Mark Finser is expected to join the Amalgamated Bank Board once the merger between the two banks has closed.\nAbout New Resource Bank\nNew Resource Bank ( www.newresourcebank.com ) is a triple-bottom-line bank serving values-driven businesses and nonprofits that are building a more sustainable world.
