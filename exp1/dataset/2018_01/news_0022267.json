If they are charged, it will be a rare prosecution of members of the Egyptian security forces. \nMohamed Abdul-Hakim, known to his friends and family as Afroto, died in hospital shortly after being arrested on suspicion of drug dealing. \nAfter his death, 43 people were arrested in clashes with security forces that broke out outside the Mokattam police station where he had been briefly held. \nA forensics report showed he died as a result of internal bleeding and an injury to his spleen. His brother told Reuters his death was caused by severe beating he received. \nRights groups say police brutality is widespread in Egypt, enabled by a culture of impunity, and a string of incidents have triggered protests and riots. \nAnger at police was a major factor in setting off the 2011 uprising that ended President Hosni Mubarakâ€™s 30-year rule. \nEgyptian authorities deny allegations that security forces round up people and torture them in secret detention centres.
