His supporters say modern technology would allow him to rule remotely.\nReporting by Ingrid Melander; Editing by Paul Day\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-01-22T18:46:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-23T18:18:28.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
