Times President Mickie Rosen will take over.\nNational Public Radio reported the allegations of crude conduct and said Levinsohn was a defendant in two sexual harassment lawsuits before he joined the Times as publisher in August. Some Times employees had called for Levinsohn to be fired.\nTronc didn't indicate how long the investigation will take. But in an email to employees, Tronc CEO Justin Dearborn said the company won't hesitate to \"take further action, if appropriate, once the review is complete.\"\n1:37 p.m.\nLos Angeles Times journalists have voted to unionize for the first time in the paper's 136-year history.\nThe National Labor Relations Board on Friday announced results of a Jan. 4 newsroom vote.\nReporters, copy editors and other workers voted 248 to 44 for representation by NewsGuild-Communications Workers of America.\nThe union will now begin negotiating for a contract with Times owner Tronc Inc.\nTronc, which also owns the Chicago Tribune, San Diego Union-Tribune and Orlando Sentinel, says it respects the outcome of the Times election and looks forward to what it calls \"productive conversations with union leadership.\"\nThe Times vote followed rising discontent with working conditions as the paper slashed jobs and struggled with declining advertising revenues and falling circulation in the face of online competition.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-20T01:06:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-20T19:01:22.006+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
