Boosted by the latest round of earnings, including those from Intel and AbbVie , the three main U.S. indexes climbed to record closing highs on Friday. However, gains in the benchmark Australian index might be capped by a weakness in materials stocks which could fall on lower commodities prices. The local share price index futures rose 0.5 percent or 30 points to 6,015, a 35-point discount to the underlying S&P/ASX 200 index close. The benchmark closed marginally lower on Thursday. New Zealand's benchmark S&P/NZX 50 index fell 0.1 percent or 5.840 points to 8,305.580 in early trade.
