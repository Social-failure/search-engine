It’s a murderous state.”\nPence will conduct media interviews during his visit to South Korea, the official said.\n“He’s going to root on our Olympians, and he’s excited about that. He’s going to ensure that from a messaging standpoint that it isn’t turned into two weeks of propaganda,” the official said.\nThe South Korean government earlier on Tuesday rejected criticism that the games had been hijacked by North Korea, saying the event will help defuse tensions over Pyongyang’s nuclear and missile program.\nFollowing recent North-South talks that led to an agreement for North Korea to send a delegation to the Olympics, some opposition politicians and conservatives have criticized Pyongyang’s participation in the games in the South Korean alpine resort town of Pyeongchang.\nU.S. President Donald Trump and top advisers have publicly welcomed the recent talks between the Koreas, but U.S. officials have said privately that Pyongyang might be trying to drive a wedge between allies Washington and Seoul.\nTensions between North Korea and the United States have run high over Pyongyang’s efforts to develop a nuclear-tipped missile capable of hitting the United States.\nWriting by Matt Spetalnick; Editing by Cynthia Osterman\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-24T00:35:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-24T00:42:39.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
