Facebook said about 1.40 billion people were using its service daily as of Dec. 31, up 14 percent from a year earlier, compared with analysts’ estimate of $1.41 billion, according to financial data and analytics firm FactSet. \nFacebook had warned earlier this month that user engagement would take a hit in the near term from attempts to tweak its flagship News Feed feature. \n“Already last quarter, we made changes to show fewer viral videos to make sure people’s time is well spent,” Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg said in a statement. \nThe company also plans to highlight “trustworthy” news in the feed following allegations that Russian operatives and others spread false reports on the site, particularly during the 2016 U.S. Presidential election. \nThis change is set to shrink the amount of news on Facebook to about 4 percent of all content from 5 percent currently. \nNet income attributable to Facebook shareholders rose to $4.27 billion, or $1.44 per share, in the fourth quarter ended Dec. 31 from $3.56 billion, or $1.21 per share, a year earlier. \nExcluding a tax provision, the company earned $2.21 per share, topping analysts’ estimates of $1.95, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. \nTotal revenue rose 47 percent to $12.97 billion, while full-year revenue was also up 47 percent at $40.65 billion. \nTotal advertising revenue was $12.78 billion, compared with analysts’ estimate of $12.30 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. \nMobile ad revenue accounted for 89 percent of the total ad sales, up from 84 percent a year earlier.
