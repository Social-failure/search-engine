REUTERS/Mike Blake/File Photo Target raised its same-store sales growth forecast for the quarter ending January to 3.4 percent from a prior forecast of flat to up 2 percent earlier.\nResearch firm Retail Metrics’ President Ken Perkins said that, if that target were met, it would be the company’s strongest quarterly gain since the first quarter of 2012.\nTarget is the latest in a run of relatively upbeat holiday sales numbers from brick-and-mortar retailers who have suffered most from the huge gains made by Amazon.com ( AMZN.O ) and other online retailers over the past decade.\nShares of department store chain Kohl’s ( KSS.N ) on Monday surged after it reported a 6.9 percent rise in same-store sales for the same months.\nTarget said same-store sales in November and December gained in all five of its core merchandise categories: home, apparel, food & beverage, hardlines and essentials.\nKitchen items from brands like Threshold, KitchenAid and Keurig, and cordless vacuums from Roomba and Dyson were popular gifting items.\nAn exclusive furniture and household goods brand, co-designed by TV personalities Chip and Joanna Gaines, was also a hit after launching in November, the company said.\nTarget’s fourth-quarter profit forecast includes a 6 cent to 8 cent benefit from the newly-approved reduction in Federal corporate tax rates.\n(The story corrected to remove reference to Target being the No. 2 U.S. retailer in paragraph 1)\nReporting by Siddharth Cavale and Vibhuti Sharma in Bengaluru; Editing by Bernard Orr and Arun Koyyur\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-09T14:13:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-09T14:26:39.026+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
