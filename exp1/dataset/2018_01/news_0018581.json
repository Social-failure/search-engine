We’ve never previously seen sales rates at this level,” he said. \nThe builder also said its total completions had risen 2 percent to 7,324 homes in the period and it expects this year to beat the 17,395 homes it built in the twelve months to the end of June 2017. \nThe average selling price of its houses had increased 6.5 percent to 281,000 pounds ($379,100) in the second half of last year, the latest builder to benefit from rising prices which have driven bumper profits across the sector. \nShares in Barratt were down 1.1 percent at 627 pence at 0818 GMT. \n“Barratt is our least preferred housebuilder due to relatively low margins,” analysts at Liberum said.
