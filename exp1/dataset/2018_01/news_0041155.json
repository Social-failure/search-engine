The S&P financial index .SPSY rose 0.68 percent as the best performing of the major sectors. \nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJI rose 41.31 points, or 0.16 percent, to 26,252.12, the S&P 500 .SPX lost 1.6 points, or 0.06 percent, to 2,837.54 and the Nasdaq Composite .IXIC dropped 45.23 points, or 0.61 percent, to 7,415.06. \nEarnings season continues to be strong, with S&P 500 growth expected at 12.4 percent, according to Thomson Reuters data through Wednesday morning. Of the 88 companies in the index that have posted results, 78.4 percent have topped expectations versus the 72 percent beat rate for the past four quarters. \nAmong those posting results, General Electric ( GE.N ) fell 2.66 percent after the company revealed a regulatory investigation of a multibillion-dollar insurance charge. \nThe company in its earnings report forecast further weakening of its troubled power business and reported a $10 billion loss and a 5-percent fall in revenue. \nAbbott Laboratories ( ABT.N ) jumped 4.20 percent after quarterly profit and 2018 adjusted earnings forecast beat estimates. \nSemiconductor stocks .SOX were off 2.31 percent and pulled the Nasdaq lower as Texas Instruments ( TXN.O ) slumped 8.50 percent after it posted the slowest revenue growth in four quarters on softer demand for its chips used in communications equipment. \nDeclining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by a 1.21-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.68-to-1 ratio favored decliners. \nThe S&P 500 posted 141 new 52-week highs and one new low; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 183 new highs and 12 new lows. \nVolume on U.S. exchanges was 7.63 billion shares, compared to the 6.53 billion average over the last 20 trading days.
