(OTCQB:ACFN), announced today that it has reached an agreement to sell its remaining 41.15% interest in DSIT Solutions Ltd. for $5.8 million, before fees and taxes, to an Israeli investor group. The sale of the DSIT stake represents one of the final steps in refocusing Acorn on the long-term growth potential of its OmniMetrix wireless remote monitoring and control services for gas pipelines and stand-by generators for cell towers, medical facilities, data centers, public transportation systems and other facilities. The transaction is expected to close within about 30 days, subject to specific closing conditions, including approval of the Israeli Antitrust Authority.\nDSIT Solutions provides underwater sonar and acoustic detection systems and is 50% owned by Israel-based Rafael Advanced Defense Systems Ltd. DSIT generated revenues of $17.9 million in the latest-twelve-month period ended September 30, 2017.\nAcorn CEO Jan Loeb commented, “Concluding a two-year restructuring effort, we have executed an agreement to complete Acorn’s transformation from an undercapitalized, diversified holding company with negative operating cash flow, to a focused leader in the growing market for the remote monitoring and control of industrial assets with a solid balance sheet.\n“Proceeds from the sale will be used to eliminate Acorn’s debt, satisfy liabilities and provide working capital. Following the transaction, we expect to have approximately $2 million of cash, which we believe is sufficient to fund the operations of Acorn and OmniMetrix for the foreseeable future. We plan to update our shareholders in greater detail on our financial positon and growth strategy following the closing of the DSIT sale.”\nAbout Acorn ( www.acornenergy.com )\nAcorn Energy, Inc. is a holding company with investments in two portfolio companies:\nOmniMetrix™, Inc.
