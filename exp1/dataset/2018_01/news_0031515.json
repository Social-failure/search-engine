This compares with a profit of 916.1 million dirhams in the corresponding period of 2016.\nThe average forecast of three analysts polled by Reuters was for DIB to make a quarterly profit of 1.06 billion dirhams.\nIn an investor presentation, the bank said it was targeting loan growth of between 10 and 15 percent in 2018, the same target it set for 2017. The bank’s loan growth reached 16 percent in 2017, a level ahead of many of its competitors.
