The latest Apple update, iOS 11.2.2 , is now available for the iPhone 5S and later and iPad Air and later.\nThe vulnerabilities could allow a hacker to steal information stored in the memory of a wide range of computer chips running on personal devices. That applies not just to computers and phones, but also the servers in data centers, including those used to run cloud computing services.\n--CNBC's Matt Rosoff contributed to this post.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-08T21:08:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-08T21:08:50.025+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
