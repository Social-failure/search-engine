The gazette will be withdrawn from tomorrow,” President Maithripala Sirisena said at an election rally on Sunday. \nThe move comes as the government’s main coalition partners, the center-left Sri Lanka Freedom Party and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe’s center-right United National Party, are campaigning for long-delayed local elections. \nOfficials at the finance ministry said the ban was lifted after repeated requests from the tourism industry to extend bar hours and allow female tourists to buy alcohol. \nBut that move was criticized by opposition parliamentarians who said the move would damage Sri Lanka’s Buddhist values. Sinhalese Buddhists account for more than 70 percent of the island nation’s 21 million population. \nSri Lanka will hold local government elections on Feb. 10.
