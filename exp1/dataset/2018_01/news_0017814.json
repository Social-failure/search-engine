But a sustainable solution to the challenges of the new information ecosystem requires further measures,” he said. “In particular, a viable subscription model on platforms that enables publishers to build a direct relationship with readers and to manage the terms of access to their content.” SPONSORED FINANCIAL CONTENT ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-12T11:12:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-12T17:50:42.040+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
