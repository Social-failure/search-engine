The end of the commercialization of previous-generation stents, DES and BMS, and the decrease in sales of non-proprietary products led to a 5% fall in revenues compared with the fourth quarter of 2016.\nThe Xposition S stent accounted for 87% of STENTYS’ total revenues in 2017, and benefited from fast-growing demand throughout the year.\nOver 2017 as a whole, STENTYS recorded sales of €7.0 million, versus €7.3 million in 2016.\nSubstantial reduction of the cash burn: cash position of €8.8 million at December 31, 2017\nAt December 31, 2017, STENTYS had a cash position of €8.8 million, versus €10.3 million at June 30, 2017, reflecting a substantial reduction of the cash burn during the second half of the year as a result of the cost-cutting program implemented by the Company.\nChristophe Lottin, Chief Executive Officer of STENTYS, comments: “2017 was a transitional year for STENTYS during which we reorganized our offering by focusing our resources on our flagship product, Xposition S, with the aim of accelerating its penetration of our strategic markets. The Xposition S sales momentum observed during the fourth quarter validates the relevance of our strategy for this specialty drug-eluting stent that is generating considerable interest among the global cardiology community. In accordance with our intention of expanding our proprietary product portfolio, we have added Serpentis, our new latest-generation drug-eluting stent for routine procedures, to our product range at the end of the year. Its pre-commercialization has begun in a number of pilot European facilities. We thus now have a solid offering of proprietary drug-eluting stents on which we expect to see a return to a strong growth in 2018.”\nAbout STENTYS\nSTENTYS develops and commercializes innovative solutions for the treatment of patients with complex artery disease.
