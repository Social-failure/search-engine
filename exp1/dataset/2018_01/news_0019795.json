We will be watching that,” Bostic said on Monday. “If we got close to it I would argue strongly that we should be extremely cautious” with further rate increases. He said his “base case” was for two to three rate increases in 2018, compared to a median of three among his colleagues.\nReporting by Howard Schneider; Editing by Andrea Ricci\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-01-09T03:28:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-09T16:57:33.041+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
