I never want to play in a tournament if I’m not 100 percent fit.” \nDimitrov, who suffered a shock defeat by unseeded Briton Kyle Edmund in the quarter-finals   earlier this week, said that fatigue was also a factor in his failure to reach the Melbourne Park semi-finals. \n“I played some tough matches in Australia and I got tired,” the 26-year-old, who won the biggest title of his career at last year’s season-ending ATP Finals in London, said. \n“I had only one week rest after the end of last season... (and) ... you just can’t go against your body.” $1 = 0.8052 euros Reporting by Angel Krasimirov, editing by Pritha Sarkar", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-27T15:04:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-27T15:27:10.002+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
