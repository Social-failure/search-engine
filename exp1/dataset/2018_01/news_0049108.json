Nevertheless, Kingdom’s rebound was seen as a vote of confidence in the company. Saudi officials said the prince would keep control of Kingdom after his release. \nRising Saudi stocks outnumbered losers by 102 to 68. Petrochemical firm Sipchem gained 2.4 percent after it estimated fourth-quarter net profit jumped to 164.4 million riyals ($43.8 million) from 31.9 million riyals, beating SICO Bahrain’s forecast of 154 million riyals and NCB Capital’s 135 million riyals. \nTop petrochemical producer Saudi Basic Industries, which dropped 2.8 percent on Sunday after weak quarterly earnings, rebounded 1.0 percent. \nBut fashion retailer Fawaz Abdulaziz Alhokair Co, which had jumped 6.8 percent on Sunday after some of its major shareholders were released in the broad corruption probe, fell back 0.7 percent. \nDubai’s index was flat and Abu Dhabi edged down 0.2 percent as Abu Dhabi National Energy retreated 3.5 percent. \nQatar’s index slipped 0.4 percent as drilling rig provider Gulf International Services, which had climbed 3.6 percent on Sunday in heavy trade, pulled back 1.8 percent.
