Aqua America Inc, American Water’s closest rival, has said interest among municipalities in selling off assets has never been so high. \nWhile lead contamination has dominated headlines and fears, particularly after the Flint, Michigan disaster, Story believes the next threat is from substances that are not even monitored. \nThere are 1,400 microbes alone that can affect drinking water, but the Environmental Protection Agency only regulates 90 contaminants, she said. \nWorking with the EPA, American Water is now starting voluntary tests for 40 “emerging contaminants” that are not yet regulated, Story said. \nWhether any new federal infrastructure program spurs private investment in infrastructure, U.S. tax reform is already becoming “an infrastructure plan for regulated utilities,” Story said. \nThat is because the sector’s profits are regulated by state public service commissions, which can direct how the utilities will spend their new tax savings. \n“Every dollar of the reduction of our tax goes back to our customers, not to our bottom line,” Story said. \nThe utility is working with each state’s regulators to determine whether to return savings to customers, accelerate capital projects or some combination. \nShe said she would not disclose the company’s total tax savings until its Feb. 21 earnings call.
