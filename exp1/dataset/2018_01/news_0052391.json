Slideshow (6 Images) \nLuis Suarez finally levelled for the Catalans in the 72nd minute, scoring for the eighth league game in a row following wave after wave of attacks from Barca and a handful of impressive saves from visiting goalkeeper Fernando Pacheco. \nThe equaliser maintained Barca’s status as the only unbeaten team in Europe’s top five leagues and Messi then gave them a seventh consecutive Liga win by curling a sumptuous free kick beyond the reach of the former Real Madrid keeper in the 84th. \nBarca top the standings with 57 points, 11 ahead of nearest challengers Atletico Madrid and 19 ahead of champions Real Madrid.
