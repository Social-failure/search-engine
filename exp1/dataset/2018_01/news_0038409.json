In his war on drugs, Duterte has been accused of allowing a culture of impunity to flourish. \nIn the same memorandum, Dela Rosa ordered police to immediately take injured suspects to hospital, and establish a data base of those who died in police operations. \nIn June, Reuters revealed that police have shot hundreds of people during anti-drug operations, before taking them to hospitals where they are declared dead on arrival. Police say they’re trying to save lives. Bereaved relatives and other witnesses say police are sending corpses to hospitals to disrupt crime scenes and cover up extrajudicial killings. \nPolice were also ordered to limit the much-feared “Oplan Tokhang” operations, when they visit homes of users and dealers and seek their surrender, to between 8 a.m. and 5 p.m. (2400-1200 GMT) on weekdays, police spokesman Dionardo Carlos told a separate media briefing. \n“It has to be daytime, so as to erase the impression that if you have been the subject of Tokhang, you would be killed,” Carlos said, adding police would be required to wear their uniforms during such operations. \nThe Philippines has hit back at New York-based Human Rights Watch for what it called a misleading death toll of more than 12,000 in the drugs war, putting the number at half that.
