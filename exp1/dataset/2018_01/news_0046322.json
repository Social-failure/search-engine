(Nasdaq:LRCX) today announced financial results for the quarter ended December 24, 2017 (the “December 2017 quarter”).\nHighlights for the December 2017 quarter were as follows:\nShipments of $2.63 billion and revenue of $2.58 billion.\nU.S. GAAP gross margin of 46.7%, U.S. GAAP operating margin of 28.6%, and U.S. GAAP diluted EPS of $(0.06).\nNon-GAAP gross margin of 47.6%, non-GAAP operating margin of 30.2%, and non-GAAP diluted EPS of $4.34.\nKey Financial Data for the Quarters Ended\nDecember 24, 2017 and September 24, 2017\n(in thousands, except per-share data, percentages, and basis points)\nU.S. GAAP December 2017 September 2017 Change Q/Q Shipments $ 2,631,723 $ 2,381,565 11% Revenue $ 2,580,815 $ 2,478,140 + 4% Gross margin as percentage of revenue 46.7 % 46.4 % + 30 bps\nOperating margin as percentage of revenue 28.6 % 28.0 % + 60 bps\nDiluted EPS $ (0.06 ) $ 3.21 - 102% Non-GAAP December 2017 September 2017 Change Q/Q Shipments $ 2,631,723 $ 2,381,565 11% Revenue $ 2,580,815 $ 2,478,140 + 4% Gross margin as percentage of revenue 47.6 % 47.2 % + 40 bps Operating margin as percentage of revenue 30.2 % 29.6 % + 60 bps Diluted EPS $ 4.34 $ 3.46 + 25% U.S. GAAP Financial Results\nFor the December 2017 quarter, revenue was $2,581 million, gross margin was $1,206 million, or 46.7% of revenue, operating expenses were $468 million, operating margin was 28.6% of revenue, and net loss was $(10) million, or $(0.06) per diluted share on a U.S. GAAP basis. This compares to revenue of $2,478 million, gross margin of $1,149 million, or 46.4% of revenue, operating expenses of $456 million, operating margin of 28.0% of revenue, and net income of $591 million, or $3.21 per diluted share, for the quarter ended September 24, 2017 (the “September 2017 quarter”). The December 2017 results were negatively impacted by a one-time provisional charge of $757 million associated with the recently enacted U.S. tax reform, which the Company will continue to evaluate during the measurement period.\nNon-GAAP Financial Results\nFor the December 2017 quarter, non-GAAP gross margin was $1,228 million or 47.6% of revenue, non-GAAP operating expenses were $449 million, non-GAAP operating margin was 30.2% of revenue, and non-GAAP net income was $788 million, or $4.34 per diluted share. This compares to non-GAAP gross margin of $1,171 million or 47.2% of revenue, non-GAAP operating expenses of $438 million, non-GAAP operating margin of 29.6% of revenue, and non-GAAP net income of $628 million, or $3.46 per diluted share for the September 2017 quarter.\n“Lam delivered another record quarter to conclude an extraordinary calendar year where we reached new milestones including nearly ten billion dollars in shipments and over thirteen dollars in non-GAAP earnings per share,” said Martin Anstice, Lam Research’s Chief Executive Officer. “Semiconductor innovation is contributing increased value in a data-driven economy and we believe that trend is quite fundamental, exciting and sustainable: in 2018 we expect record levels of customer equipment spending and another year of outperformance opportunity for the company.”\nBalance Sheet and Cash Flow Results\nCash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, and restricted cash and investments balances decreased to $6.0 billion at the end of the December 2017 quarter compared to $6.4 billion at the end of the September 2017 quarter. Cash flow from operating activities during the December 2017 quarter total $29 million. Uses of cash during the quarter included: approximately $1,111 million of share repurchases, including net share settlement on employee stock-based compensation; approximately $206 million of purchases of available-for-sale securities, approximately $85 million of capital expenditures, and approximately $73 million of dividends paid to stockholders; partially offset by approximately $799 million of net proceeds on short-term borrowings.\nDeferred revenue at the end of the December 2017 quarter increased to $1.1 billion as compared to $938 million at the end of the September 2017 quarter. Deferred profit at the end of the December 2017 quarter increased to $749 million as compared to $598 million at the end of the September 2017 quarter. Lam’s deferred revenue balance does not include shipments to Japanese customers, to whom title does not transfer until customer acceptance. Shipments to Japanese customers are classified as inventory at cost until the time of acceptance. The estimated future revenue from shipments to Japanese customers was approximately $289 million as of December 24, 2017 and $344 million as of September 24, 2017.\nGeographic Distribution\nThe geographic distribution of shipments and revenue during the December 2017 quarter is shown in the following table:\nRegion Shipments Revenue Korea 32% 30% Taiwan 15% 15% Japan 14% 16% China 14% 11% United States 10% 11% Southeast Asia 10% 11% Europe 5% 6%\nOutlook\nFor the March 2018 quarter, Lam is providing the following guidance:\nU.S. GAAP Reconciling Items Non-GAAP Shipments $3.175 Billion +/- $125 Million — $3.175 Billion +/- $125 Million Revenue $2.850 Billion +/- $125 Million — $2.850 Billion +/- $125 Million Gross margin 45.2% +/- 1% $22 Million 46.0% +/- 1% Operating margin 27.6% +/- 1% $39 Million 29.0% +/- 1% Net income per diluted share $4.10 +/- $0.15 $37 Million $4.35 +/- $0.15 Diluted share count 183 Million 2 Million 181 Million The information provided above is only an estimate of what the Company believes is realizable as of the date of this release, and does not incorporate the potential impact of any business combinations, asset acquisitions, divestitures, balance sheet valuation adjustments, financing arrangements, other investments, measurement period adjustments associated with U.S. tax reform, or other significant transactions that may be completed after the date of this release. U.S. GAAP to non-GAAP reconciling items provided include only those items that are known and can be estimated as of the date of this release. Actual results will vary from this model and the variations may be material. Reconciling items included above are as follows:\nGross margin - amortization related to intangible assets acquired through business combinations, $22 million.\nOperating margin - amortization related to intangible assets acquired through business combinations, $39 million.\nEarnings per share - amortization related to intangible assets acquired though business combinations, $39 million; amortization of note discounts, $3 million; and associated tax benefit for non-GAAP items ($5 million); totaling $37 million.\nDiluted share count - impact of a note hedge issued contemporaneously with the convertible notes due 2018, 2 million shares.\nUse of Non-GAAP Financial Results\nIn addition to U.S. GAAP results, this press release also contains non-GAAP financial results. The Company’s non-GAAP results for both the December 2017 and September 2017 quarters exclude amortization related to intangible assets acquired through business combinations, costs associated with business process reengineering, acquisition and integration costs associated with a business combination, the amortization of note discounts, and tax benefit of non-GAAP items. Additionally, the December 2017 quarter results exclude estimated income tax expense associated with U.S. tax reform and the September 2017 quarter non-GAAP results exclude income tax benefit on the conclusion of tax matters related to a prior business combination.\nManagement uses non-GAAP gross margin, operating expense, operating income, operating margin, net income, and net income per diluted share to evaluate the Company’s operating and financial results. The Company believes the presentation of non-GAAP results is useful to investors for analyzing business trends and comparing performance to prior periods, along with enhancing investors’ ability to view the Company’s results from management’s perspective. Tables presenting reconciliations of non-GAAP results to U.S. GAAP results are included at the end of this press release and on the Company’s website at http://investor.lamresearch.com .\nCaution Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\nStatements made in this press release that are not of historical fact are and are subject to the safe harbor provisions created by the Private 1995.
