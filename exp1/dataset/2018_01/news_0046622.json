Many of the business leaders that I have met here have said they are buoyed by this new mood,” Ramaphosa said.\nOn the equities market, rand-hedge shares weighed on gains from the banking and financial sector.\nThe benchmark Top-40 index dipped 0.03 percent to 54,558 points while the All-Share index ticked up 0.1 percent to 61,685 points.\nBritish American Tobacco fell 2.59 percent to 829.74 rand, and bourse heavyweight Naspers dropped 1.41 percent to 3648.00 rand.\nFurther losses were curbed by risk-on sentiment in the banking sector, which rose 2.1 percent, and the financial sector, which lifted 1.16 percent.\nCratos Capital equities trader Greg Davies said: “Overseas investors are a little underweight in South Africa, and the first place they start buying is banks, financial and industrials.”\nGovernment bonds were broadly flat, with the yield on the 2026 benchmark instrument up one basis point to 8.435 percent.\nReporting by Alexander Winning and Tanisha Heiberg in Johannesburg and Alexis Akwagyiram in Davos, Editing by William Maclean\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-01-26T00:27:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-26T21:27:16.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
