The size of the protests is not large,” Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah said in an interview with Lebanon’s pro-Iran al-Mayadeen channel.\n“What is happening in Iran is being well contained and is not comparable with what happened in 2009 ... The problem in Iran now is not political like what happened in 2009.”\nNasrallah said the cause of the current protests was economic, sparked by the bankruptcy of some banks and companies. The resulting discontent was then exploited by external powers, he said.\n“America, Israel and Saudi Arabia have entered the crisis in Iran,” he said.\nWriting by Lisa Barrington; Reporting by Laila Bassam in Beirut and Omar Fahmy in Cairo, Editing by William Maclean\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-01-04T03:37:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-04T08:02:31.007+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
