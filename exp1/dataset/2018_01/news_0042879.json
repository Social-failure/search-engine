REUTERS/Jim Bourg TURN BACK THE CLOCK \nTo rewind the clock, scientists recommended Trump refrain from provocative rhetoric regarding North Korea, the two countries open multiple communication channels and the world community seek a cessation of North Korea’s nuclear weapon and ballistic missile tests. \nThe bulletin was founded by scientists who helped develop the United States’ first atomic weapons. Its Science and Security Board decides on the clock’s hands in consultation with its Board of Sponsors, which includes 15 Nobel laureates. \nWhen the clock was created in 1947, it was set at 7 minutes to midnight. \nLast year the clock’s hands were pushed forward 30 seconds to their second closest point to midnight - two minutes and 30 seconds - after Trump’s statements regarding the proliferation of nuclear weapons and the prospect of actually using them. \nIn 2016, the clock remained unmoved, its hands staying at three minutes to midnight. \nThe clock is displayed on the group's website thebulletin.org/ Reporting by Barbara Goldberg in New York; Editing by Andrew Hay", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-25T20:14:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-25T20:57:11.014+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
