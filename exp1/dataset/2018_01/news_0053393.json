Jason’s decision was not related to the business strategy or performance of Ford China,” Fleet said.\nFord said Luo’s replacement will be the “subject of a future announcement.” (Reporting by Norihiko Shirouzu; Editing by Jacqueline Wong)\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-29T06:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-29T06:13:02.040+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
