One kilo of hydrogen holds about 600 times more energy than a one-kilo lithium battery.\nPierre Forte (R), founder and CEO of Pragma Industries, and Alexandre Blanc (L), operations director, check an Alpha bike, first industrialised bicycle to use a hydrogen fuel cell at the Pragma Industries factory in Biarritz, France, January 15, 2018. REUTERS/Regis Duvignau Pragma also sells refueling stations that produce hydrogen through the electrolysis of water as well cheaper tank-based stations.\nThe bikes, which look and ride the same as any normal bicycle, are aimed at bike-rental operators, delivery companies, and municipal or corporate bicycle fleets with intensive usage.\nSlideshow (9 Images) Pragma, which produced 100 hydrogen bikes last year, plans to manufacture 150 this year. It has received demand from Norway, the United States, Spain, Italy and Germany, Forte said.\nWith bike’s range limited by the size of the hydrogen tank, Pragma is also working on a bike that will convert plain water into hydrogen aboard the bike, using a chemical reaction between water and aluminum or magnesium powder to produce hydrogen gas.\n“In the next two-three years we want to enter the consumer market and massively increase the scale of our operations,” said Forte.\nReporting by Geert De Clercq; editing by Luke Baker, William Maclean\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-16T19:52:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-16T20:08:56.032+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
