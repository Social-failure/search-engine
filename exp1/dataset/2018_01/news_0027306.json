The combined company will be Texas’ first truly integrated digital and traditional marketing agency, offering a complete suite of traditional, digital and social media services.\nThe new entity will operate as Integrate Agency and will be led by Wellington Group’s CEO, Robbie Wright, and Allie Danziger, serving as president. The joint company will be home to more than 30 professionals, providing clients a collective offering of traditional public relations, social media, community partnerships and marketing services, combined with website optimization, digital conversion, paid media, content, digital innovation and customer-first oriented design.\n“Integrate was founded on the premise of continuously evolving with the constantly emerging market trends, to offer clients the most cutting edge tactics that connect them with their target audiences most effectively,” said Danziger. “Ten years ago, we shook up the public relations scene by offering social media as a part of the traditional PR mix. Today, the marketing world has evolved again and, as our clients’ needs have shifted, so will we. Robbie and the Wellington team are the perfect group of entrepreneurial-minded partners to expand our collective offerings and provide clients the truly integrated marketing approach we know they need.”\nIntegrate will continue to operate towards its mission of providing clients with a full-service marketing solution that will change their businesses. This acquisition will allow for the creation and execution of an even more strategically-driven integration of public relations and digital marketing efforts.\n“Allie has a tremendous amount of talent and industry experience and I couldn’t be more excited about the chance to work with her and the Integrate team,” said Wright. “This acquisition more than doubles the size of our business and it also presents an opportunity to provide an unparalleled service to our client base thanks to the combined talent and experience of the Integrate and Wellington teams.”\nWellington is comprised of a leadership team who have created and exited multiple start-ups and bring a strong digital expertise to the business. While still offering core public relations, marketing and social media services, the company has brought in a digital team with a strong track record of growing businesses with more than 70 years combined digital marketing experience in website optimization, digital conversion, customer-first oriented design and development, paid media, digital innovation and operations.\nFor more information regarding Integrate Agency, please visit www.integrateagency.com .\nFor media inquiries, please contact Cristina Calderon at cristina@integrateagency.com or 713-225-0880 or Rachel Nieto at rachel@wellingtongrouppr.com or 281-206-4788.\nIntegrate Agency\nIntegrate Agency, an award-winning public relations and social media agency founded in 2009 by president and founder, Allie Danziger, specializes in curating public relations strategies to integrate social media, community relations, graphic design, and more to support its clients’ goals and effectively reach defined target audiences within the ever-evolving communications landscape.
