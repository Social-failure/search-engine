Slideshow (3 Images) \n“While we recognize many of our fans have a longstanding attachment to Chief Wahoo, I’m ultimately in agreement with Commissioner Manfred’s desire to remove the logo from our uniforms in 2019,” Cleveland Indians owner Paul Dolan said in the statement. \nThe logo, a smiling cartoon man with red skin and a feather in his headband, was at the center of a legal dispute in Canada when the team played the Toronto Blue Jays in the 2016 American League Champion Series. \nFollowing a claim that the logo, a staple on the team’s jerseys and caps, was offensive to indigenous people under Canadian law, a judge ultimately allowed the team to display its logo while playing in Toronto. \nThe Cleveland baseball club is not the only North American professional sports franchise to have long resisted calls for the removal of imagery depicting Native Americans. The National Hockey League’s Chicago Blackhawks, the National Football League’s Washington Redskins and MLB’s Atlanta Braves have faced similar criticism.
