The Fund's distribution will be payable on January 31, 2018 to shareholders of record on January 19, 2018. The ex-date for the Fund's distribution is January 18, 2018.\nIt is anticipated but not certain that approximately 100% of the Fund's distribution will be treated as a return of capital.

The Fund will invest no more than 25% of its total assets in securities of energy master limited partnerships (\"MLPs\") that qualify as publicly traded partnerships under the Internal Revenue Code.
