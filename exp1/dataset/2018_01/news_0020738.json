Soccer Football - Premier League - West Bromwich Albion vs Brighton & Hove Albion - The Hawthorns, West Bromwich, Britain - January 13, 2018 Brighton's Mathew Ryan gathers the ball from West Bromwich Albion's Jay Rodriguez REUTERS/Darren Staples \nThe pair exchanged words after they were involved in a flare-up during the second half. \nReferee Martin Atkinson consulted the fourth official, but played on without punishing Rodriguez. \n“There’s been an allegation made by the Brighton fullback to the referee and that allegation will go to the FA,” said Albion manager Alan Pardew. \n“I haven’t seen the incident. But knowing Jay Rodriguez I find it very difficult to understand if I‘m honest that there has been an allegation of any kind.” \nBrighton manager Chris Hughton said: ”Bong has reported Jay Rodriguez for something that was said to him. It’s being handled correctly by the ref. \n“He’s aware of the allegation and that will go through to the FA. It was something said to him and it is being dealt with in the correct manner.” Reporting by Neil Robinson; Editing by Christian Radnedge", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-13T21:49:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-13T22:02:45.029+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
