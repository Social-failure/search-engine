It shows the electric SUV pulling a semi truck on a snow-dusted street with the caption “5,000 lb towing limit, lol. Ben #ModelX #Tesla #TeslaSemi #Snow #DualMotor.” According to comments the driver was using Slip Start mode, which can help Model X drivers navigate certain difficult road conditions such as snow, gravel, or a deep rut. \nFortune contacted Spreen and Connor for more details about the car like what tires the SUV has and what type of Model X is depicted.
