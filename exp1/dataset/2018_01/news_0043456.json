The goal for Sycamore was to turn the struggling retailer around, with a bigger focus on serving a corporate market. \nStaples' business still has some bright spots and profitable segments, but its stores are increasingly threatened by the likes of Amazon and other retailers that sell less-expensive goods. \nStaples didn't immediately respond to CNBC's request for comment. Sycamore declined to comment. \nRead the full report from The Wall Street Journal .", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-26T18:09:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-26T18:09:32.024+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
