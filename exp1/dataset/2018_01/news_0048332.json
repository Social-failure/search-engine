So we need to respond appropriately.”\nBank of Japan Governor Haruhiko Kuroda told reporters in Davos on Thursday there was a shared agreement among Group of Seven advanced economies that currency rates should move stably reflecting economic fundamentals, Kyodo news agency reported.\nAso welcomed Trump’s remark made in an interview in Davos that the United States would stay in the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) if American negotiators were able to create a better agreement.\nSince Trump pulled his country out of the TPP a year ago, Japan has worked with 10 other remaining members to create a high level free-trade zone in the region, Aso said.\n“It’s no surprise that the United States takes that into account, as we were originally working together. The fact that the United States has such intention should be welcomed.”\nReporting by Tetsushi Kajimoto; Editing by Chris Gallagher & Simon Cameron-Moore\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-01-26T09:11:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-26T11:26:22.015+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
