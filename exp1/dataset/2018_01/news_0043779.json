Australian markets will be closed on Friday for a public holiday. \nLarge-capped lenders National Australia Bank Ltd and Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Ltd finished the session 0.6 percent and 0.5 percent lower, respectively. \nToll road developer Transurban Group fell 1.1 percent, while steel manufacturer BlueScope Steel Ltd slipped 2.1 percent to a five-week low. \nTaking the sting out of the broad market, global miner BHP Billiton - which has a sizable exposure to oil - rose 0.6 percent to end at its highest in over a week. \nBrent oil prices hit $71 per barrel for the first time since 2014 as the dollar slumped to a three-year low and crude inventories in the United States fell for a 10th straight week. \nThe weaker dollar pushed gold prices to their strongest since August 2016, lifting Newcrest Mining Ltd 2.2 percent and the gold index past a one-week top. \nNew Zealand’s benchmark S&P/NZX 50 index rose 0.55 percent or 45.69 points to finish the session at 8,369.78 - its best close since Jan. 9. \nEquity investors were likely encouraged by consumer prices rising at a slower-than-expected pace in the fourth quarter, meaning the central bank will be in no hurry to raise interest rates. \nDairy firm a2 Milk Company Ltd pushed higher to fresh records, up 2.4 percent, while telco Spark New Zealand Ltd rose 1.7 percent.
