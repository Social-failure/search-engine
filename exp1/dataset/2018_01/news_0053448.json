Headcount is expected to remain stable. \nSeparately the City of London Corporation, the municipal authority for the capital’s “Square Mile” financial district, said nearly one in every five workers there in 2016 came from a European country, the highest on record. \nEighteen percent of the City’s workforce came from the European Economic Area, up from 8 percent a decade earlier. UK workers accounted for 59 percent of staff, the rest came from outside Europe. \n“This data crystalizes the importance of European workers to the UK’s biggest financial centre, and the need for a clear post-Brexit immigration policy,” City of London policy chief Catherine McGuinness said. \nThe CBI/PwC said that 54 percent of the 92 firms they surveyed said they want to make it easier to attract staff to Britain’s financial technology or fintech sector.
