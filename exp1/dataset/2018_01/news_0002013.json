It’s not known whether criminals have been able to carry out such attacks as neither Meltdown nor Spectre leave any traces in log files.\nIntel says it has started providing software and firmware updates to mitigate the security issues. ARM has also said it was working with AMD and Intel on security fixes.\nFINDING A FIX The discovery was originally reported by online tech journal The Register. As a result of that report, research on the defect was published a week earlier than the manufacturers had planned, before some had time to work out a complete fix.\nThe Graz team had already been working on a tool to defend against attempts to steal secrets from kernel memory.\nIn a paper presented last June they called it KAISER, or Kernel Address Isolation to have Side-channels Effectively Removed.\nThe Intel logo is displayed on computer screens at SIGGRAPH 2017 in Los Angeles, California, U.S. July 31, 2017. REUTERS/Mike Blake As the name suggests, KAISER seeks to defend the kernel memory from a so-called side-channel attack that exploits a design feature of modern processors that increases their speed.\nThis involves processors executing tasks “out-of-order”, and not in the sequence received. If the CPU makes the right speculative call, time is saved. Get it wrong and the out-of-order task is cancelled and no time is lost.\nResearcher Anders Fogh wrote in a subsequent blog that it might be possible to abuse so-called speculative execution in order to read kernel memory. He was not able to do so in practice, however. ( bit.ly/2vpkut0 )\nRESPONSIBLE DISCLOSURE Only after the December self-hacking episode did the significance of Graz team’s earlier work become clear. It turned out that the KAISER tool presented an effective defence against Meltdown.\nThe team quickly got in touch with Intel and learned that other researchers - inspired in part by Fogh’s blog - had made similar discoveries.\nThey were working under so-called responsible disclosure, where researchers inform affected companies of their findings to give them time to prepare ‘patches’ to repair flaws they have exposed.\nThe key players were independent researcher Paul Kocher and the team at a company called Cyberus Technology, said Gruss, while Jann Horn at Google Project Zero came to similar conclusions independently.\n\"We merged our efforts in mid-December with the team around Paul Kocher and the people from Cyberus Technology to work on two solid publications on Meltdown and Spectre,\" said Gruss. ( www.meltdownattack.com )\nGruss had not even been aware of the work Horn was doing. ( here )\n“Jann Horn developed all of this independently - that’s incredibly impressive,” he said. “We developed very similar attacks, but we were a team of 10 researchers.”\nThe wider team said patches for Meltdown, based on KAISER, had been readied for Microsoft Corp and Apple Inc operating systems, as well as for the Linux open-source system.\nThere is as yet no fix for Spectre, which tricks programmes into leaking their secrets but is viewed as a harder exploit for a hacker to carry out.\nAsked which of the two flaws posed the greater challenge, Gruss said: ”The immediate problem is Meltdown.\n“After that it is going to be Spectre. Spectre is more difficult to exploit but also to mitigate. So in the long run I’d bet on Spectre.”\n(This story has been refiled to remove incorrect detail on name given to app in paragraph 13, amends detail about blog in paragraph 17.)\nEditing by Georgina Prodhan and Edmund Blair\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-04T19:17:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-04T19:34:09.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
