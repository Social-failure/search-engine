This work includes existing initiatives and new work in both Ohio and upstate New York— work made possible by the KeyBank Business Boost & Build Program, a JumpStart-powered program funded via a historic $24M grant from the KeyBank Foundation.\nAs part of this expanded work, JumpStart's Gloria Ware will serve in a new role as the founding Director of The KeyBank Center for Technology, Innovation and Inclusive Growth. This new center is an important piece of the larger KeyBank Boost & Build Program, designed specifically to accelerate the success of women and minorities as entrepreneurs of high growth firms, while connecting women, minorities and those in rural communities across Ohio to career opportunities in growing, globally competitive small businesses.\n\"This is an exciting and important time for JumpStart,\" said Ware of her new role. \"The success of our previous work has now earned us an opportunity to expand our reach and help transform more communities by helping more entrepreneurs and small business owners connect to economic opportunity. We look forward to meeting the challenge.\"\n\"JumpStart's senior leadership team and board of directors interviewed top candidates from across the country, and we were unanimous in concluding Erin is the right person for this role,\" added JumpStart CEO Ray Leach. \"With Erin's leadership and Gloria at the helm of The KeyBank Center for Technology, Innovation and Inclusive Growth, we are very excited for what we will be able to help entrepreneurs and communities accomplish in generating greater inclusive economic growth in the years to come.\"\nJUMPSTART INC. unlocks the full potential of diverse and ambitious entrepreneurs to economically transform entire communities.
