But police insist suspects died because they violently resisted arrest. \nNearly 4,000 drug suspects have died in gun battles with police since June 2016, when Duterte came to power. The government lost 85 police and soldiers in the drugs war, police data show. \nMore than 1.2 million people had also turned themselves in after the home visits. \nDuterte has stopped police anti-drugs operations twice due to questions over the conduct of the force. \nTo ensure transparency, Dela Rosa invited human rights advocates, priests and the media to join the relaunched programme of home visits. \nThe police officers involved would also undergo a vetting process to weed out “rogue” officers, said Dela Rosa, adding that past abuses had involved the police seeking bribes to drop the names of people from the lists they compiled. \n“We are certainly hoping that it will be less controversial, because controversy will only blur the real intention, which is really the fight against dangerous drugs,” Harry Roque, Duterte’s spokesman, told a regular media briefing.
