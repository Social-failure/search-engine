Some states argue that this language does not make it obligatory.\nIran has denied that it has missiles designed to carry nuclear warheads.\nLe Drian said he would also raise what he called Iran’s “destabilizing military influence in the Middle East”, notably its support for Lebanon’s Hezbollah and Yemen’s Houthi militias.\nWith Trump warning of a last chance for “the worst deal ever negotiated”, Britain, France and Germany have begun talks on a plan to satisfy him by addressing Iran’s ballistic missile tests and its regional influence while preserving the 2015 accord.\nReporting by Geert De Clercq and John Irish; Editing by Elaine Hardcastle\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-22T00:29:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-22T03:01:51.139+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
