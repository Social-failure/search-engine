In this role, Dr. Tang led the transformation of the Science Center into a world-class, global innovation hub for the life sciences industry, focusing on the development and commercialization of innovative technologies and products.\nPrior to that, Dr. Tang was the Group Vice President and General Manager, Life Sciences of Olympus America, Inc., where he ran the Life Science group at Olympus with leading brands in instrumentation and total solutions for in vitro diagnostics, microscopes and micro-imaging, and enabling technologies for translational and personalized medicine.

Patrick, Chairman of the Company’s Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee. \"Steve’s vast technical and business experience, both in the private sector and as a public company CEO, and particularly his long and successful track record in developing and commercializing innovative technologies in the life sciences area, make him the ideal executive to lead OraSure into the future. With his service on the Board for the past six years, Steve also has an intimate knowledge of the Company and its strategic priorities and has developed strong relationships with the management team. We look forward to working with Steve in his new role as CEO and are confident that he will be successful in building on the Company’s strong business momentum.\"\n“Although he is not retiring for several months, I would also like to thank Doug Michels, on behalf of the Board and the Company, for his many years of leadership and service,” continued Mr. Patrick. “Since Doug joined OraSure in 2004, we have achieved many significant milestones and the Company has grown substantially from revenues of approximately $40 million in 2003 to more than $165 million projected for 2017 and from a market capitalization of approximately $352 million in 2003 to $1.1 billion at the end of 2017. Many of our products were the first of their kind to receive regulatory approval and be commercialized and our expansion into the high growth molecular market has greatly contributed to our business. These achievements were due in no small measure to Doug’s vision and leadership. We wish Doug, his wife, Susan, and his family nothing but good health and much happiness in their retirement.”\nCFO/COO Retirement\nRonald H.
