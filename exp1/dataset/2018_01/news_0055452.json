It fell back to 3.0 percent in December.\nData published last week showed Britain’s economy performed better than the BoE expected at the end of last year although it still lagged behind stronger growth in many other rich countries due in large part to the impact of the 2016 Brexit vote.\nEconomists mostly expect the next BoE rate hike in the second half of 2018 but some think it could move as soon as May.\nThe BoE is due to make its latest assessment of Britain’s economy on Feb. 8.\nIn Tuesday’s question-and-answer session in the House of Lords, Carney defended the forecasts made by the BoE before the Brexit referendum about what was likely to happen to the economy in the event of a vote to leave.\n“We got the broad economic channels right,” Carney said\nSome Brexit supporters have criticised Carney for the BoE’s prediction that a vote to leave the EU could cause a “material slowing” in Britain’s economy. Carney said at the time that it might even cause a short recession.
