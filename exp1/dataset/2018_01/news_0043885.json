On Tuesday, Marston said business during Christmas was marred by snowy and icy weather.\nShares of Greene King fell 1.2 percent to 520.2 pence at 0806 GMT.\nHowever, Greene King, which brews ales such as Greene King IPA, Old Speckled Hen and Abbot Ale, said comparable sales in the two weeks covering Christmas and New Year’s eve rose 1.6 percent.\nExcluding the bad weather, like-for-like sales in the two-week period would have been up 3.4 percent, the company said.\n“Either side of the two Christmas weeks sales were slower, reflecting the tough underlying trading environment and additional snow impact”, the company said.\nGreene King also said it remained on track to cut costs of 40-45 million pounds this year.\nThe Suffolk-based brewer has been battling rising costs due to the government’s National Living Wage initiative, higher property prices and unfavourable currency exchange rate.
