Chinese mainland shares rose 0.8 percent, closing at a 30-month high, while index heavyweight South Korea gained 0.7 percent.\n“We are seeing a lot of inflows to the EM asset class while the dollar has got weaker and weaker, which is supportive for emerging markets as a whole,” said Trieu Pham, a strategist at MUFG. “So far, there has been nothing to change the (bullish) view on EM.”\nIn another sign of the sector’s health, emerging markets fund manager Ashmore posted a 7 percent rise in second- quarter assets under management, boosted by net inflows and investment gains.\nThe rally extended into some emerging European markets with Hungarian shares up 0.6 percent and Polish stocks up 0.3 percent.\nWith the dollar index down 0.4 percent to its lowest in more than three years, some currencies also gained.\nAmongst the biggest gainers was the South African rand which rose as much as 0.8 percent, breaking through a technical barrier to hit a 2 1/2-year high against the dollar.\nInvestors have been eyeing reports that the ruling African National Congress party is preparing to discuss whether President Jacob Zuma should step down as head of state. Any sign that Zuma might go early has lifted South African assets .\n“There are definitely upside risks to the currency due to the rumours, again and again, that Zuma will be removed,” said Pham. “Markets have been disappointed in this before, but still the police are targeting (businessmen) the Guptas, and (new ANC leader Cyril) Ramaphosa’s focus is on the economy and corruption.”\nChina’s yuan was also still trading near its strongest in more than two years after surging on Monday, underpinned by the Bundesbank’s decision to include the yuan in its reserves.\nBut the Turkish lira weakened 0.6 percent towards its lowest in close to a month, pressured by threats from President Tayyip Erdogan to “strangle” a planned U.S.-backed force in Syria.\nThe Indian rupee also fell 0.9 percent to a two-week low, hit by higher oil prices. India’s trade deficit widened to its highest in more than three years in December.\nIn emerging Europe, the Romanian leu weakened 0.4 percent against the euro and stocks fell 0.5 percent after Prime Minister Mihai Tudose resigned. The ruling party meets later on Tuesday to discuss a replacement.\nUkraine’s dollar bonds fell across the curve after the International Monetary Fund expressed concern that a draft law to create an anti-corruption court would not guarantee the new body’s independence.\nFor GRAPHIC on emerging market FX performance 2017, see tmsnrt.rs/2e7eoml For GRAPHIC on MSCI emerging index performance 2017, see tmsnrt.rs/2dZbdP5\nFor CENTRAL EUROPE market report, see\nFor TURKISH market report, see\nFor RUSSIAN market report, see) Emerging Markets Prices from Reuters Equities Latest Net Chg % Chg % Chg\non year\nMorgan Stanley Emrg Mkt Indx 1217.61 +6.97 +0.58 +5.11\nCzech Rep 1112.90 +3.81 +0.34 +3.22\nPoland 2547.36 +4.71 +0.19 +3.50\nHungary 39837.74 +258.63 +0.65 +1.17\nRomania 8215.29 -39.56 -0.48 +5.95\nGreece 849.21 +1.48 +0.17 +5.84\nRussia 1252.86 -11.44 -0.90 +8.53\nSouth Africa 53669.23 +237.70 +0.44 +2.16\nTurkey 12553.07 +393.86 +0.35 -2.41\nChina 3437.48 +27.00 +0.79 +3.94\nIndia 34774.81 -68.70 -0.20 +2.11\nCurrencies Latest Prev Local Local\nclose currency currency\n% change % change\nin 2018\nCzech Rep 25.51 25.52 +0.05 +0.06\nPoland 4.18 4.17 -0.18 -0.06\nHungary 308.85 308.65 -0.06 +0.54\nRomania 4.66 4.64 -0.41 +0.47\nSerbia 118.34 118.09 -0.21 +0.05\nRussia 56.38 56.32 -0.12 +2.26\nKazakhstan 327.61 328.99 +0.42 +1.58\nUkraine 28.64 28.56 -0.28 -1.73\nSouth Africa 12.24 12.29 +0.41 +0.96\nKenya 103.00 102.90 -0.10 +0.10\nIsrael 3.41 3.40 -0.24 +2.08\nTurkey 3.82 3.80 -0.43 -0.71\nChina 6.44 6.44 -0.00 +1.11\nIndia 64.05 63.51 -0.84 -0.34\nBrazil 3.22 3.22 +0.00 +2.98\nMexico 18.85 18.85 -0.01 +4.24\nDebt Index Strip Spd Chg %Rtn Index\nSov‘gn Debt EMBIG 299 1 .05 8 08.76 1\nReporting by Claire Milhench,; additional reporting by Sujata Rao, graphic by Karin Strohecker, editing by Larry King\n ", "external_links": ["http://tmsnrt.rs/2dZbdP5", "http://tmsnrt.rs/2e7eoml", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-01-16T18:40:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-17T20:13:17.001+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
