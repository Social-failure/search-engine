It can’t be that this is happening for the first time,” Bajaj told Reuters. \n“The AIFF needs to deal with it very seriously as it can destroy the integrity and reputation of the sport in the country.” \n($1 = 63.5350 Indian rupees)", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-29T10:31:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-29T10:54:22.025+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
