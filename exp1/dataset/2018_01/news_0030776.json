Slideshow (2 Images) \nA seven-member North Korean team had been scheduled to visit on Saturday to check venues for the performances, the ministry said, but late on Friday North Korea cancelled the visit. \nAt the Games, the two Koreas will field a combined women’s ice hockey team and march together under one flag, Seoul said earlier this week, after a new round of talks amid a thaw in cross-border ties. \nMeanwhile, North Korea has accused the United Nations Secretary General of bias over its nuclear tests and ballistic missile launches for not also taking the United States to task over its own nuclear programme. The North criticised the U.S. and other nations for calling its nuclear programme “violations of resolutions”. \nPyongyang said the remarks it took issue with were in the vein of “the U.S. desperately trying to reverse the trend of detente and improvement of inter-Korean relations”, seemingly referring to the breakthrough surrounding the Winter Olympics, according to a statement from North Korea’s Permanent Mission to the UN.
