You can’t have a business where people can invent a currency out of thin air and think that people who are buying it are really smart,” he had said.\nSeveral banks, exchange operators and companies have embraced bitcoins, fuelled by increasing consumer and investor interest.\nBitcoin was down nearly 2 percent at $14,786 in early trading on Tuesday. It traded at $909 a year ago and breached $19,000 in December.\nDimon made the comments at the JPMorgan Health Care Conference in San Francisco.
