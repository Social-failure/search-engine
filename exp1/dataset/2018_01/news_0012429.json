The left-handed batter hit .332 in 2017 and has slugged 48 home runs in 1,035 career at-bats. \nOhtani’s two-way ability has prompted comparisons with Hall of Famer Babe Ruth, who hit a combined 40 home runs while batting .312 for the Boston Red Sox in 1918 and 1919. \nRuth also had a 2.55 ERA before he became a fulltime outfielder after being traded to the New York Yankees.
