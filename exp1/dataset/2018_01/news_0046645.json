That compares with averages of $50.85 in 2017 and $43.47 in 2016. \nLooking ahead, futures were trading around $64 for the balance of 2018 and $59 for calendar 2019. \nIn anticipation of higher prices in 2018 than 2017, U.S. financial services firm Cowen & Co said 26 of the roughly 65 E&Ps they track, including EP Energy Corp, have already provided capital expenditure guidance for 2018 indicating a 7 percent increase in planned spending over 2017. \nEP Energy said it would boost capital spending to $600-$650 million in 2018, up about 9 percent from the $550-$600 million it planned to spend in 2017. \nCowen said the E&Ps it tracks planned to spend about $66.1 billion on drilling and completions in the lower 48 U.S. states in 2017, about 53 percent over what they planned to spend in 2016. \nAnalysts at Simmons & Co, energy specialists at U.S. investment bank Piper Jaffray, last week forecast the total oil and natural gas rig count would average 1,004 in 2018 and 1,128 in 2019. \nThere were 947 oil and natural gas rigs active on Jan. 26. On average, there were 876 rigs available for service in 2017, 509 in 2016 and 978 in 2015. Most rigs produce both oil and gas.
