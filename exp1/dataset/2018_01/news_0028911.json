The latter are not part of Moon’s main support base and tend to be more conservative in South Korea’s political landscape. \nMoon was elected to office in May last year with a high approval rating after his predecessor, Park Geun-hye, was removed from office over a corruption scandal. \nThe latest poll of 1,005 adults, was conducted this week from Tuesday to Thursday this week and has a margin of error of plus minus 3.1 percent.
