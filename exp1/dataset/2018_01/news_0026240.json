Throughput was 266,599 tonnes at 15.3 g/t with operating time of 96%. Notably, throughputs increased quarter on quarter indicating increased stability and reliability of the circuit.\nRoxgold's closing cash balance was approximately $64 million 3 and long-term debt face value balance of $47 million 3 as of December 31, 2017.\nRoxgold expects to release its fourth quarter and full year 2017 financial results on March 28, 2018. The Company's 2017 Cash Operating cost 1 per ounce and All-in-Sustaining cost 1 per ounce will be reported at that time and is expected to be within guidance.\nHealth and Safety in 2017\nThere were no lost time injuries (\"LTI\") during the fourth quarter, or in the full calendar year for 2017. In 2017, there were 2.1 million LTI free hours worked, with a total of 4 million LTI free hours worked as at December 31, 2017.\n2018 Operational Outlook\nRoxgold anticipates its 2018 annual gold production at Yaramoko to be between 110,000 and 120,000 ounces in 2018.\n2018 Estimated Costs\nCash operating cost (per ounce produced) 1\n$450 - $500\nAll-in sustaining cost (per ounce sold) 1\n$780 - $830\nUnderground capital expenditure\n$22 million - $26 million\nBagassi South pre-production capital expenditure\n$30 million\nExploration budget\n$9 million\nThe mine is expected to produce slightly stronger quarters in Q2 and Q3. In addition, 2018 is expected to see a greater proportion of the mill feed met by stoping activities as opposed to ore development. Grades from the mine are expected to be in line with those seen in 2017 with an average of 13.7 g/t Au expected across the year.\nIn Q3 and Q4, the processing plant tie-ins for the Bagassi South expansion are expected to occur, slightly affecting mill operating time in those periods; however, it is planned that these exercises will largely occur within planned maintenance stoppages.\nNotes:\n1\nThis is a non-IFRS Financial performance measure with no standard definition under IFRS.
