Wennberg also had a power-play goal to go with his assist on the game-winner.\nRaanta had 25 saves for Arizona, which saw its two-game winning streak end. Left winger Brendan Perlini scored his 14th goal of the season and fourth in four games for the Coyotes.\nWennberg broke a scoreless tie at 79 seconds into the third period with his fifth goal of the season, deflecting a slap shot by Jones from the slot.\nPerlini tied it with a power-play goal at 7:39 with a wrist shot from his knees into the right side of the net during a goal-mouth scramble. Columbus challenged for goaltender interference as several bodies fell into the crease, but the goal stood.\nThat set the stage for Atkinson’s game-winner. Atkinson finished with four shots, three hits, two blocks and a takeaway in 19:09 of ice time.\nWith the victory, Columbus heads into the All-Star break in second place in the Metropolitan Division, six points behind the Washington Capitals. Arizona owns the lowest points total in the NHL.\n--Field Level Media\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-01-26T13:17:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-26T21:20:12.046+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
