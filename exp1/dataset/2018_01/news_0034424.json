The Cavs led 43-28 with 12 minutes to play, after a Hall 3-pointer and layup from Guy. Virginia maintained a double-digit lead the rest of the way and snapped Georgia Tech’s four-game winning streak.\nTadric Jackson scored 14 points to lead the Yellow Jackets (10-8, 3-2 ACC). No other Georgia Tech players reached double figures against the Virginia defense, which ranks No. 1 in the nation in points allowed.\nThe Yellow Jackets were the eighth opponent to be held to less than 50 points by Virginia, which forced 18 Georgia Tech turnovers.\nPoints were hard to come by from the start. The Yellow Jackets managed just one field goal in the first eight minutes and fell behind early.\nHunter scored 10 of his points in the first half, and Virginia went into halftime with a 28-19 lead.\nHunter, who came off the bench, also grabbed a team-high seven rebounds for Virginia.\nJosh Okogie, Georgia Tech’s leading scorer, was held to nine points. Okogie entered the game averaging 18.8 points per game.\nThe Cavaliers’ only loss came at West Virginia on Dec. 5. Virginia has responded with nine straight wins and is the only unbeaten team in ACC play. The schedule is getting ready to get tougher, though.\nThe Cavs travel to Wake Forest on Sunday, before taking on No. 20 Clemson and No. 5 Duke next week.\nThe Yellow Jackets went 1-5 during a three-week stretch in December, but turned things around in conference play. They had wins over Miami, Notre Dame and Pittsburgh, before running into Virginia.\nGeorgia Tech is at No. 15 North Carolina on Saturday.\n--Field Level Media\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-01-19T11:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-19T12:42:29.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
