Republicans have so far refused.\n  scheduled a key procedural vote on the bill for 10 p.m. (0300 GMT) and Democratic and Republican lawmakers huddled to see if either side was ready to back down or if they could find a compromise.\nEven as they talked, both sides were blaming each other for the impasse. Without a late deal, the shutdown would begin right after midnight, on the first anniversary of President Donald Trump's inauguration.\nTrump met with Senate   at the White House earlier on Friday in search of a breakthrough.\n\"Making progress - four week extension would be best,\" Trump said in a tweet.\nSchumer agreed that some progress had been made but said there were still a number of disagreements.\nThe Republican-controlled House of Representatives approved a stopgap spending bill late on Thursday that would fund the federal government through Feb. 16. But it needs the support of at least 10 Democrats to pass the Senate.\nWhite House budget director Mick Mulvaney said he expected an agreement would be reached in the next 24 hours, indicating   shut down at midnight but reopen again at some point over the weekend.\nPast government shutdowns have done little lasting damage to the U.S. economy, but put hundreds of thousands of \"non-essential\" federal workers on temporary unpaid leave. Shutdowns can also rattle financial markets.\n\"Essential\" employees who deal with public safety and national security would keep working under a shutdown. That includes more than 1.3 million people on active duty in the military who would be required to keep working and would not be paid until the shutdown ends.\nThe White House said on Friday night that it would keep national parks open, with rangers and security guards on duty as usual something the administration of President Barack Obama ruled out during the last significant shutdown in 2013.\nDuring that impasse, government funding lapsed for 16 full days and about 800,000 federal workers were put on temporary leave.\nThis week's showdown follows a months-long struggle in Congress to agree on government funding levels and the immigration issue.\nThe federal government is operating on a third temporary funding measure since the current fiscal year began in October.\nPROTECTION FOR \"DREAMERS\"\nDemocrats have demanded the bill include protections from deportation for about 700,000 illegal immigrants who were brought into the United States as children.\nKnown as \"Dreamers\" and largely from Mexico and Central America, these immigrants were given temporary legal status under the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program started by Obama. In September, Trump announced he was ending the program and giving Congress until March 5 to come up with a legislative replacement.\nTrump pointed the finger at his political rivals earlier on Friday.\n\"Democrats are needed if it is to pass in the Senate - but they want illegal immigration and weak borders. Shutdown coming?\" he said.\nDemocrats say the search for a deal has been hurt by Trump's sending contradictory messages about what kind of bipartisan immigration proposal he would accept.\nRepublican Senator Tom Cotton said he was willing to provide protection to DACA recipients in future negotiations.\n\"We have another six weeks to solve that problem. It doesn't really involve government funding,\" Cotton told Fox News. \"We should take those two issues up in sequence.\"\nRepublicans have a 51-49 majority in the Senate. With Senator John McCain undergoing cancer treatment at home in Arizona, Republicans need at least 10 Democrats to reach the 60 votes required to pass a spending bill.\nThere were some dissident voices inside both parties.\nAt least three Republican senators have said they will not back the resolution in its current form. On the other side, at least three Democrats who are up for re-election this year in states Trump won in the 2016 presidential election said they would support the bill.\nSome senators raised the possibility of merely approving enough new federal funds for a few days, as a tactic to put pressure on negotiators to then cut deals on immigration, defense spending and non-defense funding by next week.\nBut a White House aide said late on Friday that Trump would not support a deal that keeps the government open for just four or five days.\nMcConnell also shot down the idea. \"Let's fund the government for a full month so we can actually get something done,\" he said.
