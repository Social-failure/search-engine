NYSE also competes against IEX Group and the Chicago Stock Exchange.\nNYSE closed its deal to buy the National Stock Exchange Inc on Jan. 31, 2017 and then shuttered the exchange on Feb. 1. Since then NYSE has shifted the exchange over its trading technology platform Pillar.\nNYSE has said it would seek input from the trading industry before finalizing operational plans for NYSE Nationalâ€™s launch.\nReporting by John McCrank; Editing by Sandra Maler\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-01-17T05:40:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-16T23:48:47.107+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
