Stimulants like Adderall and Ritalin are among the most commonly prescribed medications for the condition, and these drugs are increasingly being used by women of childbearing age. \nAll of the women in the current study had health insurance through Medicaid, the U.S. benefits program for the poor. \nAmong children of women who were not taking stimulants for ADHD, 35 out of every 1,000 babies had birth defects, compared with 46 out of every 1,000 infants born to women using drugs like Ritalin. \nTo assess whether these results were unique to the U.S. or to women on Medicaid, researchers also examined health registry data for more than 2.5 million pregnancies in Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway and Sweden. \nIn the Nordic data, drugs like Ritalin were also associated with a 28 percent higher risk of heart malformations in babies. \nThe study wasn’t a controlled experiment designed to prove whether or how specific ADHD drugs might cause birth defects. \nBecause the study only included live births, it didn’t explore whether the drugs might increase the risks of severe birth defects that lead to miscarriage or stillbirths or that prompt women to terminate pregnancies, the authors note. \n“If a woman has mild symptoms, it might be possible to avoid use of the medicine during pregnancy,” said Dr. William Cooper, a researcher at Vanderbilt University Medical Center in Nashville, Tennessee, who wasn’t involved in the study but wrote an accompanying editorial. \n“However, if the woman has severe symptoms that interfere with her daily function, the results of this study can help to guide decisions on whether to continue,” Cooper said by email. \nIt may also make sense for some women with ADHD to consider stopping or changing medications when they’re trying to conceive, Huybrechts said. \n“Considering the high rate of unplanned pregnancies among young women, the potential for accidental exposure is also very high,” Huybrechts said. “Although the absolute risk is small, it is nevertheless important evidence to consider when weighing the potential risks and benefits of different treatment strategies for ADHD in young women of reproductive age and in pregnant women.” \nSOURCES: bit.ly/2m33rry and bit.ly/2qubOB0 JAMA Psychiatry, online December 13, 2017.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-05T23:10:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-05T23:46:57.023+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
