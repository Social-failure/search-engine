Both parties can withdraw from the treaty, which would mean a return to hard national borders, a move that would symbolically cut Britain off from the continent just as it is implementing Brexit. BREXIT IMPACT \nPro-Brexit lawmakers from Britain’s governing Conservative Party have dismissed as “absurd” suggestions that London should pay more, saying Britain already provides extra security to France, including border infrastructure.

Far-right groups, which have gained ground in Hauts-de-France, point out that asylum applications touched 100,000 in 2017, a new high. \nMacron struck a tough tone in response, saying he would punish excessive use of force by police if proven true, but dismissed some of the allegations as “lies” and said the government would sue for slander any unfounded claim. \nMeeting migrants from Sudan who had reached France via Italy and Libya, Macron sympathised with their plight and said France needed to find a balance between humanitarian care and a firm application of the law. \n“We have a responsibility to protect those who are in danger,” he was quoted as saying by BFMTV. “(But) we can’t welcome millions of people who live in peace in their countries.” Reporting by Marine Pennetier in Calais;   Matthias Blamont and Michel Rose in Paris; Writing by Luke Baker; Editing by Richard Lough and Alison Williams", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-16T13:05:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-16T13:27:35.006+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
