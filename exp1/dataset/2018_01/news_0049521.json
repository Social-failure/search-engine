But this wasn’t sustained and the spread between the HK dollar and U.S. rates widened, he said. INFLOWS FROM CHINA \nSpreads between the Hong Kong Interbank Offered Rate (HIBOR) and LIBOR widened sharply last year as markets priced in steadily rising U.S. rates. \nThat spread “is still wide at around 1 percent for overnight contracts, which has triggered a lot of arbitrage trades that long the U.S. dollar and short the Hong Kong dollar,” said Ngan Kim Man, deputy treasury head at China Everbright Bank’s Hong Kong branch. \nThough the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) followed suit with the U.S. Federal Reserve’s rate hikes, liquidity in Hong Kong market remains sufficient. \nRaymond Yeung, ANZ’s Greater China chief economist, sees “quite strong” inflows to Hong Kong’s exchange from the mainland as one factor. \nThis year, the Hang Seng index is up around 10 percent and the H-share index of China firms has gained nearly 18 percent. \nThe last time the HKMA issued an additional Exchange Fund Bill (EFB), used to drain liquidity, was Oct. 24. In November, the Hong Kong dollar bounced to 7.7922, its strongest level in five months. \nAsked why it doesn’t sell an additional EFB as the Hong Kong dollar is quite weak, an HKMA spokeswoman replied that such issuance was to meet strong demand from banks and “had nothing to do with movements of the HKD exchange rate”. \n($1 = 7.8171 Hong Kong dollars) Reporting by Michelle Chen; Editing by Richard Borsuk", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-29T09:42:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-29T10:23:45.036+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
