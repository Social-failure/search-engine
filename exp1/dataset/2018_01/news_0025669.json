He did not know if the driver’s epilepsy fit had been confirmed.\nWitnesses said on the Globo News network that the racing car shot over a bicycle path and across the sidewalk, hitting people and crashing through tables and chairs, before coming to a stop on the sand of the beach. The smashed widescreen and dented roof indicated the force with which the vehicle had hit people.\nThe sidewalk of the Copacabana crescent-shaped beach is a favorite summer evening walk for Rio residents and tourists that have begun to arrive in Rio ahead of Carnival celebrations next month.\nReporting by Anthony Boadle; Editing by Sandra Maler\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-19T04:33:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-19T04:49:26.008+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
