Weinstein has denied having non-consensual sex with anyone. \nThe PGA expelled Weinstein from the group in October. \nThe new guidelines are especially important for independent productions that are not being done at a movie or TV studio with a human resources department, McCreary said in an interview. \nLucchesi said the steps, which were unanimously ratified by the PGA’s board of directors, are meant to serve as “best practices” for the PGA’s 8,200 members. \n“It’s really about setting the right tone and having the proper behaviour,” he said. “You don’t want people to be insensitive anymore.” \nThe recommendations also offer advice to victims of harassment, starting with going to authorities if they believe a crime was committed, and taking notes shortly after an incident.
