It is also grappling to eliminate bottlenecks that can happen when users of its industry-leading mobile app flood crowded cafes with orders.\nStarbucks has turned to China for growth, planning to more than triple its over 3,000-store network within a decade.\nBut for the time being, investors want new Chief Executive Kevin Johnson, still overshadowed by his predecessor and current Executive Chairman Howard Schultz, to deliver more robust growth in Starbucks' home market, with roughly 14,000 stores.\nThe stock is up 3.2 percent from a year ago, versus the 44 percent, turnaround-fueled gain at McDonald's Corp.\nChina same-store sales were up 6 percent. Starbucks recently opened a massive, showcase Reserve Roastery in Shanghai.\nNet income was $2.25 billion, or $1.57 per share, up from $751.8 million, or 51 cents per share, a year ago. The large increase was related to the company's acquisition of 1,300 stores in China.
