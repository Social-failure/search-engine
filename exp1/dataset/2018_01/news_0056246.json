Utah handed the defending NBA champions their most lopsided loss of the season.\nKlay Thompson scored 27 points to lead the Warriors. Kevin Durant added 17 points while Stephen Curry and JaVale McGee chipped in 14 apiece.\nGolden State allowed Utah to shoot 14 of 28 from 3-point range.\nThe Jazz got an initial boost from their outside shooting starting in the first quarter. Utah hit six 3-pointers in the quarter and shot 60 percent from the perimeter. Ingles led the way, going 3-of-3 from long distance.\nThe long-distance marksmanship helped the Jazz surge ahead late in the first quarter. Utah used a 10-2 run, culminating in a second-chance dunk from Rudy Gobert, to stake out a 26-16 lead.\nGolden State cut the deficit in half on back-to-back baskets from McGee before quarter’s end. The Warriors closed to within 38-35 on a jumper from David West. Rubio and Favors scored baskets on three consecutive possessions to push Utah’s lead to 44-35.\nIngles came through two more 3-pointers in the second quarter to keep the pressure on Golden State. The baskets helped fuel a 10-0 run that put the Jazz up 64-49.\nUtah kept putting distance between itself and Golden State through the third quarter, thanks in large part to dominant play from Mitchell. The rookie guard scored 12 points in the quarter after foul trouble limited him to just nine minutes before halftime.\nThe Jazz led by as many as 21 points during the third quarter, going up 97-76 when Jonas Jerebko turned a steal into a layup.\n--Field Level Media\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-01-31T12:51:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-31T16:41:14.011+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
