With more projects expected to join the community in the future, the Company believes that NRC will attract huge user traffic for DCON. DCON reports that it has now completed its launch on the NRC community, and that as of December 30, 2017, 100 communities have been established in NRC.\nThe transfer agreement stipulates that the Company will pay $9.6 million for the transfer of 60% DCON digital assets, to be paid through the issuance of 1.2 million Company shares to the seller of the DCON digital assets at $8.00 per share. Both DigiPay and the seller of the DCON digital assets have agreed to establish an operational company in Japan with the tentative name 'DCON DigiPay Corp.' into which they can transfer the DCON digital assets. Future FinTech will hold a 60% equity interest in this entity and seller's designated company, Nature Worldwide Resources Ltd. will hold a 40% equity interest in this entity.\n\"We believe that blockchain technology is a disruptive technology that will change the way that companies and people interact. By developing a blockchain financial center, we hope to create a value chain using blockchain cryptography that will connect currencies, users and projects to form a mutually beneficial ecological model to maximize the business value of blockchain technology,\" concluded Mr. Hongke Xue, Chief Executive Officer of Future FinTech.\nRelated Recent Event\nOn January 4, 2018, the Company previously announced that it received a 5% equity interest in Nova Realm Limited (\"Nova Realm\"), which was gifted to the company by Mr. Yongke Xue, a director of Future FinTech.
