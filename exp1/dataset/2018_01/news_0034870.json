In March another Islamic State-inspired attacker killed five people by driving a car into passers-by on London’s Westminster Bridge and then stabbing to death a police officer in the grounds of parliament.\nRees said Osborne hired a van and drove to London from his home in Cardiff. After a plan to attack an anti-Israel march failed, Osborne drove around seeking alternative targets.\nHe is accused of ramming the crowd at Finsbury Park as worshippers helped Ali who he had earlier become unwell.\nThe court was told Osborne, who had never previously openly expressed racist opinions, had become obsessed with Muslims in the weeks before the attack after watching a BBC television drama “Three Girls”, based on true stories of victims of child sex gangs comprised mainly of British Pakistani men.\nRees said Osborne searched online for material related to the show, some of which was connected to far-right groups and Jayda Fransen, deputy leader of Britain First.\nOne of Fransen’s messages was re-tweeted by U.S. President Donald Trump in November.\nTwo days before the attack, Osborne told a serving soldier in a pub in Cardiff: “I‘m going to kill all the Muslims”, the jurors were told.\nRees said Osborne’s former partner Sarah Andrews described the father of four as a loner and a functioning alcoholic with an unpredictable temperament who took medication for depression.\n“With the benefit of hindsight, she describes him as a ticking time-bomb,” the prosecutor said.\nThe trial, which is expected to last two weeks, continues.
