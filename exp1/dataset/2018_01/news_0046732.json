It expects revenue of about $27 billion versus analysts’ estimate of $26.91 billion.\nHowever, the company said its 2018 segment operating margin would be in the low to mid 11 percent range, slightly below the 11.5 percent reported in the year ended Dec. 31.\n“There is likely some conservatism in the margin guidance, but this may also be driven by new business wins, which typically have lower margins in the early stages,” Jefferies analyst Sheila Kahyaoglu wrote in a note.\nNorthrop is also ramping up production of the U.S. Air Force’s new B-21 long-range bomber, an estimated $80 billion program, expected to produce 100 aircraft.\nSales at Northrop’s aerospace unit, which makes the center fuselage for the F-35 jets and is its biggest, rose 4.6 percent to $3.01 billion, in the fourth quarter, while sales in the mission systems, Northrop’s second biggest, rose 6.3 percent to $3.03 billion.\nTotal sales rose to $6.63 billion in the quarter, from $6.40 billion a year earlier, topping Wall Street expectation of $6.35 billion. ( bit.ly/2DBxzFn )\nHowever, net income for the maker of Global Hawk surveillance planes fell to $178 million, or $1.01 per share, from $525 million, or $2.96 per share, a year earlier.\nNet earnings were hurt by a higher tax expense and $500 million discretionary pre-tax pension contribution.\nOn an adjusted basis, Northrop earned $2.82 per share, beating analysts’ average expectation of $2.74, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.\nReporting by Ankit Ajmera in Bengaluru; Editing by Anil D'Silva and Supriya Kurane\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-25T13:55:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-25T14:13:01.011+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
