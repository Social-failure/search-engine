About a third of those will be in the state of Mato Grosso, where recently grain growers have relied more on the barter system to finance their crop. \nUnder barter, multinational commodities trading firms and agriculture product resellers supply inputs to farmers in exchange for securing future delivery of a portion of their crops. \nFor the first time since the 2008/2009 crop season, barter represented more than half of crop financing for producers in the state, according to Imea, a research agency based in Brazil's largest grain producing state. \n\"Barter is only used in Brazil,\" Aguiar said, adding the bank can offer loan options potentially more competitive to producers. \nState-run Banco do Brasil SA remains Brazil's largest rural credit provider, with about 66 percent of farm loans totaling 188 billion reais as of last October, according a ranking compiled by bank association Febraban.
