The company’s 109 executive jets delivered in 2017 came near the bottom of a target range of 105 to 125 Phenom, Legacy and Lineage aircraft. \nEmbraer shares edged up 0.3 percent in early trading on the Sao Paulo stock exchange. \nThe planemaker’s backlog of firm orders, a gauge of future revenue, slipped 2.7 pct to $18.3 billion in December from $18.8 billion in September.
