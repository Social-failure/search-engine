It has shed 1.6 percent in the past six sessions. \n“Things were a bit slower and the trend is continuing,” said Dimantha Mathew, head of research, First Capital Holdings. \n“Market is coming towards a correction rather than profit-taking as the latter lasted far more than expected. However, foreigners are still on the buying side.” \nForeign investors bought shares worth net 146.2 million rupees ($949,968) on Wednesday, extending the net foreign inflow so far this year to 3 billion rupees. \nThey had net bought 18.5 billion rupees worth equities in 2017 and 633.5 million rupees in 2016. \nTurnover stood at 491.1 million rupees on Wednesday, less than last year’s daily average of 915.3 million rupees. \nShares in Hemas Holdings Plc ended 1.8 percent lower, Sri Lanka Telecom Plc closed 1.4 percent down, and Overseas Realty Plc closed 2.9 percent lower. $1 = 153.9000 Sri Lankan rupees Reporting by Ranga Sirilal and Shihar Aneez; Editing by Sherry Jacob-Phillips", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-17T14:24:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-17T15:09:59.067+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
