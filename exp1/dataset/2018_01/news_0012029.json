They had not known of his stage name or drug-referencing songs prior to the case, said Jim Martin, a spokesman for federal prosecutors in Providence.\nIn a court filing seeking a lenient sentence, Persaud’s lawyers cited his music career as evidence of his work ethic, without referencing “Sell Drugsz” or “Feds Watching.”\n“Persaud has shown an ability and a proclivity to work at legitimate jobs throughout his life and knows the value of hard work and self-sufficiency,” his attorneys wrote.\nReporting by Scott Malone; Editing by Marguerita Choy\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-10T23:01:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-10T23:15:30.004+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
