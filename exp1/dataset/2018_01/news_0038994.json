REUTERS/Edgar Su/File Photo “India is going to be a real nice surprise for AirAsia,” he said.\nThe Indian government this month said it would allow foreign investors to participate in a planned privatization process for rival state-owned carrier Air India, but Fernandes on Tuesday ruled out AirAsia’s involvement.\n“We know what we are good at - low cost,” he said. “Air India is a great airline, but it is really not our business model and not something that we would be involved in.”\nFernandes told Bloomberg on Tuesday in a separate interview that the group will look at ordering more airplanes “eventually but not at present”. AirAsia also has no plans to bring forward deliveries despite strong demand, he said.\nReporting by Jamie Freed in Singapore; Editing by Hugh Lawson\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-01-23T21:09:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-23T20:47:48.062+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
