Roche will report full-year sales of the medicine approved last March 29 in the United States when it delivers 2017 figures on Feb. 1.\nRoche Chief Executive Severin Schwan is counting on Ocrevus revenue to help offset sales declines from his big three cancer drugs Rituxan, Herceptin and Avastin that combine now for about $20 billion annually but are losing patent protection and face intense competition from rivals’ cheaper copies.\n“Until Ocrevus, people with primary progressive MS -- who often have to rely on a cane or wheelchair, give up work or have carers look after them -- have not had an approved treatment to slow the progression of their disease,” Gavin Giovannoni, a neurology professor at Barts and The London School of Medicine and Dentistry who has worked with Roche on studying the drug, said in Roche’s statement.\nOcrevus is administered every six months and costs around $65,000 per year before discounts in the United States, a price below that of Merck’s Rebif. In trials, Ocrevus outperformed Rebif in relapsing MS.\nReporting by John Miller; Editing by Michael Shields\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-12T08:48:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-12T09:54:51.010+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
