The index rose 0.19 percent last week, recording its first weekly gain in three. \nShares in conglomerate John Keells Holdings Plc were down 1.6 percent, while Dialog Axiata Plc lost 0.7 percent, and Sri Lanka Telecom Plc ended 2.5 percent weaker. \nTurnover was 337.1 million rupees ($2.19 million), well below last year’s daily average of 915.3 million rupees. \nForeign investors bought a net 404,053 rupees worth of shares on Monday, extending the year-to-date net foreign inflow to 4.02 billion rupees worth of equities.
