But it is now trading around 1.2330 and verbal signals have so far been more benign.\nDraghi also played down expectations that sharply higher oil prices could offset the negative inflation impact of a strong euro, arguing that projections only see a “very modest” rise in energy inflation.\nHe added that energy inflation will push up overall prices only slightly and the indirect impact of higher energy costs on other goods and services will be limited in the near future.\nReporting by Balazs Koranyi; Editing by Francesco Canepa and Catherine Evans\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-01-24T16:25:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-25T13:03:46.009+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
