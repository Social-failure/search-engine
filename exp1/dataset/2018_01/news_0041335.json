Also found inside the large collapsed cave, once inhabited by humans, were blades and other stone tools that were sophisticated for the time, several hearths and burnt animal bones.\nHomo sapiens first appeared in Africa, with the earliest-known fossils roughly 300,000 years old. A key milestone was when our species first ventured out of Africa en route to populating the far corners of the globe.\nUntil now, the oldest Homo sapiens fossils outside Africa had come from two other cave sites in Israel, including one also on Mount Carmel, about 90,000 to 120,000 years old.\nThe left maxilla of human remains from Misliya Cave in Israel, the oldest remains of our species Homo sapiens found outside Africa, is shown in this handout photo released on January 25, 2018.

They also made extensive use of plant materials, including perhaps for bedding,” Quam added.\nReporting by Will Dunham; Editing by Sandra Maler\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-25T21:04:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-25T21:46:39.006+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
