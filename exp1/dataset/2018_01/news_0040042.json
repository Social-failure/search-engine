China has already leased a strategic port in the southern city of Hambantota and is building a financial city near the main port in Colombo, the capital, with an investment of $1.4 billion. \nGlobal investors have expressed interest in investment in Sri Lanka, which is strategically located on the east-west shipping route of the Indian Ocean. \nThe FTA has potential for diversification of exports through the trade-investment nexus it encourages and new joint venture opportunities for Sri Lankan companies, the trade ministry said. \nThe services sector in the pact is wider than in proposed pacts with China and India, including telecommunications, financial services, e-commerce, and government procurement. \nSri Lanka, with a population of 20 million, is already in discussion with China and India for similar comprehensive pacts to tap more than 2 billion consumers.
