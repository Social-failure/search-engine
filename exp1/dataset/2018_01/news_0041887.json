Now, with the United States in the throes of one of the worst flu seasons in several years, demand for the larger volume bags - used to hydrate flu patients - has increased dramatically.\n“We’ve been producing as much as we can, but we’re not the only one in the market,” said Baxter spokesman William Rader.\nThe market for the larger bags had been constrained even before the hurricane. In August, B. Braun Medical warned customers that production interruptions had caused decreases in supply of the company’s small- and large-volume products.\nIn a statement issued earlier this month, U.S. Food and Drug Administration Commissioner Scott Gottlieb said the agency had given B. Braun and Baxter temporary approval to import products from some of their overseas operations, including allowing Baxter to import product from Brazil. At that time, Gottlieb said he believed the IV fluid shortage would improve shortly.\nThe FDA has also been working with companies to extend expiration dates on products, when it can be done safely. It recently approved two additional companies - Fresenius Kabi, a unit of Germany’s Fresenius, and Spain’s Laboratorios Grifols - to supply saline to the U.S. market.\nIn its letter to customers, Baxter said the FDA has now granted it permanent approval to bring larger IV bags manufactured in Mexico into the U.S. market.\n“The news is very good,” said Christi Guess, senior director of contract services for Vizient, which negotiates with medical companies on behalf of its member hospitals.\nShe said with the addition of the products from the Mexico plant, Baxter is now up to 100 percent allocation for most saline products, which means clients can order 100 percent of what they have historically ordered in the past, but no more.\nErin Fox, who tracks nationwide drug shortages and heads the University of Utah health system’s drug information and support services, said saline supply issues remain.\n“We’re not even close to getting what we used to,” she said.\nHospital pharmacists have turned to a number of workarounds to address the shortages. For example, hospitals have used syringes to deliver some medications but that has resulted in shortages of syringes, Fox said.\n“It’s a house of cards,” Fox said. “Each solution you come up with has resulted in some kind of a roadblock.”\nReporting by Julie Steenhuysen; Editing by Cynthia Osterman, Leslie Adler and Frances Kerry\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-25T00:40:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-25T00:55:19.007+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
