But the inability to store excess electricity remains a major drawback.\nAs a result, its gas-to-power plants need to be ramped up and down to accommodate the fickle supply from renewables, which enjoy priority access to the power grid over other sources.\nHouseholds and companies are paying more than 20 billion euros a year in surcharges on their utility bills to keep the system going, which sees some wind parks taken off-grid during storms but operators still getting guaranteed pay.\nThe pilot plant for the new initiative is scheduled to go on stream at an Evonik site in Marl, Germany by 2021.\nIf successful, the two companies’ Rheticus alliance could follow up with a site producing 20,000 tonnes of basic chemicals a year, about one fifth of the average capacity of a petrochemical plant serving world markets.\nRheticus will for now receive 2.8 million euros ($3.4 million) in government funding over two years, with the companies contributing roughly the same amount.
