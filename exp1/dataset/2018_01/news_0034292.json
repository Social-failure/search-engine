Its board proposed a second-half dividend of 0.50 riyal, down from 1.0 riyal in the first half, but also approved the start of two projects to produce equipment for solar and wind energy generation. Investment in the projects is to total 260 million riyals ($69 million). \nQatar’s index closed 0.7 percent higher after a surge in late trade. Qatar First Bank, the most heavily traded stock, gained 2.2 percent. \nIn Egypt, the blue-chip index fell 0.6 percent. Nozha International Hospital, which had soared in the last three days after Cleopatra Hospital sought regulatory approval to make a mandatory tender offer for all Nozha shares at 90 Egyptian pounds each, lost steam and last traded only 0.4 percent higher at 83.50 pounds. \nCleopatra rose 5.2 percent in its heaviest trade since last April.
