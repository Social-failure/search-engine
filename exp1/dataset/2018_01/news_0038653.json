He has denied assaulting anyone, saying any encounters with his accusers were consensual. \nOnline video footage showed Cosby wearing a sweatshirt and seated on a stool in the club. Describing people’s reactions when he walks into things he cannot see, Cosby said: “There’s a perfectly good word called ‘stop,’ not ‘oh-oh-oh-oh-oh’,” drawing laughs from the crowd. \nCosby’s show was widely criticized on Twitter, with novelist Terry McMillan saying: “If you gave me front row seats to see Bill Cosby I’d burn them.” \nJeff Romaine tweeted: “NO ONE should ever go see him publicly without bringing a sack full of rotten fruit to throw. I would just feel bad for the fruit.” \nCosby is scheduled go to trial on April 2 on charges that he drugged and assaulted Andrea Constand at his home in the Philadelphia suburb of Cheltenham. His first trial ended in a mistrial in June. \nPennsylvania prosecutors asked the judge in the case last week to allow the testimony of 19 other accusers, including 12 women who were not allowed to testify in the entertainer’s first trial.
