The agreement runs until the end of 2018.\nReporting by Ahmed Hagagy; Writing by Rania El Gamal; Editing by Dale Hudson\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-01-17T18:37:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-18T16:05:57.018+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
