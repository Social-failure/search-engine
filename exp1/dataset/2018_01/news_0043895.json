REUTERS/Toru Hanai THIRD TIME LUCKY \nBut they will both privately burn for a breakthrough as two players who have come close but never quite been able to seal the deal. \nEach have failed twice in grand slam finals and long played with queries about whether they have the mental fortitude to clinch one of the major trophies. \nWozniacki, who lost the 2009 U.S. Open final to Belgian Kim Clijsters and again in 2014 to Williams, labored under the tag of “world number one without a grand slam” for the 67 weeks she was at the top in 2010-12. \nSince October, 26-year-old Halep is now the holder of that dubious honor, having missed out in last year’s French Open final to Latvian teen Jelena Ostapenko and also to Maria Sharapova at Roland Garros in 2014. \nIn a tournament that has shaken out a raft of baseline bashers, it is two scrambling counter-punchers that have survived and now have their chance. \nWhen they last met, eventual champion Wozniacki thrashed Halep in straight sets in the round-robin phase of the WTA Finals in Singapore in October and holds a 4-2 career record over the Romanian.

Emotions are there,” Halep said. \n“Pressures are there for both of us. We’ll see what is going to happen.” \nFactbox on the finalists.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-26T14:28:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-26T14:40:47.004+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
