The amounts offered were the same as in previous operations.\nIn all three categories, the quantum of sales by traders was the smallest so far this month, suggesting few investors are eager to sell JGBs at current levels.\nWith the 10-year JGB yield not far from 0.11 percent, the BOJ’s defence line since it started the yield curve control policy, few market players are eager to sell JGBs at current levels.\nThe five-year yield dipped 1.0 basis point to minus 0.135 percent while the 20-year yield also dropped 1.0 basis point to minus 0.590 percent.\n$1 = 110.87 yen Reporting by Tokyo Markets Team; Editing by Sunil Nair\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-01-19T15:36:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-20T17:48:00.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
