REUTERS/Satish Kumar Clark told Reuters on Oct. 11 that Emirates was open to working with Etihad, including on procurement.\n“I think there is value to be had working more closely with them,” Clark said in October.\nEmirates and Etihad face common challenges; a lobbying campaign in the United States to investigate accusations that they are unfairly state subsidized, which they both deny, as well as overcapacity, security concerns, and a drop in regional business travel.\nUnder Monday’s agreement, Emirates Group Security will provide security and training programs to Etihad, and help develop their security escort capability.\nEmirates is the largest Middle East airline, and the younger Etihad had unsuccessfully spent billions trying to catch up by buying stakes in more than half a dozen operators around the world. Its most high-profile investments, Air Berlin and Italy’s Alitalia, filed for administration last year and contributed to Etihad falling into the red in 2016 for the first time since 2010.\nEmirates started developing closer ties with fellow Dubai state-owned carrier flydubai last year.\nReporting by Alexander Cornwell; Editing by Sherry Jacob-Phillips and Louise Heavens\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-08T09:15:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-08T09:43:54.004+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
