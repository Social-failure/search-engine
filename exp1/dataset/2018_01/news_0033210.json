If it is on camera then I try really, really hard. Doing competitions it is good to show off.” NO PRESSURE \nAnother Briton who made the men’s slopestyle final in Sochi is Billy Morgan. The 28-year-old stressed the importance of the British team being friends and not having the pressure associated with competing for some of the bigger winter Olympics nations. \n“I think some people will be holding stuff back (for the Olympics). I think the Canadians especially,” he said in October. \n“They will be holding some tricks back because, mainly, they have to compete between the others in their nation because they are all going for the podium. They don’t want the other guys knowing what they have been up to.” \n“Luckily for us we are all ‘shred-homies’ and we just ride together all the time and we don’t have to hide things from each other.” \nMorgan and his fellow ‘shred-homies’ will have two cracks at Olympic glory this time around, as Big Air snowboarding has been introduced to the program for the first time. \nFor many of the athletes who have been competing in Big Air for a long time, this is a very welcome addition to the Olympics and gives them a second crack at a medal. \nIt also represents another chance for Great Britain to punch above their weight and bring more medals home from Pyeongchang.
