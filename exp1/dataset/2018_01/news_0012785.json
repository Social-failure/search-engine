Social Democratic Party (SPD) leader Martin Schulz delivers a speech before exploratory talks about forming a new coalition government at the SPD headquarters in Berlin, Germany, January 7, 2018. REUTERS/Hannibal Hanschke \nThe measure, an election promise by the conservatives, is designed to provide tax relief for high earners.
