Traders cited continued talk the carmaker could look at strategic deals such as spin-offs and disposals in the last year with CEO Sergio Marchionne at the helm at the company. \nCommodities also continued their climb, with stronger metals prices helping the STOXX 600 materials index rise 1.2 percent to hit its highest since March 2012. \nFinancials provided the biggest boost to the STOXX as optimism over Europe’s economic growth prevailed. \n“In an environment of solid growth and rising long-term yields in Europe, financials and value stocks in general are likely to outperform, as well as energy,” said Mirabaud’s Bissat, who is overweight on financials stocks. \nElsewhere among cyclicals, Germany’s Siemens rose 0.5 percent after its industrial production and exports rose more than expected in November. \nGermany-listed shares in South African retailer Steinhoff fell 5.4 percent after the ECB sold its Steinhoff bond at a loss as the company grapples with an accounting scandal. \nMorrisons, up 2.4 percent, was among top gainers after the UK retailer reported a stronger than anticipated Christmas trading season. Marks & Spencer also gained.
