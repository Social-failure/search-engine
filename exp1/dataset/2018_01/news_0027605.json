REUTERS/Juan Medina \nThe Catalan parliament’s committee, which overseas how the administration runs, was set up on Wednesday with a majority of separatist members. \nWhile the question of voting and ruling from abroad has received lots of attention recently, the Spanish government has also warned that it would appeal to the Constitutional Court if the committee allowed Puigdemont to vote by proxy.

Some members of the previous committee are the target of a judicial probe over the illegal independence referendum organised in October. \nRajoy’s deputy Soraya Saenz de Santamaria on Thursday urged parliament to respect the law, telling Cadena Cope radio: “He (Puigdemont) knows it, he can’t rule from the Bahamas.” \nThe previous Puigdemont-led administration made a unilateral declaration of independence in October after the referendum, triggering one of Spain’s biggest political crises since its return to democracy four decades ago. The government in Madrid imposed direct rule on the region. \nRajoy called regional elections on Dec. 21 in a bid to weaken the independence movement, but the vote returned an assembly with a separatist majority.
