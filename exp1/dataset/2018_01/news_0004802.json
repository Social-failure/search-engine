The benchmark S&P index closed above 2,700 for the first time on Wednesday and the Nasdaq settled above 7,000 a day earlier. Both indexes also registered closing record highs on Thursday. \nStrong manufacturing and services sector data from the world’s largest economies provided a bullish tone on Thursday, while other data showed U.S. private employers stepped up hiring in December. Friday will bring the key U.S. non-farm payrolls report. \n“There are expectations we will see volatility creep back into the market and pull this market down,” at some point this year, said Quincy Krosby, chief market strategist at Prudential Financial in Newark, New Jersey. \n“But as long as you have economic growth and earnings moving higher... there’s still a solid underpinning,” she said. The rally shows “investors are expecting conditions to remain solid at least in the initial couple of months.” \nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJI rose 152.45 points, or 0.61 percent, to 25,075.13, the S&P 500 .SPX gained 10.93 points, or 0.40 percent, to 2,723.99 and the Nasdaq Composite .IXIC added 12.38 points, or 0.18 percent, to 7,077.92. \nThe Cboe Volatility Index .VIX, better known as the VIX and a popular options-based gauge of expected near-term price volatility, closed at 9.22. The index has been flirting with record lows in recent months.

Grant, head of trading at Keefe, Bruyette & Woods in New York. \n“As we head into earnings, a lot of people will take a break. The banks are well owned. People are positive, but the banks are due for a little pause.” \nS&P 500 companies are expected to soon begin reporting quarterly earnings, with JPMorgan results due next week. \nOn the downside, Victoria’s Secret owner L Brands ( LB.N ) slid 12.3 percent on a disappointing quarterly earnings forecast. \nMacy’s ( M.N ) shares fell 3.3 percent after reporting only modest growth in holiday sales and saying it would close stores and slash thousands of jobs this year. \nOther department store operators including J.C. Penney Co Inc ( JCP.N ) also tumbled. \nAdvancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 1.46-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.50-to-1 ratio favored advancers. \nVolume held up despite a powerful blizzard that caused power outages and travel problems in the U.S. Northeast, and walloped New York City with snow. \nAbout 7.0 billion shares changed hands on U.S. exchanges, above the 6.3 billion daily average for the past 20 trading days, according to Thomson Reuters data.
