Prosecutors have called for a life sentence in a trial due to begin next month. \nAkilov had asked in online conversations for practical advice on building a bomb and for spiritual guidance ahead of a “martyr operation”, the charges filed with a Stockholm court alleged. Johan Olsson, head of the security police operations, Christer Nilsson, head of the police investigation unit, and Prosecutor Hans Ihrman comment on the prosecution for the April 7 attack, in Stockholm, Sweden January 30, 2018. TT News Agency/Henrik Montgomery/via REUTERS \nIn his online correspondence, Akilov discussed Swedish support for NATO and said the country had sent bomb technicians to Iraq to train Kurdish forces fighting Islamic State, the militant group that has been routed from territory it held. \nAkilov has admitted killing five people in the attack. His defence lawyer was due to comment on the charges at a news conference at 1200 GMT. \nOn April 7 last year, Akilov hijacked a beer truck outside a restaurant in central Stockholm and sped some 500 meters (yards) down a pedestrian street, ploughing into shoppers before crashing the truck into a department store. \nThree people - including an 11 year old girl - were killed immediately and two of the dozen injured died later in hospital. \nIn Sweden, charges are brought after the preliminary investigation is completed and suspects can be held in custody until that time.
