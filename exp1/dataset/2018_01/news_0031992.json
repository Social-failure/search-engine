The synagogue, which had stood on the site for 1,900 years, was largely destroyed.\nGanczarski’s sentence is due to end in February, and U.S. authorities have previously indicated that they want him extradited.\nFrench officials said that Ganczarski attacked prison guards last week, after being recorded on a telephone call saying he would do something in order to remain in France.\nFrench prosecutors opened a counter-terrorism investigation into the attack on the guards, which could delay any extradition.\nReporting By Brendan Pierson, Editing by Rosalba O'Brien\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-01-18T08:12:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-18T02:24:53.008+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
