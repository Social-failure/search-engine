The next trip that remains on his agenda is the World Economic Forum in Switzerland towards the end of the month.\nReporting by Ueslei Marcelino and Lisandra Paraguassu; Writing by Gram Slattery; Editing by Bernadette Baum\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-04T14:57:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-04T15:07:29.014+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
