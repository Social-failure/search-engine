Last year Canada tapped Google parent Alphabet Inc to help plan a mixed-use development in Toronto using advanced digital technologies and urban design.\nTrudeau’s office did not respond to requests for comment.\nReporting by David Ljunggren; Editing by Phil Berlowitz\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-19T19:51:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-19T20:09:35.021+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
