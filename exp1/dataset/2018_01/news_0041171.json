Full year net income for 2017 was $46.6 million, or $1.19 per fully diluted share, compared to $47.6 million, or $1.28 per fully diluted share, for full year 2016. Net income for the fourth quarter of 2017 was $5.4 million, compared to $14.4 million in the third quarter of 2017 and $10.3 million in the fourth quarter of 2016. Fully diluted earnings per share were $.14 in the fourth quarter of 2017, compared to $.37 in the third quarter of 2017 and $.28 in the fourth quarter of 2016. Net income for the fourth quarter and full year ended December 31, 2017 includes the impact of a $10.7 million non-cash tax expense on tax reform and merger election related revaluation of our net deferred tax assets and $911,000 in after tax securities losses related to an investment portfolio restructure. Additionally, after tax merger expenses of $1.6 million and $3.3 million were included in our results for the quarter and year ended December 31, 2017, respectively.\nIncome before income taxes for 2017 was $87.6 million compared to $73.8 million for full year 2016. Income before income taxes for the fourth quarter of 2017 was $24.6 million, compared to $22.0 million in the third quarter of 2017 and $15.9 million in the fourth quarter of 2016. The annual and linked-quarter increases were primarily attributable to an increase in net interest income, partially offset by an increase in noninterest expenses, both of which related to the AloStar Bank of Commerce acquisition.\nJoe Evans, Chairman of State Bank Financial, commented, “2017 was a great year for State Bank by any measure. With the completion of a significant, immediately accretive acquisition and our continued focus on expense control and margin management, we grew pretax income 18.8% over the prior year. Further, we believe our strong finish in 2017 has set the stage for another solid year in 2018.”\nOperating Highlights\nInterest income on loans improved to $46.9 million in the fourth quarter of 2017, an $11.5 million increase from the third quarter of 2017 and a $20.2 million increase from the fourth quarter of 2016. Net interest income of $58.0 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 increased from $44.3 million in the third quarter of 2017 and $39.1 million in the fourth quarter of 2016. Accretion income on loans was $10.7 million in the fourth quarter of 2017, up from $6.5 million in the third quarter of 2017 and $10.3 million in the fourth quarter of 2016. The $4.2 million linked-quarter increase was primarily due to unexpected acceleration of certain purchased credit impaired loan payoffs. As of December 31, 2017, approximately $58 million of accretable discount remains to be recognized as loan accretion income.\nNoninterest income was $10.1 million in the fourth quarter of 2017, compared to $9.7 million in the third quarter of 2017 and $9.9 million in the fourth quarter of 2016. Revenues in SBA and payroll and insurance increased $402,000 and $211,000, respectively, in the fourth quarter of 2017, compared to the third quarter of 2017, while mortgage banking income decreased $235,000. Loss on sale of securities was $1.5 million in the fourth quarter of 2017, as we opportunistically restructured our portfolio and sold certain lower yielding securities in a loss position and reinvested into higher yielding securities.\nTotal noninterest expense for the fourth quarter of 2017 was $40.7 million, compared to $31.6 million in the third quarter of 2017 and $32.9 million in the fourth quarter of 2016. The $9.1 million linked-quarter increase was primarily due to $7.8 million of noninterest expense related to the AloStar Bank of Commerce acquisition.\nFinancial Condition\nTotal assets at December 31, 2017, were $5.0 billion, down from $5.1 billion at September 30, 2017. Total loans were $3.5 billion at December 31, 2017, down $40.6 million from the third quarter of 2017. Period-end organic loans increased to $2.4 billion at December 31, 2017, an increase of $61.2 million from the third quarter of 2017. Purchased non-credit impaired loans decreased to $990.7 million at December 31, 2017, a $73.7 million linked-quarter decline. Purchased credit impaired loans decreased to $175.6 million at December 31, 2017, a $28.0 million linked-quarter decline.\nPast due organic and purchased non-credit impaired loans were .20% and .40% of their respective portfolios at December 31, 2017. The provision for loan losses on organic and purchased non-credit impaired loans was $2.1 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 and was primarily attributable to net charge-offs, organic loan growth, and continued seasoning of the purchased non-credit impaired portfolio. The organic allowance as a percent of organic loans was 1.02% at the end of the fourth quarter of 2017.\nTotal deposits at December 31, 2017, were $4.2 billion, up $2.1 million from September 30, 2017. Period-end transaction accounts, comprised of noninterest-bearing demand deposits and interest-bearing transaction accounts, increased $80.4 million from the third quarter of 2017. Noninterest-bearing demand deposits represented 28.1% of total deposits as of December 31, 2017. Average noninterest-bearing demand deposits were $1.1 billion, a $143.8 million increase from the third quarter of 2017 and a $274.9 million increase from the fourth quarter of 2016.\nTom Wiley, Vice Chairman and CEO, commented “After a record setting year in 2017, I’m even more optimistic about our prospects for 2018. Benefits from the full integration of the AloStar acquisition, tax reform and economic trends in our core markets should all be positive catalysts for State Bank. Our strategic priorities remain intently focused on taking extraordinary care of our clients, continuing to build our core deposit base, being disciplined risk managers and growing earnings per share.”\nTangible book value per share was $14.00 at the end of the fourth quarter of 2017. State Bank Financial Corporation continues to be well capitalized, ending the quarter with a leverage ratio of 11.24% and a Tier I risk-based capital ratio of 12.61%.\nDetailed Results\nSupplemental tables displaying financial results for the fourth quarter of 2017, the previous four quarters, and full year 2017 are included with this press release.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nThis press release contains financial measures determined by methods other than in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”).

As such, we do not consider purchased credit impaired loans to be nonperforming assets.\nState Bank Financial Corporation 4Q17 Financial Supplement: Table 7 Condensed Consolidated Average Balances and Yield Analysis Quarterly (Unaudited) 4Q17 change vs (Dollars in thousands) 4Q17 3Q17 2Q17 1Q17 4Q16 3Q17 4Q16 Average Balances Interest-bearing deposits in other financial institutions and federal funds sold $ 168,223 $ 108,546 $ 73,862 $ 85,720 $ 82,797 $ 59,677 $ 85,426 Investment securities 924,933 913,898 947,300 961,913 911,025 11,035 13,908 Loans, excluding purchased credit impaired (1) 3,413,159 2,762,479 2,762,996 2,692,517 2,307,794 650,680 1,105,365 Purchased credit impaired loans 190,323 130,708 142,419 154,054 123,718 59,615 66,605 Total earning assets 4,696,638 3,915,631 3,926,577 3,894,204 3,425,334 781,007 1,271,304 Total nonearning assets 285,813 263,100 274,266 287,757 211,210 22,713 74,603 Total assets 4,982,451 4,178,731 4,200,843 4,181,961 3,636,544 803,720 1,345,907 Interest-bearing transaction accounts 664,938 580,090 585,343 602,378 575,977 84,848 88,961 Savings & money market deposits 1,685,292 1,383,326 1,380,586 1,388,876 1,118,548 301,966 566,744 Time deposits 724,578 420,192 437,475 456,811 385,146 304,386 339,432 Brokered and wholesale time deposits 25,911 49,675 38,353 19,926 22,885 (23,764 ) 3,026 Other borrowings 35,353 57,988 119,652 81,344 52,555 (22,635 ) (17,202 ) Total interest-bearing liabilities 3,136,072 2,491,271 2,561,409 2,549,335 2,155,111 644,801 980,961 Noninterest-bearing deposits 1,147,834 1,004,046 972,074 955,515 872,954 143,788 274,880 Other liabilities 53,136 44,794 40,066 60,102 48,918 8,342 4,218 Shareholders’ equity 645,409 638,620 627,294 617,009 559,561 6,789 85,848 Total liabilities and shareholders' equity 4,982,451 4,178,731 4,200,843 4,181,961 3,636,544 803,720 1,345,907 Interest Margins (2) Interest-bearing deposits in other financial institutions and federal funds sold .86 % .80 % .50 % .44 % .31 % .06 % .55 % Investment securities, tax-equivalent basis 2.43 2.42 2.39 2.26 2.07 .01 .36 Loans, excluding purchased credit impaired, tax-equivalent basis (3) 5.47 5.11 5.08 5.15 4.63 .36 .84 Purchased credit impaired loans 22.24 19.79 25.99 20.21 33.03 2.45 (10.79 ) Total earning assets 5.39 % 4.85 % 5.11 % 4.93 % 4.87 % .54 % .52 % Interest-bearing transaction accounts .13 .13 .12 .12 .12 — .01 Savings & money market deposits .80 .63 .61 .60 .59 .17 .21 Time deposits 1.04 .72 .69 .72 .72 .32 .32 Brokered and wholesale time deposits 1.15 1.05 1.05 1.06 .85 .10 .30 Other borrowings .52 .76 .82 .65 .45 (.24 ) .07 Total interest-bearing liabilities .71 % .54 % .53 % .52 % .49 % .17 % .22 % Net interest spread 4.68 % 4.31 % 4.58 % 4.41 % 4.38 % .37 % .30 % Net interest margin 4.91 % 4.51 % 4.76 % 4.59 % 4.56 % .40 % .35 % Net interest margin contribution from accretion income on loans .90 % .66 % .94 % .80 % 1.19 % .24 % (.29 )%\n(1) Includes average nonaccrual loans of $11.4 million for 4Q17, $8.0 million for 3Q17, $9.3 million for 2Q17, $9.9 million for 1Q17, and $8.4 million for 4Q16.\n(2) Interest income or expense annualized for the applicable period.\n(3) Reflects taxable equivalent adjustments using the federal statutory tax rate of 35% in adjusting tax-exempt loan interest income to a fully taxable basis.

These non-GAAP financial measures exclude the effect of the period end or average balance of intangible assets. Management believes that these non-GAAP financial measures provides additional useful information to investors, particularly since these measure are widely used by industry analysts for companies with prior merger and acquisition activities, such as us.\nA reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure is presented in the table above. Non-GAAP financial measures have inherent limitations, are not required to be uniformly applied, and are not audited. These non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered as a substitute for GAAP financial measures, and we strongly encourage investors to review the GAAP financial measures included in this press release and not to place undue reliance upon any single financial measure. In addition, because non-GAAP financial measures are not standardized, it may not be possible to compare the non-GAAP financial measures presented in this press release with other companies’ non-GAAP financial measures having the same or similar names.\nInvestor Relations: Sheila Ray 404.239.8684 / sheila.ray@statebt.com\nSource:State Bank Financial Corporation.", "external_links": ["https://www.globenewswire.com/NewsRoom/AttachmentNg/623bb5ae-8427-45c0-b47e-08525c118ea0"], "published": "2018-01-25T15:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-25T17:33:24.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
