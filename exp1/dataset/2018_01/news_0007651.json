However, the divergence between growth in sales of food and non-food has never been so stark,” BRC chief executive Helen Dickinson said.\nNon-food sales fell by 1.4 percent year-on-year in the fourth quarter, the biggest drop since March 2009, while food sales grew by 4.2 percent, the biggest jump since June.\nVisa said on Monday that a broader measure of consumer spending fell in December for the first time since 2012.\nThe BRC said clothing sales did better last month than a year earlier, helped by colder-than-normal weather, while jewelry and toys underperformed compared with the year before.\nThis partly mirrors trading statements from major retailers. Next ( NXT.L ), the country’s biggest clothing store, and discount food retailer Aldi UK reported strong sales, but department store Debenhams ( DEB.L ) cut profit forecasts.\nBritish retail sales data has become harder to interpret in the past couple of years due to signs that some spending may be shifting earlier in the festive period to take advantage of Black Friday discounts in late November.\nBritain’s biggest credit card provider, Barclaycard ( BARC.L ), said consumer spending between Nov. 19 and Dec. 23 was 4.0 percent higher than a year earlier, the sharpest rise in eight months. This period covered Black Friday, and Barclaycard also includes spending at places like hotels, pubs and restaurants, which is growing much faster than retail spending.\nBy contrast, the BRC said retail spending in the Nov. 26-Dec. 30 period was up just 1.4 percent on a year earlier, and only rose by 0.6 percent when changes in shop floor space are adjusted for.\nReporting by David Milliken, editing by Andy Bruce\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-01-09T08:13:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-09T17:12:15.006+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
