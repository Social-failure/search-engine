Since apologizing for the video, Paul has not uploaded anymore clips to his YouTube channel, which has over 15 million subscribers. \nGet Data Sheet , Fortune’s technology newsletter. \nYouTube said Tuesday via Twitter that it was “looking at further consequences” against Paul and stated that “suicide is not a joke, nor should it ever be a driving force for views.” \nThe streaming video service elaborated further on Wednesday and said that Paul’s YouTube channel will not be part of the Google Preferred program, in which advertisers can pay to have their ads shown during videos of a select group of YouTube’s top video creators. \nPaul will also no longer be involved in the upcoming season of Foursome , a comedy web series that’s available on the YouTube Red subscription service. The company also said that Paul’s “new Originals are on hold,” which means that the video blogger’s upcoming YouTube web film The Thinning: New World Order may be in jeopardy. \nFortune contacted YouTube for more information and will update this story if it responds.
