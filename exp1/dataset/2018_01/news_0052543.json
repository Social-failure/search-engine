It says it has left its Nazi past behind. \nThe FPO’s top candidate for elections in the province of Lower Austria, Udo Landbauer, was deputy leader of a fraternity that produced a songbook in 1997 that included references to killing Jews. \nAuthorities are investigating the issue. \nPresident Alexander Van der Bellen eventually called for Landbauer to resign. \nAsked by ORF radio whether he can rule out stepping down, Landbauer, 31, said, “Decidedly.” \nAustria’s main Jewish body, the IKG, and Israel have upheld their boycott of FPO officials even after they joined government last month upon gaining third place, with 26 percent of votes, in parliamentary elections in October. \nThe chief of Lower Austria’s conservatives, which got around half of the votes in Sunday’s elections, said she was ready to work with the Freedom Party, which gained 15 percent, but ruled out bringing Landbauer into the province’s cabinet.
