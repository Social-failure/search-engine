It already sells bags and other accessories with its swirling red, black and blue seat pattern.\n“I already have a buyer who will pay 850 euros,” said Nikita Dutschenko, a young man who said he was missing school to wait in line with dozens of others who camped out overnight in sub-zero temperatures. “You can make good money out of it.”\nRival Nike has previously collaborated with the London underground on several sneaker lines using its patterns and fonts, including to mark its 150th anniversary in 2013.\n($1 = 0.8181 euros)\nReporting by Emma Thomasson; Editing by Adrian Croft\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-16T15:24:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-16T16:23:37.057+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
