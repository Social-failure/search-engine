(NASDAQ:JJSF) today announced sales and earnings for the first quarter ended December 30, 2017.\nSales increased 18% to $265.2 million from $225.6 million in last year’s first quarter. Net earnings increased to $36.2 million in the current quarter from $13.6 million last year. Earnings per diluted share increased to $1.93 for the first quarter from $.72 last year. Operating income increased 10% to $21.2 million in the current quarter from $19.3 million in the year ago quarter.\nNet earnings for the current year quarter benefited from a $20.9 million, or $1.11 per diluted share, gain on the re-measurement of deferred tax liabilities and a $2.0 million, or $0.11 per diluted share, reduction in income taxes related primarily to the lower corporate tax rate enacted under the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act in December 2017. Net earnings were impacted by a $1.2 million, or $.06 per diluted share, provision for the one-time repatriation tax required under the new tax law. Excluding the deferred tax gain and the one-time repatriation tax, our effective tax rate decreased to 28.6% from 34.0% in the prior year quarter reflecting the reduction in the federal statutory rate to 21% from 35% for the remaining three quarters of fiscal 2018. The gain on the re-measurement of deferred tax liabilities and the one-time repatriation tax are preliminary estimates.\nGerald B. Shreiber, J & J’s President and Chief Executive Officer, commented, \"Our retail supermarket and frozen beverages segments had strong quarters; however, our food service segment was impacted for various reasons, some of which have passed or been corrected.

Excluding sales from Hill & Valley, Inc., acquired in January 2017, an ICEE distributor located in the Southeast acquired in June 2017 and Labriola Bakery which was acquired in August 2017, sales increased approximately 7% for the quarter.\nFOOD SERVICE\nSales to food service customers increased $ 31,967,000 or 21% in the first quarter to $182,264,000. Excluding sales of Hill & Valley and Labriola, sales increased $9,569,000 or 6% for the first quarter. Soft pretzel sales to the food service market increased 21% to $50,131,000 in the quarter and about 14% without Labriola sales. In addition to Labriola sales, soft pretzel sales increased significantly to restaurant chains and movie theatres and we had strong sales of our recently introduced BRAUHAUS pretzels.\nFrozen juices and ices sales decreased 4% to $7,184,000 in the three months with sales increases and decreases across our customer base.\nChurro sales to food service customers were up 1% in the quarter to $14,592,000.\nSales of bakery products increased $19,654,000 or 26% in the first quarter to $94,933,000. Excluding sales of Hill & Valley, bakery sales were essentially flat for the quarter.\nSales of handhelds increased $2,773,000 or 37% in the quarter with all of the increase coming from sales to three customers. Sales of funnel cake increased $911,000 or 23% in the quarter to $4,794,000 as we continue to increase sales to school food service.\nSales of new products in the first twelve months since their introduction were approximately $8 million in this quarter. Price increases had no impact on sales in the quarter and net volume increases, including new product sales as defined above and Hill & Valley and Labriola sales, accounted for approximately $32 million of sales in the quarter.\nOperating income in our Food Service segment decreased from $17,054,000 to $15,900,000 in the quarter. Hill & Valley contributed $1,384,000 to operating income in the quarter; however, operating income in the balance of our food service business was impacted by generally higher costs for payroll and insurance, added personnel in the selling function, inefficiencies in our recently acquired Labriola production facility (compounded by the integration of products previously manufactured at other facilities), product mix changes and significantly lower volume concentrated in specific facilities, shutdown costs of our Chambersburg, PA production facility and higher ingredients costs. There was no benefit of pricing to offset these higher costs.\nRETAIL SUPERMARKETS\nSales of products to retail supermarkets increased $1,457,000 or 7% to $23,076,000 in the first quarter. Soft pretzel sales for the first quarter were up 18% to $10,512,000 primarily due to sales of AUNTIE ANNE’S Soft Pretzels*** under a license agreement entered into in 2017. Sales of frozen juices and ices decreased $124,000 or 1% to $9,727,000 in the first quarter. Handheld sales to retail supermarket customers decreased 12% to $3,026,000 in the quarter as the sales of this product line continues their long term decline.\nSales of new products in the first quarter were approximately $1.9 million. Price increases had no impact on sales in the quarter and net volume increases, including new product sales as defined above accounted for $1.5 million of sales in the quarter.\nOperating income in our Retail Supermarkets segment was $2,558,000 in this year’s first quarter compared to $1,046,000 in last year’s quarter, a 145% increase. Lower coupon expense of $508,000 and lower media spending of $543,000 along with the 18% increase in soft pretzel sales were the major reasons for the increase in operating income.\nFROZEN BEVERAGES\nFrozen beverage and related product sales increased 12% to $59,870,000 in the first quarter and excluding sales of the acquired ICEE distributor were up about 10%. Beverage related sales alone were up 21% to $34,303,000 in the quarter and were up about 19% without the sales of the acquired ICEE distributor. Gallon sales were up 15% for the three months with higher sales to movie theatres and across our customer base. Service revenue increased 5% to $19,004,000 in the first quarter with sales increases and decreases spread throughout our customer base.\nSales of beverage machines, which tend to fluctuate from year to year while following no specific trend, were $6,313,000, a decrease of 10%. Operating income in our Frozen Beverage segment increased to $2,770,000 in this quarter compared to $1,227,000 last year as a result of significantly higher beverage sales.\nCONSOLIDATED\nGross profit as a percentage of sales was 27.63% in the three month period this year and 29.21% last year. About 20% of the gross profit percentage decrease in the quarter resulted from the lower gross profit percentage of the Hill & Valley business. The balance of the decrease was caused by higher costs for payroll and insurance, inefficiencies in our recently acquired Labriola production facility (compounded by the integration of products previously manufactured at other facilities), product mix changes, significantly lower volume concentrated in specific facilities, shutdown costs of our Chambersburg, PA production facility and higher ingredients costs. There was no benefit of pricing to offset these higher costs.\nTotal operating expenses increased $5,483,000 in the first quarter but as a percentage of sales decreased to 19.6% from 20.6% last year. Marketing expenses decreased to 8.14% of sales in this year’s quarter from 9.01% last year primarily because of lower media spending in our retail supermarket business and lower marketing expenses of the acquired Hill & Valley and Labriola businesses. Distribution expenses were 7.98% of sales in this year’s quarter and 8.05% of sales in last year’s quarter. Administrative expenses were 3.53% of sales this quarter compared to 3.59% of sales last year in the first quarter\nOperating income increased $1,901,000 or 10% to $21,228,000 in the first quarter as a result of the aforementioned items.\nInvestment income increased by $262,000 in the first quarter resulting from higher amounts invested and slightly higher interest rates.\nOther income this quarter includes a $520,000 gain on a sale of property.\nNet earnings increased $22,709,000, or 168%, in the current three month period to $36,249,000. Net earnings for the current year quarter benefited from a $20.9 million, or $1.11 per diluted share, gain on the remeasurement of deferred tax liabilities and a $2.0 million, or $0.11 per diluted share, reduction in income taxes related primarily to the lower corporate tax rate enacted under the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act in December 2017. Net earnings were impacted by a $1.2 million, or $.06 per diluted share, provision for the one time repatriation tax required under the new tax law. Excluding the deferred tax gain and the one time repatriation tax, our effective tax rate decreased to 28.6% from 34.0% in the prior year quarter reflecting the reduction in the federal statutory rate to 21% from 35% for the remaining three quarters of fiscal 2018. Last year’s quarter’s effective tax rate benefitted from an unusually high tax benefit on shared based compensation of $783,000 which compares to this year’s quarter’s tax benefit of $137,000. We are presently estimating an effective tax rate of 28-29% for the last three quarters of our fiscal year 2018 and 26-27% for our fiscal year 2019.\nThere are many factors which can impact our net earnings from year to year and in the long run, among which are the supply and cost of raw materials and labor, insurance costs, factors impacting sales as noted above, the continuing consolidation of our customers, our ability to manage our manufacturing, marketing and distribution activities, our ability to make and integrate acquisitions and changes in tax laws and interest rates.\nThe forward-looking statements contained herein are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements. Readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, which reflect management’s analysis only as of the date hereof.
