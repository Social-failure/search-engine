REUTERS/Hannibal Hanschke \nShe said networks such as Twitter need to take some responsibility for posts on their platforms but “without being given the role of judge”. \nAfter the Titanic account was blocked a Twitter spokesman said the company did not comment on individual accounts for reasons of privacy and security. \nSahra Wagenknecht, parliamentary leader of the radical Left, told the Funke group of newspapers that her party supported initiatives to abandon the law. \n“The law is a slap in the face for all democratic principles because, in a constitutional state, courts rather than companies make decisions about what is unlawful and what is not,” she said. \nThe AfD has already announced that it will consider filing a complaint against the law. \nOn Thursday Germany’s top-selling Bild newspaper also called for the law to be scrapped, saying it was stifling free speech and making martyrs out of anti-immigrant politicians whose posts are deleted. \n($1 = 0.8314 euros)", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-07T19:01:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-07T19:15:50.001+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
