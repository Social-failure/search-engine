Indian media said Delhi would instead opt for home-made anti-tank missiles.\n“If there is a problem, it can, it should and it will be solved,” said Daniel Carmon, Israel’s ambassador to India referring to the cancellation of the defense deal.\nIndia is Israel’s biggest arms market, buying around $1 billion worth of weapons every year. Despite the cancellation of the missile deal, India’s Defence Ministry said this month it had cleared a plan worth $72 million to buy 131 Barak surface-to-air missiles built by Rafael.\nThe two countries have grown closer since Narendra Modi became Indian prime minister in 2014, widening commercial cooperation beyond their longstanding defense ties.\nNetanyahu will be accompanied by a 130-member delegation drawn from the cyber and agriculture sectors as well as from defense. As well as New Delhi, they will also visit India’s financial capital Mumbai and Modi’s home-state of Gujarat.\n“The intention of the prime minister and the whole delegation is to boost trade, investment and tourism between both countries,” said Gilad Cohen, deputy director-general for Asia and the Pacific in Israel’s foreign ministry.\nDeals for gas and oil cooperation, cyber security and agricultural projects are on the agenda.\nPALESTINIANS The trip comes about half a year after Modi became the first sitting Indian prime minister to visit Israel. On that trip Modi did not travel to the occupied West Bank to meet Palestinian leaders, as visiting leaders usually do..\nHowever, India was among more than 120 countries last month to vote in favor of a resolution calling for the United States to drop its recent recognition of Jerusalem as Israel’s capital.\nThe status of Jerusalem is one of the thorniest obstacles to a peace deal between Israel and the Palestinians, who want East Jerusalem as the capital of a future state.\nCarmon said India’s vote against Israel at the U.N. General Assembly on the Jerusalem issue would not affect bilateral ties.\n“The vote at the UN is important, but it will not mar the big picture of the India-Israel relationship,” he said.\nForeign policy experts in New Delhi said Modi had made significant changes in diplomatic and strategic ties with Israel while at the same time retaining links with Palestinian leader Mahmoud Abbas.\nBefore Modi visited Israel in July 2017 he hosted Abbas in India and offered help in health and information technology, but the trip was low-key.\nAdditional reporting Maayan Lubell in Jerusalem, Editing by Gareth Jones\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-12T16:43:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-12T16:49:20.001+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
