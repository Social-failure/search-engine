Someone who can teach me new things and inspire me,” El-Hassan wrote on her dating profile. \nShe sent messages to him on the WhatsApp messaging service with links to websites with details on making ricin. He sent back her graphic videos of IS beheadings, shootings and killing prisoners using explosives. \nWhen police arrested him in Dec. 2016, Mohammed, who worked in a food factory making meals for supermarkets, possessed instruction manuals on mobile phone detonators, ricin and how to make explosives, prosecutors said. \nHe had also contacted an IS commander via Facebook and offered to carry out a “lone actor” mission. \nMohammed, who the BBC reported was Eritrean-born and had come to Britain from Sudan as an asylum seeker, and El-Hassan were both found guilty of preparing for act of terrorism at London’s Old Bailey court and will be sentenced next month.
