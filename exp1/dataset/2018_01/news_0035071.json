On Saturday, the PGA presidents announced that the film would be the first to implement these guidelines at the Producers Guild of America Awards. \nWhile the anti-sexual harassment guidelines are considered “best practices” and compliance is voluntary, the PGA hopes they will help those in the film industry to recognize and curb sexual harassment both on set and off. PGA presidents Gary Lucchesi and Lori McCreary explained that “sexual harassment can no longer be tolerated in our industry or within the ranks of the Producers Guild membership.” \nRead: Time’s Up: What Makes Hollywood’s New Anti-Harassment Initiative So Revolutionary \nTheir statement continues: “We are in a transitional moment as a society, in which we are re-evaluating behavior in the workplace and beyond. Producers possess authority both on and off the set, and can provide key leadership in creating and sustaining work environments that are built on mutual respect.” The recommendations included in the guidelines cover reporting procedures, sexual harassment training, and victim and witness protocols. \nRead: Like It or Not, Lists of ‘Shitty Men’ Are Going to Keep Circulating \nThe Wonder Woman 2 production’s decision to participate is particularly noteworthy both for the powerful feminist ideals espoused by the franchise, but perhaps more importantly due to the film’s November decision to part ways with its producer Brett Ratner, who has been accused of sexual harassment by a number of women.
