Adjusted net income of $35 million, or $0.60 per diluted share. Net interest income grew $4 million, or 4 percent, from third quarter 2017, led by higher earning assets. Average commercial loans up $344 million, or 9 percent, from last quarter. Net gain on loan sales rose to $79 million, driven by an improved gain on sale margin. Asset quality strong with a high allowance coverage ratio. Strong capital position with Tier 1 leverage at 8.51 percent.\nFlagstar Bancorp, Inc. (NYSE: FBC), the holding company for Flagstar Bank, FSB, today reported a fourth quarter 2017 net loss of $45 million, or $0.79 per diluted share, and adjusted net income of $35 million, or $0.60 per diluted share, after adjusting for a non-cash charge to the provision for income taxes of $80 million, or $1.37 per diluted share. As previously announced, the charge resulted from the revaluation of the Company's net deferred tax asset under the new Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. The Company reported net income of $40 million, or $0.70 per diluted share, in the third quarter 2017, and $28 million, or $0.49 per diluted share, in the fourth quarter 2016.\n\"A key take-away from the quarter was the durability of our earnings,\" said Alessandro DiNello, president and chief executive officer of Flagstar Bancorp, Inc. \"The continued growth of our banking and servicing businesses has reduced the impact of the swings in the origination business on our earnings, thus producing more predictable and consistent results.\n\"All three of our business lines strengthened during the quarter. Our community bank drove a 9 percent increase in commercial loans, which helped fuel earning asset growth of $642 million -- a 4 percent gain. Our mortgage acquisitions earlier in 2017 continued to pay dividends, producing a 14 percent increase in closings and a 42 percent increase in locks over the same quarter last year in the face of a smaller market. And our third key business line, servicing, continued to gain scale and now has a book of business that exceeds 440,000 accounts.\"\n\"Finally, I am pleased to announce that we have received approval from the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency to acquire eight Desert Community Bank branches from East West Bank. With this franchise, we acquire $600 million in deposits and $70 million in loan relationships. We are looking forward to welcoming the Desert Community Bank branch team to Flagstar by the end of the quarter.\"\nFull year 2017 net income was $63 million, or $1.09 per diluted share, as compared to full year 2016 net income of $171 million, or $2.66 per diluted share. Excluding the tax charge in the fourth quarter 2017, the Company had adjusted 2017 net income of $143 million, or $2.47 per diluted share, as compared to adjusted 2016 net income of $155 million, or $2.38 per diluted share. On an adjusted basis, the Company realized a 4 percent increase in diluted earnings per share for the full year 2017.\nFourth Quarter 2017 Highlights:\nIncome Statement Highlights\nThree Months Ended\nDecember 31,\nSeptember 30,\nJune 30,\nMarch 31,\nDecember 31,\n2017\n2017\n2017\n2017\n2016\n(Dollars in millions)\nNet interest income\n$\n107\n$\n103\n$\n97\n$\n83\n$\n87\nProvision (benefit) for loan losses\n2\n2\n(1)\n3\n1\nNoninterest income\n124\n130\n116\n100\n98\nNoninterest expense\n178\n171\n154\n140\n142\nIncome before income taxes\n51\n60\n60\n40\n42\nProvision for income taxes (1)\n96\n20\n19\n13\n14\nNet income (loss)\n$\n(45)\n$\n40\n$\n41\n$\n27\n$\n28\nIncome (loss) per share:\nBasic\n$\n(0.79)\n$\n0.71\n$\n0.72\n$\n0.47\n$\n0.50\nDiluted\n$\n(0.79)\n$\n0.70\n$\n0.71\n$\n0.46\n$\n0.49\n(1)\nFor the three months ended December 31, 2017 includes an $80 million non-cash charge to the provision for income taxes resulting from the revaluation of the Company's net deferred tax asset (DTA) at a lower statutory rate as a result of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.\nKey Ratios\nThree Months Ended\nChange (bps)\nDecember 31,\nSeptember 30,\nJune 30,\nMarch 31,\nDecember 31,\n2017\n2017\n2017\n2017\n2016\nSeq\nYr/Yr\nNet interest margin\n2.76\n%\n2.78\n%\n2.77\n%\n2.67\n%\n2.67\n%\n(2)\n9\nReturn on average assets\n(1.1)\n%\n1.0\n%\n1.0\n%\n0.8\n%\n0.8\n%\nN/M\nN/M\nReturn on average equity\n(12.1)\n%\n11.1\n%\n11.6\n%\n7.9\n%\n8.6\n%\nN/M\nN/M\nReturn on average common\nequity\n(12.1)\n%\n11.1\n%\n11.6\n%\n7.9\n%\n8.6\n%\nN/M\nN/M\nEfficiency ratio\n77.1\n%\n73.5\n%\n72.0\n%\n76.8\n%\n76.7\n%\n360\n40\nN/M - Not meaningful\nBalance Sheet Highlights\nThree Months Ended\n% Change\nDecember 31,\nSeptember 30,\nJune 30,\nMarch 31,\nDecember 31,\n2017\n2017\n2017\n2017\n2016\nSeq\nYr/Yr\n(Dollars in millions)\nAverage Balance Sheet Data\nAverage interest-earning assets\n$\n15,379\n$\n14,737\n$\n14,020\n$\n12,343\n$\n12,817\n4\n%\n20\n%\nAverage loans held-for-sale\n(LHFS)\n4,537\n4,476\n4,269\n3,286\n3,321\n1\n%\n37\n%\nAverage loans held-for-\ninvestment (LHFI)\n7,295\n6,803\n6,224\n5,639\n6,163\n7\n%\n18\n%\nAverage total deposits\n9,084\n9,005\n8,739\n8,795\n9,233\n1\n%\n(2)\n%\nNet Interest Income\nNet interest income rose $4 million, or 4 percent, to $107 million for the fourth quarter 2017, as compared to $103 million for the third quarter 2017. The results reflected a 4 percent increase in average earning assets, led by continued solid growth in commercial loans. The net interest margin decreased 2 basis points to 2.76 percent for the fourth quarter 2017, as compared to the third quarter 2017, on continued deposit price discipline.\nLoans held-for-investment averaged $7.3 billion for the fourth quarter 2017, an increase of $492 million, or 7 percent, from the prior quarter. During the fourth quarter 2017, average commercial loans rose 9 percent with average commercial real estate loans increasing $220 million, or 13 percent, average commercial and industrial loans increasing $63 million, or 6 percent, and average warehouse loans increasing $61 million, or 6 percent.\nAverage total deposits were $9.1 billion in the fourth quarter 2017, increasing $79 million, or 1 percent from the third quarter 2017. The increase was led by higher company-controlled and government deposits. Average retail deposits were unchanged at $6.5 billion as higher retail certificates of deposit (up $215 million, or 18 percent) offset a decline in retail savings deposits (down $217 million, or 6 percent).\nProvision (Benefit) for Loan Losses\nThe provision for loan losses totaled $2 million for the fourth quarter 2017, unchanged from the third quarter 2017. The low level of provision expense reflected continued strong asset quality and largely matched net charge-offs in the quarter.\nNoninterest Income\nNoninterest income fell $6 million, or 5 percent, to $124 million in the fourth quarter of 2017, as compared to $130 million for the third quarter 2017. The decrease was primarily due to a net loss on the mortgage servicing rights, partially offset by an increase in net gain on loan sales.\nFourth quarter 2017 net gain on loan sales increased to $79 million, as compared to $75 million in the third quarter 2017. The increase from the prior quarter reflected an improved gain on sale margin. The net gain on loan sale margin increased 7 basis points to 0.91 percent for the fourth quarter 2017, as compared to 0.84 percent for the third quarter 2017. Fallout-adjusted locks fell 3 percent to $8.6 billion primarily due to anticipated seasonal factors, partially offset by stronger correspondent volume. Full year 2017 fallout-adjusted locks rose a strong 42 percent, boosted by the acquisition of Opes and Stearns.\nMortgage Metrics\nThree Months Ended\nChange (% / bps)\nDecember 31,\nSeptember 30,\nJune 30,\nMarch 31,\nDecember 31,\n2017\n2017\n2017\n2017\n2016\nSeq\nYr/Yr\n(Dollars in millions)\nMortgage rate lock commitments (fallout-\nadjusted) (1)\n$\n8,631\n$\n8,898\n$\n9,002\n$\n5,996\n$\n6,091\n(3)\n%\n42\n%\nNet margin on mortgage rate lock\ncommitments (fallout-adjusted) (1) (2)\n0.91\n%\n0.84\n%\n0.73\n%\n0.80\n%\n0.93\n%\n7\n(2)\nNet gain on loan sales\n$\n79\n75\n$\n66\n$\n48\n$\n57\n5\n%\n39\n%\nNet (loss) return on the mortgage servicing\nrights (MSR)\n$\n(4)\n$\n6\n$\n6\n$\n14\n$\n(5)\nN/M\n(20)\n%\nGain on loan sales + net (loss) return on\nthe MSR\n$\n75\n$\n81\n$\n72\n$\n62\n$\n52\n(7)\n%\n44\n%\nResidential loans serviced (number of\naccounts - 000's) (3)\n442\n415\n402\n393\n383\n7\n%\n15\n%\nCapitalized value of mortgage servicing\nrights\n1.16\n%\n1.15\n%\n1.14\n%\n1.10\n%\n1.07\n%\n1\n9\nN/M - Not meaningful\n(1)\nFallout-adjusted mortgage rate lock commitments are adjusted by a percentage of mortgage loans in the pipeline that are not expected to close based on previous historical experience and the level of interest rates.\n(2)\nGain on sale margin is based on net gain on loan sales (excludes net gain on loan sales of $1 million from loans transferred from HFI in three months ended December 31, 2017) to fallout-adjusted mortgage rate lock commitments.\n(3)\nIncludes loans serviced for own loan portfolio, serviced for others, and subserviced for others.\nNet return on the mortgage servicing rights (including the impact of hedges) was a net loss of $4 million for the fourth quarter 2017, as compared to a net gain of $6 million for the third quarter 2017. The decrease from the prior quarter largely reflected a $4 million decrease in fair value driven by model changes as well as a $3 million charge associated with pending MSR sales with a fair value of $98 million expected to close in the first quarter 2018. Assuming the Capital Simplification NPR is finalized as proposed, taking this action gives the Company significant flexibility in managing the MSR asset in 2018.\nThe representation and warranty benefit was $2 million for the fourth quarter 2017, as compared to a $4 million benefit in the third quarter 2017. The representation and warranty reserve was reduced to $15 million at December 31, 2017, from $16 million at September 30, 2017, reflecting continued improvement in risk trends and a repurchase pipeline that was only $3 million at December 31, 2017.\nNoninterest Expense\nNoninterest expense rose to $178 million for the fourth quarter 2017, as compared to $171 million for the third quarter 2017. During the fourth quarter 2017, compensation and benefits increased $3 million due to incentive compensation. The Company also experienced a $2 million increase in expenses to support the investment in growth initiatives, included in compensation and benefits and other noninterest expense. The Company's efficiency ratio was 77 percent for the fourth quarter 2017, as compared to 74 percent for the third quarter 2017.\nIncome Taxes\nThe fourth quarter 2017 provision for income taxes totaled $96 million, including a one-time, non-cash charge of $80 million resulting from new tax legislation, as compared to $20 million in the third quarter 2017. Excluding this charge, the Company's adjusted effective tax rate was 32 percent for the fourth quarter 2017, unchanged from the third quarter 2017.\nAsset Quality\nCredit Quality Ratios\nThree Months Ended\nChange (% / bps)\nDecember 31,\nSeptember 30,\nJune 30,\nMarch 31,\nDecember 31,\n2017\n2017\n2017\n2017\n2016\nSeq\nYr/Yr\n(Dollars in millions)\nAllowance for loan loss to LHFI\n1.8\n%\n2.0\n%\n2.1\n%\n2.4\n%\n2.4\n%\n(20)\n(60)\nAllowance for loan loss to LHFI and loans with\ngovernment guarantees\n1.8\n%\n1.9\n%\n2.0\n%\n2.3\n%\n2.2\n%\n(10)\n(40)\nCharge-offs, net of recoveries\n$\n2\n$\n2\n$\n—\n$\n4\n$\n2\n—\n—\n%\nCharge-offs associated with loans with\ngovernment guarantees\n1\n1\n—\n2\n1\n—\n—\n%\nCharge-offs associated with the sale or transfer of\nnonperforming loans and TDRs\n—\n—\n—\n1\n—\n—\n—\nCharge-offs, net of recoveries, adjusted (1)\n$\n1\n$\n1\n$\n—\n$\n1\n$\n1\n$\n—\n—\n%\nTotal nonperforming loans held-for-investment\n$\n29\n$\n31\n$\n30\n$\n28\n$\n40\n(6)\n%\n(28)\n%\nNet charge-offs to LHFI ratio (annualized)\n0.11\n%\n0.08\n%\n0.04\n%\n0.27\n%\n0.13\n%\n3\n(2)\nNet charge-off ratio, adjusted (annualized)\n0.06\n%\n0.06\n%\n0.02\n%\n0.07\n%\n0.07\n%\n—\n(1)\nRatio of nonperforming LHFI to LHFI\n0.38\n%\n0.44\n%\n0.44\n%\n0.47\n%\n0.67\n%\n(6)\n(29)\nN/M - Not meaningful\n(1)\nExcludes charge-offs associated with loans with government guarantees and charge-offs associated with the sale or transfer of nonperforming loans and TDRs.\nThe allowance for loan losses was $140 million at December 31, 2017, unchanged from September 30, 2017.

At December 31, 2017, the Company had a Tier 1 leverage ratio of 8.51 percent, as compared to 8.80 percent at September 30, 2017. The decrease in the ratio resulted primarily from balance sheet growth.\nOn September 27, 2017, the federal banking agencies issued a notice of proposed rulemaking (\"NPR\") regarding several proposed simplifications of the Basel III capital rules issued in 2013. This Capital Simplification NPR would accelerate capital formation for balance sheet growth. On a pro-forma basis at December 31, 2017, the proposal would have increased the Company's Tier 1 leverage ratio by approximately 70 bps and risk-based capital ratios by approximately 30-35 basis points.\nAt December 31, 2017, the Company had a common equity-to-assets ratio of 8.27 percent.\nEarnings Conference Call\nAs previously announced, the Company's fourth quarter 2017 earnings call will be held Tuesday, January 23, 2018 at 11 a.m. (ET).\nTo join the call, please dial (800) 289-0517 toll free or (323) 794-2423 and use passcode 8848543.

On January 1, 2015, the Basel III rules became effective, subject to transition provisions primarily related to regulatory deductions and adjustments impacting common equity Tier 1 capital and Tier 1 capital. We have transitioned to the Basel III framework beginning in January 2015 and are subject to a phase-in period extending through 2018. Accordingly, the calculations provided below are estimates. These measures are considered to be non-GAAP financial measures because they are not formally defined by GAAP and the Basel III implementation regulations will not be fully phased-in until January 1, 2019. The federal banking regulators have issued a series of new proposals regarding regulatory capital which may freeze or eliminate most of the transitional rules. The regulations are subject to change as clarifying guidance becomes available and the calculations currently include our interpretations of the requirements including informal feedback received through the regulatory process. Other entities may calculate the Basel III ratios differently from ours based on their interpretation of the guidelines. Since analysts and banking regulators may assess our capital adequacy using the Basel III framework, we believe that it is useful to provide investors information enabling them to assess our capital adequacy on the same basis.\nDecember 31, 2017\nCommon Equity\nTier 1 Leverage (to\nTier 1 Capital (to\nTotal Risk-Based\nTier 1 (to Risk\nAdjusted Tangible\nRisk Weighted\nCapital (to Risk\nWeighted Assets)\nAssets)\nAssets)\nWeighted Assets)\n(Dollars in millions)\n(Unaudited)\nFlagstar Bancorp (the Company)\nRegulatory capital – Basel III (transitional) to Basel III (fully\nphased-in)\nBasel III (transitional)\n$\n1,216\n$\n1,442\n$\n1,442\n$\n1,576\nIncreased deductions related to deferred tax assets, mortgage\nservicing rights and other capital components\n(16)\n(1)\n(1)\n(2)\nBasel III (fully phased-in) capital\n$\n1,200\n$\n1,441\n$\n1,441\n$\n1,574\nRisk-weighted assets – Basel III (transitional) to Basel III\n(fully phased-in)\nBasel III assets (transitional)\n$\n10,579\n$\n16,951\n$\n10,579\n$\n10,579\nNet change in assets\n(2)\n(1)\n(2)\n(2)\nBasel III (fully phased-in) assets\n$\n10,577\n$\n16,950\n$\n10,577\n$\n10,577\nCapital ratios\nBasel III (transitional)\n11.50\n%\n8.51\n%\n13.63\n%\n14.90\n%\nBasel III (fully phased-in adjusted for transition freeze)\n11.35\n%\n8.50\n%\n13.62\n%\n14.88\n%\nDecember 31, 2017\nCommon Equity\nTier 1 Leverage (to\nTier 1 Capital (to\nTotal Risk-Based\nTier 1 (to Risk\nAdjusted Tangible\nRisk Weighted\nCapital (to Risk\nWeighted Assets)\nAssets)\nAssets)\nWeighted Assets)\nFlagstar Bank (the Bank)\n(Dollars in millions)\n(Unaudited)\nRegulatory capital – Basel III (transitional) to Basel III (fully\nphased-in)\nBasel III (transitional)\n$\n1,531\n$\n1,531\n$\n1,531\n$\n1,664\nIncreased deductions related to deferred tax assets, mortgage\nservicing rights and other capital components\n(1)\n(1)\n(1)\n—\nBasel III (fully phased-in) capital\n$\n1,530\n$\n1,530\n$\n1,530\n$\n1,664\nRisk-weighted assets – Basel III (transitional) to Basel III (fully\nphased-in)\nBasel III assets (transitional)\n$\n10,589\n$\n16,934\n$\n10,589\n$\n10,589\nNet change in assets\n(1)\n(1)\n(1)\n(1)\nBasel III (fully phased-in) assets\n$\n10,588\n$\n16,933\n$\n10,588\n$\n10,588\nCapital ratios\nBasel III (transitional)\n14.46\n%\n9.04\n%\n14.46\n%\n15.72\n%\nBasel III (fully phased-in adjusted for transition freeze)\n14.45\n%\n9.04\n%\n14.45\n%\n15.71\n%\nTangible book value per share, adjusted net income and adjusted earnings per share.
