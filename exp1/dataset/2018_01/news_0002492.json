We look forward to working with business and government to make this new disclosure requirement work as effectively as possible,\" he said.\nLuke Hildyard, Stewardship and Corporate Governance Policy Lead at the Pensions and Lifetime Savings Association , said just 7 percent of FTSE 100 annual reports detailed the difference between the CEO's pay and that of the wider workforce.\n\"Huge pay differences between executives and the wider workforce symbolise how too many companies fail to understand or appreciate the value of their workers,\" he said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-04T03:26:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-04T03:26:17.008+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
