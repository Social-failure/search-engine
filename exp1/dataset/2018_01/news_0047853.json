Davidson & Co analyst Steven Chercover said. \nBy adding mills, WestRock would be grabbing some of the scarce assets, Chercover added. \nWestRock said the deal was valued at about $4.9 billion, including assumption of KapStone’s net debt of about $1.36 billion. \nThe equity value is based on 98.7 million diluted outstanding shares of KapStone as of Sept. 30, according to Reuters calculation. \nThe deal, which is set to close in the quarter ending Sept. 30, is expected to immediately add to WestRock’s adjusted earnings and cash flow and generate savings of about $200 million by the end of fiscal 2021, the companies said. \nNorcross, Georgia-based WestRock said the deal would help it expand in the western United States and broaden its portfolio of paper grades, allowing it to tap into the kraft bag market when plastic is being banned. \nWestRock, created in 2015 by the $16 billion merger of MeadWestvaco and Rock-Tenn, said it expects the deal to boost margins in its North American corrugated packaging business, used in the industrial and consumer end-markets. \nNorthbrook, Illinois-based KapStone, which produces containerboard, unbleached kraft paper and corrugated products, will be integrated into WestRock’s corrugated packaging business. \nSeparately, WestRock said sales in its first quarter jumped about 13 percent on higher price and shipments. \nThe company said it would fund the deal through issuance of new debt under a fully committed financing package and expects to refinance KapStone’s debt. \nLazard and Wells Fargo are WestRock’s financial advisers while Rothschild & Co and Moelis & Co LLC advised KapStone.
