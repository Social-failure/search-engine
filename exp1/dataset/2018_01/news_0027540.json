It last erupted in 2014, spewing lava and forcing thousands of people to evacuate.\nRenato Solidum, chief of the Philippine Institute of Volcanology and Seismology (Phivolcs), described Mayon’s current activity as a non-explosive magmatic eruption, but he would not rule out a more dangerous volcanic explosion in coming days.\n“What we would like to see is if there would be enough pressure, gas pressure for the next magma that would go up,” he told ABS-CBN News Channel.\nPhivolcs raised the volcano alert to level 3 late on Sunday after detecting the lava flow.\nSolidum said raising the alert to level 4, under which the danger zone would be expanded and a hazardous eruption could happen within a few days, depended on how Mayon behaved in the next few hours.\nLevel 5 indicates an eruption is in progress.\nPeople have been advised to stay away from a 6-km (4-mile) radius Permanent Danger Zone and a 7-km Expanded Danger Zone on the volcano’s southern flank.
