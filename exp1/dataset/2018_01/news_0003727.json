It received over 14 billion euros worth of orders, lead bankers for the deal said.\nBond yields across the single currency bloc were flat to 6 bps lower on Thursday, having traded 1-2 basis points higher in early trade.\nThe periphery led the falls, with Spain’s 10-year bond yield down 5 bps at 1.55 percent and set for its biggest one-day fall since early November.\nThat pushed the gap over German Bund yields briefly to around 109 bps, its tightest in almost a week.\nThe gains in Spain’s bond markets spilled over to its peripheral peers, with Portugal’s 10-year bond yield down 6 bps at 1.94 percent.\nIn Germany, the bloc’s benchmark bond issuer, 10-year bond yields edged lower to 0.435 percent.\nAnalysts said trading volumes had been slightly lower on Wednesday as sweeping new financial rules, known as the Markets in Financial Instruments Directive II, came into force.\nBut they added that the strong Irish sale had cheered investors, providing an incentive to push yields down.\nMinutes from the Federal Reserve’s December meeting released late on Wednesday showed Fed policymakers see future rate rises guided by inflation and fiscal stimulus.\n“We think the discussion at the Fed indicates little opposition to raising rates in March and to pressing ahead with balance sheet reduction thanks to easy financial conditions,” analysts at Mizuho said in a note.\nReporting by Dhara Ranasinghe; Editing by Alison Williams\n ", "external_links": ["http://tmsnrt.rs/2ii2Bqr", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-01-04T20:14:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-04T21:11:10.040+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
