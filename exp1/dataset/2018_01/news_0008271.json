The bacteria can be found in animal products including cold cut meats, poultry and unpasteurised milk, as well as fresh fruits and vegetables. \nThe disease can cause flu-like symptoms and diarrhoea, and in more severe cases spread from the intestine to the blood, causing bloodstream infections, or to the central nervous system, causing meningitis. \nAnelich said a listeriosis strain known as ST6 had been identified in nine out of 10 of the South African cases. \nThat should make tracing the source easier, “because now we know that it probably originates from one processing facility”. \nA health department official said the strain was not drug-resistant and that the deaths were due to delays in diagnosis, meaning cases were not treated in time.
