Many protesters have barricaded themselves in. \n“The Notre-Dame-des-Landes airport will be abandoned,” Philippe said. “This is the logical decision given the dead-end in which this project has found itself.” \nSupporters of Notre-Dame-Des-Landes, which had been designed to handle 4 million passengers a year initially, said it would aid economic development in the Loire-Atlantique region. They argued an old, inner-city airport 30 km (19 miles) to the south was congested and a security risk. \nBut opponents said it was too costly, environmentally unfriendly and that there was another under-utilised airport 110 km to the north near Rennes in Brittany. \nThe environment issue weighed heavily, with President Emmanuel Macron having championed the fight against climate change since his election, with promises to “make our planet great again”. \nConstruction giant Vinci said it was ready to discuss government compensation for loss of the contract to build and operate the new airport for 55 years. Independent experts have said the company could stand to receive up to 350 million euros -- a sum the government questioned on Wednesday. \nPlans for a “Great West” transatlantic gateway to France and Europe were first mooted in the 1960s and the Notre-Dame-Des-Landes site identified in 1967, but the project stalled until the Socialist government of Lionel Jospin revived it in 2000. \nEarly adverts for the airport boasted “Nantes to New York by Concorde” and after years of indecision, political squabbling and consultations, the project got the go-ahead in 2008, years after France and Britain took the Concorde out of service. \nBut opposition to the plans grew as local farmers, environmental activists and anti-capitalists joined forces.

In 2012, riot police pulled back after an evacuation effort turned violent. \n“(It would be) absurd to drop the project but pursue a strategy or repression and expel the people who took care of this land,” the protesters said in a statement issued shortly before Philippe’s announcement.
