If Europe can continue demonstrating earnings growth at index level as an asset class it will be very attractive,” he added. \nIn other big moves, the restructuring French telecoms and cable firm Altice tumbled 5.8 percent, extending Wednesday’s slide, after its U.S. unit announced a $500 million junk bond sale. \nChipmaker STMicro gained 3.2 percent after Credit Suisse upgraded the stock to ‘outperform’, saying margins for the iPhone supplier would continue to expand. \nSodexo also fell victim to disappointing results, its shares down 3 percent after the firm reported a slow start to its first quarter.
