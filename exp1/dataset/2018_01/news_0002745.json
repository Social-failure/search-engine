The children were found safe inside the car. \n“Our whole goal was to bring these two sisters home safe,” Round Rock Police Chief Allen Banks told a news conference on Wednesday night. \nThe girls, Luluvioletta “Lulu” Bandera-Magret and Lilianais “Lily” Griffith, were being examined at a Colorado hospital and are expected to return soon to Texas, Banks said.
