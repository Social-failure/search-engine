Part of that has been changes to the labor law. \nMore protesters arrived as a group unfurled a huge banner that read “Hands off strikes, it’s a labor right!”, hanging it from the roof of the ministry on a busy street in central Athens. \nGreece’s leftist-led government was due to submit a bill with bailout-mandated reforms to parliament on Tuesday. The government has agreed to increase the quorum for unions to vote on a strike. \nLawmakers are expected to vote on the reforms before a meeting of euro zone finance ministers on Jan 22, which will assess the country’s bailout progress as part of a review by its lenders.
