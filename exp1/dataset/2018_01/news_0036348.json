The $110.1 million deal left TGLT with 82.32 percent of Caputo’s share capital and voting rights.\n“We are very positive on the Argentine construction and real estate markets,” Weil said.\nThe plans to offer shares come as President Mauricio Macri’s government is stimulating the real estate market through subsidized mortgage credits. Since his election in late 2015, Macri has gotten rid of heavy handed currency and trade controls that scared off private investment during the previous administration.\nThe construction sector has surged in part thanks to public works investment, which could rise 60 percent this year as a result of public-private partnerships.\nLast August, TGLT raised $150 million through an international sale of 10-year bonds.
