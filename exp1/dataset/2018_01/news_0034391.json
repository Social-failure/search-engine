This is, I would say, the heavy artillery of our supervisory system.” \nThe mission was mandated by the ILO’s governing body in November and will report back in March. The governing body, comprising 28 governments, 14 employers’ representatives and 14 workers’ representatives, could decide to set up a commission of inquiry, Ryder said. \n“To give you some perspective, that was the process that eventually was used in the case of Myanmar over forced labor a decade ago. It’s been used on some of the causes celebres in the past – one thinks of Zimbabwe in the worst days, Belarus.” \nAn ILO commission of inquiry would be able to make recommendations of “any nature whatsoever”, with the aim of ensuring Venezuela meets its obligations under the ILO convention on the freedom of association, Ryder said. \nFedecamaras has long been at odds with President Nicolas Maduro’s government and played a major role against the government of his predecessor Hugo Chavez in 2002, when its head briefly became interim president. \nThe mission has the cooperation of the government and a program of meetings is being worked on, Ryder said.
