He met with Yousafzai in Beirut on Saturday where they visited students. \n“Through both their innovations and philanthropy, Apple has helped educate and empower people around the world,” she said in a statement. “I am grateful that Apple knows the value of investing in girls and is joining Malala Fund in the fight to ensure all girls can learn and lead without fear.” \nYousafzai is scheduled to speak at the World Economic Forum in Davos , Switzerland Thursday.
