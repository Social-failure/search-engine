The fairytale continues for me. After the great year I had last year, it’s incredible.” \nAddressing the fans, he added: “You guys make me nervous. You guys make me practice. You guys fill the stadiums. Thank you.” \nEarlier, Croatia’s Mate Pavic and Canada’s Gabriela Dabrowski beat India’s Rohan Bopanna and Timea Babos of Hungary 2-6 6-4 (11-9) to win the mixed doubles title.
