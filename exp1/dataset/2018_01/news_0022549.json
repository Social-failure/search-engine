Nonetheless, we still see him as a defender who has potential for further development,” Dortmund’s sporting director Michael Zorc said. \nThe 22-year-old Akanji, who has four won caps for Switzerland, featured in all Basel’s Champions League group matches this season and is eligible to play for Dortmund in the Europa League. \n“The discussions I’ve had with those responsible at Borussia Dortmund made me feel comfortable. In that respect it was a decision of the heart. And I’ve always enjoyed the football they play in Dortmund,” Akanji said. \nDortmund are fourth in the Bundesliga and face Hertha Berlin on Friday.
