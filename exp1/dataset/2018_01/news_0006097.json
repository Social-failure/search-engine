Gaza’s sole power station generates only a small amount of power.\nPrompted partly by Abbas’s sanctions and fears of financial and political isolation, Hamas signed an Egyptian-brokered reconciliation agreement with his Fatah movement in October and agreed to hand over administrative control of the Gaza Strip to the Palestinian Authority.\nBut both groups have failed to finalize details of the deal, which had been due to be completed on December 1. The Authority’s decision to resume the electricity payments could help smooth the way towards completing the accord.\nThe resumption of power delivery comes at a time of heightened Israeli-Palestinian tensions.\nPalestinians have been mounting protests in the occupied West Bank and violence has flared along the Israel-Gaza border since U.S. President Donald Trump announced on December 6 that he was recognizing Jerusalem as Israel’s capital.\nPalestinians want East Jerusalem as the capital of a state they seek to establish in the occupied West Bank and the Gaza Strip.\nAdditional reporting by Nidal al-Mughrabi in Gaza, Writing by Ori Lewis; Editing by Elaine Hardcastle\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-01-08T04:27:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-08T00:22:37.014+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
