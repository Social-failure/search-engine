It’s only once every four years. It’s not going to be a scheduling matter. It just seems they seem reticent to try and get involved.”\nThe Indian board has not been keen on cricket’s Olympic inclusion partly because of apprehensions that BCCI might lose its autonomy and be answerable to the country’s Olympic committee.\nFormer Australia captain Ricky Ponting, who is part of the 14-person independent committee along with Sri Lankan Kumar Sangakkara, Indian Sourav Ganguly and Rod Marsh of Australia, said the sport must be represented by its best players at the Olympics.\n“We’re very conscious of not lessening the product we’re putting out,” Ponting said.\n”If cricket makes it into the Olympics it has to be the best players and showcasing the sport for what it is.\n“The players would want it because of how beneficial they would see that being for the game going forward.”\nThe independent committee also discussed the wage gap in the international game, making helmets compulsory and DRS technology among a variety of other topics.
