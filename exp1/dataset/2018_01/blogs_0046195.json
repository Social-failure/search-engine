Funds were misused to pay for a home, antiques, fine art, jewelry and travel, the CFTC said.\nThe CFTC filed the lawsuit under seal on Jan. 16, the same day a federal judge issued a temporary restraining order freezing the defendants’ assets.\nAdam Tracy, a lawyer for the company, said “the allegations contained in the CFTC’s complaint are just that, allegations, and I’ll be working with client in coming days to formulate a response to the complaint.”\nThe lawsuit came amid growing governmental action around the world against virtual currencies amid heightened fears globally over the risks that bitcoin and other virtual currencies may pose to investors and the global financial system.\nCFTC Enforcement Director James McDonald in a statement on Tuesday said his agency is “actively policing the virtual currency markets.” The regulator last week announced two other lawsuits against virtual currency companies.\n“We caution potential virtual currency customers, once again, that they should engage in appropriate diligence before purchasing virtual currencies,” McDonald said.\nReporting by Susan Heavey; Editing by Phil Berlowitz and Tom Brown\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-24T16:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-24T16:43:23.004+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
