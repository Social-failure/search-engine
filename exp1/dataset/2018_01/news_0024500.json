Its coca growing area expanded 14 percent in 2016. \nBolivia is the world’s third-largest producer of the leaf behind Peru and Colombia, whose coca-growing area also increased in 2016. \n“Sooner or later, the coca leaf must be able to enter countries all around the world legally and cleanly,” Morales, a socialist whose bid to run for a fourth term in office in next year’s election has sparked protests, said at the event. “We can demonstrate that coca is a nutrient and a medicine.” \nLeaders of producers’ groups said they distributed some 10,000 pounds of coca leaves to drivers and spectators at the ceremony, under grey skies outside the Hernando Siles stadium. \n“It is something typical of the area, and to tell you the truth it was a novelty for us,” said driver Oscar Romero. \nDefending champion Stephane Peterhansel led the racers into Bolivia but Peugeot team mate Carlos Sainz had trimmed the Frenchman’s lead with his first stage win of this year’s event. \nPeterhansel ended the sixth stage from the Peruvian city of Arequipa to La Paz with a 27-minute advantage over the Spaniard, a two-times world rally champion and father of the Formula One driver with the same name. \nEarlier in the day, police cleared a group of demonstrators who had been blocking the road where drivers were set to arrive in protest against government spending on the race and Morales’ re-election bid. \nFriday is a rest stage in La Paz.
