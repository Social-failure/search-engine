When I look at him, he is the people’s hero not the corporate hero because of the way he is on court. \n”Nick is clever and there is no way he won’t pay attention to who is in the stadium. For example he will have Laver and (Ken) Rosewall and will think ‘Oh man they are all watching, maybe I better be careful what I say, have to clean up my act’. \n“It definitely bothers him. I don’ think I’ve seen him win a match on Rod Laver. He played Andy Murray once there and after a set he said ‘I‘m dead mate’ and couldn’t move his legs.” \nWilander said Kyrgios thrives in a chaotic environment as was demonstrated in his matches on Hisense, where he swore at a fan during the encounter against Dutra Silva and then was heckled against Troicki. \n”Nick likes to be disruptive, it’s the way he plays,“ Wilander said. ”Opponents can get distracted by his tactics. \n”But I think he’s less disruptive the more organized the surroundings are, that’s the problem. \n“You have to show up emotionally against Tsonga, he can’t afford to go in there flat, which could happen in Laver.” \nDespite his misgivings, Wilander says Kyrgios is the favorite in what will be his second meeting with the player he describes as his idol. \n”If he shows up mentally he is the favorite,“ he said. ”Tsonga played better when he was behind (against Denis Shapovalov) in the previous round. \n“But I don’t think that’s enough against Kyrgios. I think Nick is one size too big for Jo.” Reporting by Martyn Herman, editing by Pritha Sarkar", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-18T16:03:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-18T16:09:17.001+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
