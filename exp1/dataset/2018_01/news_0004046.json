The cargo might be blended with other components to meet the U.S. winter specifications for heating oil, they added.\nA third cargo, STI Donald C Traus has also been booked by Gazprom from Primorsk with options to go on the transatlantic route.\nThe United States has in recent years become a major exporter of refined oil products, supplying large volumes of diesel to Europe, where regional refineries can not meet local demand.\nBut an Arctic front that hit eastern United States has led to a sharp rise in demand for diesel, used in many states for heating, offering traders what is known as a reverse arbitrage.\nAnother major winter storm is set to hit the region on Wednesday with freezing rain, snow and strong winds, demand was expected.\nSeveral other traders are seeking to deliver cargoes on the west-bound transatlantic route, traders said.\nVienna-based consultancy JBC Energy estimated demand for heating oil in the United States will rise by 90,000 barrels per day in January and February compared to a year earlier.\nTo view a graphic on Pacific Anna, click: reut.rs/2CMFlsk\nAdditional reporting by Jessica Resnick-Ault in New York, editing by David Evans\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "http://reut.rs/2CMFlsk"], "published": "2018-01-03T23:51:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-03T19:27:24.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
