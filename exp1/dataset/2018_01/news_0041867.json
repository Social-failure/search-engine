Hundreds of new coins have been offered for sale to the public. \nRegulators have called the investment mania a dangerous bubble, and said ICOs are “highly speculative” with investors putting their entire capital at risk. \nBackers of cryptocurrencies say the technology underpinning virtual coins has the potential to transform the way we handle money.
