Only action will,” said AAM President Scott Paul, “It’s time for the president’s policies and actions to match his talk.” Reporting by Lesley Wroughton; Editing by Peter Cooney", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-31T07:38:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-31T07:58:25.011+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
