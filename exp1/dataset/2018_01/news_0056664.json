Domestic display makers such as Sharp and Japan Display Inc are struggling to respond to smartphone makers’ shift to organic light-emitting diode (OLED) screens, letting South Korean rivals Samsung Electronics Co Ltd and LG Display Co Ltd take the lead.\nOLED screens are generally thinner, more flexible, and richer in color than liquid-crystal display (LCD) panels, leading Apple to adopt them for its iPhone X.\nSharp will begin mass producing OLED panels, mainly for its own smartphone line-up, between April and June this year. Its chief executive, Tai Jeng-wu, has said he would like to join forces with Japan Display in OLED technology to better compete with South Korean rivals.\nReporting by Minami Funakoshi; Editing by Muralikumar Anantharaman\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-31T08:08:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-31T08:21:28.023+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
