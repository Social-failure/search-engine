That lump-sum payout is $281.[L1N1P106E] \nWith no jackpot winning tickets sold in either game since October, combined the two lottery grand prizes topped $1 billion, the third-largest total in the history of the games. \nThe largest Powerball jackpot was a $1.6-billion payout split among winners in California, Florida and Tennessee in January 2016, according to the North American Association of State and Provincial Lotteries. The largest Mega Millions jackpot of $656 million was won in 2012. \nPowerball tickets are sold in 44 states, and Washington, D.C., Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands.
