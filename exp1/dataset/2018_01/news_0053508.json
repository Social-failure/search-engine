Authorities were investigating whether the attack was part of drug gang conflict. \nJusta told Agencia Brasil that the jail violence was a direct response by the Rio de Janeiro-based Red Command, Brazilâ€™s second-largest drug gang, to the Saturday shootings. \nPolice have made one arrest and named five more suspects in the Saturday shooting.
