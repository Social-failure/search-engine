But I haven't made up my mind,\" on who should succeed Kuroda when his term ends in April, he added. \nMany analysts see a good chance that Kuroda will be reappointed when the government selects successors to him and his two deputies in coming months, decisions that need parliament's approval. \nAbe said Japan's economy was showing signs of emerging from deflation, with a tightening job market pushing up wages. \n\"We'll deploy all available policies so that we can declare an end to deflation at the earliest date possible,\" Abe said. \n\"It might not necessarily be this year, but the government and the BOJ must fulfill their responsibilities,\" he added, so as to ensure conditions to bring about an end to deflation. \nThe government looks at several factors, such as inflation data and the output gap, in determining whether the economy is sustainably out of deflation. \nSome policymakers are keen to declare an end to deflation, which would help Abe argue his policies succeeded in reflating the economy. But doing so could also give the BOJ justification to withdraw crisis-mode stimulus, some analysts say. \nJapan's economy expanded for the seventh straight quarter in July-September, boosted by robust exports and capital expenditure. \nCore consumer inflation rose 0.9 percent in November from a year earlier, marking the 11th straight month of gains but still distant from the BOJ's target of 2 percent. \nAbe has urged companies to raise wages by 3 percent or more this year on the view that wage hikes are critical to boost consumption and sustain Japan's strengthening economic recovery.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-07T13:44:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-07T13:44:05.007+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
