P. Morgan Chase on Jan. 1, 2006, and Lloyd Blankfein took the reins of Goldman Sachs just six months later. Both executives have successfully steered two of the world's most celebrated financial institutions through the most turbulent decade for banking since the 1930s.\nNow that the external environment is finally improving for their sector and their companies' respective share prices have responded accordingly, is it time for these executives to bow out on the perfect high? The median tenure of an S&P 500 CEO is just four years; these two have each been around for 12.\nAnd if they do decide now is the time, who are the leading contenders to replace them?\nIt is hard to decide who handled the 2008 financial crisis better.\nThe fact that Blankfein's Goldman, with a market value of $96 billion, was able to repay the U.S. government's \"bailout' funds in less than 12 months (funds which, to this day, they deny they ever needed) and then turn 2009 into a year of blowout profit relative to the industry raised his profile in the ranks of Goldman's greats.\nHe managed this feat even as the crisis claimed the stand-alone futures of other pure investment banks such as Lehman Brothers (which went bust), Merrill Lynch (which was acquired by Bank Of America) and Bear Stearns (which was acquired by J.P. Morgan).\nMorgan Stanley is the only true survivor alongside Goldman, and it took a change in CEO and major restructuring to try to catch up. Its share price still lags Goldman's from the pre-crisis peak.\nDimon's execution was also outstanding, particularly given that he took on two faltering banks in Bear Stearns and Washington Mutual, increasing J. P. Morgan's already large exposure to the struggling housing market. The bank, which has a market value of $375 billion, emerged within a number of years with a \"fortress balance\" sheet.\nThe subsequent years of extreme regulatory hurdles, significant fines, and politically charged Congressional hearings may also have led to the departures of lesser leaders. But Dimon and Blankfein fought on in a way that Vikram Pandit of Citi, Ken Lewis of Bank Of America and John Mack of Morgan Stanley did not.\nIn the last seven years, Dimon's outperformance is hard to dispute. J. P. Morgan's share price is up 217 percent to Goldman's 67 percent. Both banks are preparing to report fourth quarter and year-end 2017 financial results in the coming days.\nThat said, it is important to highlight how impressive Blankfein's performance is relative to the rest of the pack. Goldman's stock is up 89 percent since he took over. Morgan Stanley is up 31 percent in the same period, while Bank of America and Citi are both down (Citi is still down some 83 percent despite its recent recovery). Indeed Blankfein's starting base was already high given that Goldman was up 130 percent from its 1999 IPO to the time Blankfein became CEO.\nComparing stocks (price moves June 2006 to January 9, 2018)\nBank of America -22.77 percent\nCiti -82.54 percent\nGoldman 88.88 percent\nJ. P. Morgan 232.52 percent\nMorgan Stanley 31.13 percent\nWells Fargo 151.04 percent\nTrading Difficulties The market share of some of Goldman's key businesses is another focus of comparison. From 2010 through the first three quarters of 2017, Goldman's share in stock trading fell to 15 percent from 19 percent, according to Instinet. In fixed income, share fell to 7.5 percent from 12 percent.\nJ.P. Morgan's share, on the other hand, rose to 13 percent from 11 percent in equities, and rose to 19 percent from 14 percent in fixed income.\nIndeed all of the major U.S. investment banks saw gains in share over that period apart from Goldman. The total share in all trading for the big five American investment banks rose to 58.2 percent last year from 47.2 percent in 2010.. That is a major blot on an otherwise impressive copy book for Blankfein.\nGoldman does remain the leading advisory firm, with 12.8 percent market share in banking compared to to J. P. Morgan's second-place 9.2 percent in the most recent quarter. But that is a smaller part of the pie. Trading remains the key for Goldman despite the recent issues. Some 37.5 percent of total revenue in the third quarter of 2017 came from trading compared to 21 percent for investment banking.\nThe only way Blankfein could plausibly face direct pressure from shareholders would be if the company was seen to be missing the recently announced $5 billion revenue growth target set out for the next three years.\nThe very specific forecast, which is rare for Goldman Sachs, came in September 2017 after two dire quarters' of performance. Most analysts agree that the targets are ambitious, and someone will have to take responsibility if they are missed. But that judgement will come in 2019 and 2020.\nDimon's scare Dimon's record since the financial crisis is of course not without its errors. Unquestionably the highest profile was the London Whale scandal in 2012 in which a rogue trader, Bruno Iksil, was able to lose a massive $6.2 billion before Dimon, his lieutenants and the company's risk management systems noticed.\nThe bank ended up paying a fine of $1 billion for violating securities laws, while Dimon was forced to take a pay cut. He maintains that the company itself was never at risk, but the pressure on him was immense at the time, and the firing of some lieutenants brought him to tears on one occasion. He said in an interview last August that Iksil was not the guy to blame.\nRegardless of their troubles, both men have the power to decide when it is time to go. This week, CNBC asked Dimon how many more years he wanted, and he said, \"I love our company and our people and being part of this outstanding team. I won't speculate on timing, and important to note that I serve at the pleasure of the Board.\"\nIt is a board he has shaped over the years and on which he serves as chairman, of course. But he claims that there is no other job in the world he would rather do.\nAt age 63, estimates for Blankfein's departure range from one to three years. For Dimon at 61, the top end is more like five years. The median age of an S&P CEO is 57, according to Equilar.\nBlankfein showed his determination to stay a year ago â€“ when his long-time second in command, Gary Cohn, was offered a job at the White House. Sources say Cohn would have stayed at Goldman had he been promised the CEO role within in two years. Such a promise was not forthcoming from Blankfein.\nWho's next in line? So, while they are both still very much in control, the incentive to bow out for Blankfein a little sooner is higher.\nThe pressure on Dimon internally is also lower. His underlings are more relaxed about the immediate years ahead. At 59, Gordon Smith, CEO of J. P. Morgan's consumer and community bank, is the oldest of Dimon's direct reports. He would also be the most likely candidate to take over if Dimon were to leave tomorrow.\nBut those close to Smith say he does not have a big ego and is not itching to become CEO. Sources say he was consulted for the American Express CEO job late last year but turned it down quickly.\nDaniel Pinto, the 55-year-old head of investment banking, is also content where he is. His performance has been very strong, but he hasn't sought much public praise for it, and thus probably gets less attention than deserved.\nIn another three ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-10T03:06:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-10T03:44:08.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
