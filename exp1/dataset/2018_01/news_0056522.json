The move was aimed to facilitate easier trading with international peers.\nShares of the company were trading 1.8 percent lower at NZ$1.11 at 0120 GMT, while the main index was 0.2 percent higher.\nReporting by Aaron Saldanha in Bengaluru; Editing by Stephen Coates\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-01-31T09:25:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-31T16:32:33.001+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
