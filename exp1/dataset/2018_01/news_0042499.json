These consultants play a valuable role in helping companies find the right balance between controlling benefit costs and recruiting/retaining talent, the latter of which is a top concern with the U.S. unemployment rate at a 17-year low.\n“I’m looking forward to fostering existing relationships as well as creating more connections for ArmadaCare,” adds Mattice. “It’s exciting to bring such unique solutions to the table that help with both healthcare coverage as well as retention and recruitment issues. A lot of national companies are facing significant challenges in these areas, and they need solutions like what ArmadaCare has designed.”\nAbout ArmadaCare\nA pioneer in the supplemental insurance industry, ArmadaCare creates and delivers specialty employee benefits, backed by premier insurance carrier partners.* Strategic benefit consultants recommend ArmadaCare’s innovative insured products to support their product differentiation and to help employers meet the health and benefit needs of various employee constituent groups.
