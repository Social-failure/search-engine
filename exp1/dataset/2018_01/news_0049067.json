WEAKENED SIDE \nDetermined to make up ground, and with a Champions league tie coming up, manager Manuel Pellegrini played a weakened side in the FA Cup fifth-round tie at Chelsea, which City lost 5-1. \nAlthough Guardiola also rotated in City’s fourth-round tie at Cardiff on Sunday, starting Sergio Aguero on the bench, City’s side remained strong with man of the season Kevin De Bruyne directing operations in midfield and Raheem Sterling up front. Aguero was sent on when Leroy Sane was injured. \nPredictably, Guardiola used the German winger’s likely absence over the next few weeks to deflect attention away from quadruple talk. \n“I do not have enough players, I have players out injured. It is impossible,” said the Spaniard, who twice won variations of the treble with Barcelona. \nOnly one British team, Celtic in 1967, have won all four major trophies in one season, but others have gone close. \nLiverpool bagged the League, European Cup and League Cup in 1984 while Manchester United secured an even more illustrious treble of Champions League, Premier League and FA Cup in 1999. \nEight years later Chelsea competed on all four fronts until May 1 when Liverpool knocked them out in the Champions League semi-finals. The Blues went on to win both domestic cups and finished second in the Premier League. \nCity look on course to better that and their former England defender Joleon Lescott is among those who think they can. \n“If anyone can, they can,” he told the BBC. “If they get some luck, they could do it.” \nJust don’t mention it to Guardiola.
