The rest is expected to be reclaimed by June 2019.\nFor the overall project, Sri Lanka anticipates an eventual $13 billion of investment in housing, marinas, health facilities, schools and other developments over the next 30 years. The project is expected to create over 83,000 jobs.\nCHEC Port City Colombo (Pvt) Ltd, the Sri Lanka company handling the project for CCCC, aims to deliver the first site for construction by the end of 2018.\nReporting by Shihar Aneez; editing by Mark Heinrich\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-01-03T00:29:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-03T06:28:27.002+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
