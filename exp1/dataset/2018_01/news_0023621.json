This law covers personal health information, so it suggests that Amazon is looking further than the drug wholesaling business. \nThe job ad mentions “HIPAA Business Associate Agreement” requirements, which points to partnerships with other players, such as health care and health plan providers. \nAccording to the Department of Health and Human Services , a provider covered by the HIPAA rules can only transfer protected health information to a business associate “to help the [provider] carry out its health care functions—not for the business associate’s independent use or purposes, except as needed for the proper management and administration of the business associate.” \nIn other words, if Amazon is the business associate in this scenario, it will face limitations on how it can use the confidential health information that it receives. It will also be obliged to keep that data safe. \nWhat is Amazon actually planning to do? According to CNBC, it might want to bring its Alexa personal assistant technology—which is not yet HIPAA-compliant—into the health care environment. \nFortune has asked Amazon what sort of initiative it’s planning, and will update this article if and when an answer arrives.
