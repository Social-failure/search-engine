He said the company had a long tradition, motivated workforce and an excellent reputation. \n“We want to use this potential in a new business model,” he said. \nTalks with potential clients are under way, but it has not been decided when the airline will relaunch and what name it will use. \nEarlier on Monday the German administrator of insolvent airline Niki said he still wanted to sell the leisure carrier to British Airways parent IAG ( ICAG.L ) despite a battle between Austria and Germany over where insolvency proceedings should be handled. \nMeanwhile Irish airline Ryanair ( RYA.I ) also expressed an interest in buying some of Niki’s assets, and former Formula 1 world champion Niki Lauda has re-emerged as a potential bidder for the business he founded, ahead of a Jan. 19 deadline for fresh offers an Austrian court has set. \nNiki, another unit of collapsed German carrier Air Berlin, filed for insolvency in Berlin in December after Lufthansa [LHAG.DE] scrapped plans to buy part of it.
