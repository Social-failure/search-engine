Barrick Gold rose 0.6 percent to C$17.78. \n* The TSX posted two new 52-week highs and six new lows. Across all Canadian issues there was one new 52-week high and 24 new lows. \n* Among the most active Canadian stocks by volume were Aurora Cannabis, down 7.5 percent at $11.99; Bombardier B, down 4.7 percent at $3.43 and Canopy Growth Co , down 7.2 percent at $30.72. \n* Volume on the TSX index was 50.74 million shares.
