An aide noted that Indonesia was also considering purchasing Lockheed Martin Corp’s F-16 fighter jets, in a deal that could be worth billions. \n“This is a very strategic partnership,” Mattis said, noting Indonesia was the world’s third largest democracy and the most populous Muslim-majority nation. It is also a vast archipelago of over 17,000 islands, with a strategic maritime reach. \n“We’re going to continue our efforts to expand maritime cooperation but also support Indonesia as a sort of fulcrum between the Indian Ocean and the Pacific Ocean,” Mattis told reporters travelling with him. \nIndonesia has clashed with China over fishing rights around the Natuna Islands, detaining Chinese fishermen and expanding its military presence in the area in recent years. \nIn July, Indonesia renamed the northern reaches of its exclusive economic zone in the South China Sea as the North Natuna Sea, a move seen as a significant act of resistance to China’s territorial ambitions in the South China Sea. \nAfter Indonesia, Mattis is expected to travel to Vietnam, which has emerged as the most vocal opponent of China’s expansive territorial claims in the South China Sea, where more than $3 trillion (£2.15 trillion) in cargo passes every year.

REUTERS/Darren Whiteside \n“Every nation matters and there should not be any bullying or shredding of trust towards others,” he said. \nMattis kicked off his trip by meeting Indonesia’s Foreign Minister Retno Marsudi shortly after landing in Jakarta late on Monday. He was expected to meet other senior Indonesian officials on Tuesday. \nJoe Felter, a deputy assistant secretary of defence, noted that the Pentagon had recently singled out China in a strategy document unveiled last week. \n“I think they (the Chinese) have a coherent long-term strategy to exert influence, if not dominate the region,” Felter said. \nFelter said the United States counted $1.5 billion in foreign military sales to Indonesia since 2013, including Apache helicopters. He said Indonesia had recently taken delivery of the first three of eight Apache helicopters. \nThe United States was also expected to explore ways to deepen counter-terrorism cooperation with Indonesia, officials said.
