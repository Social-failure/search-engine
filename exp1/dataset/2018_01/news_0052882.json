Its hires include bankers covering the healthcare, technology, and financial services sectors, it said.\nThe expansion comes after a major restructuring in 2016 - including a big shrinking of its operations in Europe - following its acquisition of Lehman Brothers’ Asian and European businesses in 2008. That led to six consecutive years of losses for its international operations.\nReuters reported last year that Nomura planned to add a dozen senior- and mid-level investment bankers over the next 12 to 18 months in the United States as it anticipated more deals by Japanese firms in the area or by U.S. companies overseas.\nJapanese companies, flush with cash and facing limited growth at home, have sought to acquire firms in the United States. Nomura’s peers are also looking to expand to take advantage of the trend.\nLast year, No.2 brokerage Daiwa Securities Group Inc ( 8601.T ) bought two U.S. boutique merger-and-acquisitions advisory firms to strengthen its M&A operations.\nSumitomo Mitsui Financial Group Inc’s ( 8316.T ) brokerage unit, Japan’s third-largest, is ready to poach bankers to expand its U.S. investment banking arm and could even buy small firms, its chief executive said last month.\nReporting by Thomas Wilson; Editing by Paul Tait\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-30T01:41:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-30T01:59:24.023+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
