By contrast, only 14 percent of Conservative Party members wanted a referendum on the exit deal.\nOpinion polls measuring the views of the wider electorate show similar divisions over Brexit. In December, one survey showed 50 percent of voters supported a second referendum while 34 percent did not.\nLabour’s official stance on Brexit gained new significance after last year’s general election saw them perform better than expected.\nThat helped reopen a national debate about Brexit, depriving May of the unequivocal mandate she was seeking for her plan to take Britain out of the EU, its single market and the bloc’s customs union.\nReporting by William James; editing by Stephen Addison\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-04T02:04:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-04T02:19:06.004+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
