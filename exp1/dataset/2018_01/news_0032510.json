Other investors include Sweden’s Kinnevik ( KINVb.ST ) and Baille Gifford. \nRocket Internet last year listed its two biggest investments, online food sites HelloFresh ( HFGG.DE ) and Delivery Hero ( DHER.DE ). \nHowever, that did little to help Rocket’s own share price, with its current market capitalization of 3.7 billion euros implying the market puts no value on its assets beyond its cash and its stakes in the two listed food firms. \n($1 = 0.8167 euros)", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-18T14:29:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-18T15:15:58.004+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
