That led to investigations by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration and the National Traffic Safety Board.\nThe NHTSA investigation found no defects in the Autopilot system that might have contributed that accident. NTSB investigators said the accident resulted from a combination of factors , including the limitations of the system as well as the actions of both the Tesla driver and the driver of the semitrailer the car crashed into.\nTesla tells drivers in its manual that the system is only meant to be used in certain conditions, and the system itself takes certain measures to prevent misuse. For example, it issues warnings and ultimately shuts off Autopilot if drivers remove their hands from the steering wheel.\nWATCH: Tesla ties Elon Musk's compensation to company performance show chapters Tesla ties Elon Musk's compensation to company performance 7 Hours Ago | 03:01", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-23T17:45:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-23T18:05:54.017+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
