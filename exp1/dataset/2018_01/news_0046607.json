Non-GAAP net income, before taxes, was $1.6 million, or $0.02 per diluted share, excluding special items.\n“Our strong third quarter results demonstrate that we are executing on our strategic initiatives. Mid-market and enterprise bookings grew 40% year-over-year,” said Vik Verma, Chief Executive Officer at 8x8, Inc. “Additionally, we believe CIOs are increasingly demanding integrated enterprise communications solutions for their employees, customers and partners. 49% of new monthly recurring revenue booked from mid-market and enterprise segments came from customers purchasing our integrated UCaaS and CCaaS solutions.

Non-GAAP gross margin was 79%, compared with 79% in the same period last year. GAAP service margin was 83%, compared with 83% in the same period last year. Non-GAAP service margin was 84%, compared with 84% in the same period last year. Cash Flow: Cash generated from operating activities was $8.2 million. Cash, cash equivalents and investments were $161 million at December 31, 2017. New monthly recurring revenue (MRR) booked from mid-market and enterprise customers increased 40% year-over-year and comprised 65% of total bookings in the third fiscal quarter. 49% of new monthly recurring revenue booked from mid-market and enterprise customers purchased 8x8’s integrated UCaaS and CCaaS solutions.

ARPU per business customer grew to $454, compared with $414 in the same period last year. Churn: Gross monthly business service revenue churn on an organic basis of 0.4%, compared with 1.0% in the same period a year ago. Synergy Research Group named 8x8 as the global leader for the eleventh consecutive quarter for subscriber seats in the combined mid-market and enterprise segments of the UCaaS market, which is defined as cloud telephony, conferencing, collaboration and messaging. 8x8 was awarded 6 new communications patents for a total of 150 patents awarded to date. Share Repurchase: Repurchased 298,713 shares of common stock at an average price of $12.81 per share, for a total of $3.8 million, under the Company’s approved share repurchase program.\nFinancial Outlook: For the full fiscal 2018 year, 8x8 has revised its financial outlook:\nRevenue:\nTotal revenue in the range of $293 million to $294 million, representing approximately 16% year-over-year increase, compared with previous guidance of $292 million to $294 million, representing an approximately 15% to 16% year-over-year increase. Service revenue in the $278 million to $279 million range, representing approximately 18% year-over-year increase, up from previous guidance of $275 million to $277 million range, representing an 17% year-over-year increase. Adjusting for the discontinued revenue from the non-core, voice broadcasting segment of DXI, service revenue growth in the range of 19% and total revenue growth in the range of 16% to 17%, compared with previous guidance of service revenue growth in the range of 17% to 18% and total revenue growth in the range of 16% to 17%.\nNon-GAAP Pre-tax Income:\nNon-GAAP pre-tax net income of approximately $9 million or 3% of revenue. Due to the Company’s full valuation allowance against its deferred tax assets, tax expense reflects current taxes in US states and foreign jurisdictions. The estimated non-GAAP effective tax rate is approximately 3% for fiscal year 2018 and excludes the one-time impact of recording the valuation allowance.\nThe Company does not reconcile its forward-looking non-GAAP net income to the corresponding GAAP measures of GAAP net income (loss) due to the significant variability of, and difficulty in making accurate forecasts and projections with regards to, the various expenses we exclude. For example, although future hiring and retention needs may be reasonably predictable, stock-based compensation expense depends on variables that are largely not within the control of nor predictable by management, such as the market price of 8x8 common stock, and may also be significantly impacted by events like acquisitions, the timing and nature of which are difficult to predict with accuracy. Similarly, impairments and other non-recurring items are difficult to predict as they may depend on future events and external factors outside the Company’s control. The actual amounts of these excluded items could have a significant impact on the Company’s GAAP net income (loss). Accordingly, management believes that reconciliations of this forward-looking non-GAAP financial measure to the corresponding GAAP measure is not available without unreasonable effort.\n8x8 also announced that on January 22, 2018, it awarded restricted stock units (RSUs) representing the right to acquire an aggregate of 456,791 shares of the Company’s common stock and non-qualified options to acquire an aggregate of 181,691 shares of common stock to 91 new employees under the 8x8, Inc. 2017 New Employee Inducement Incentive Plan. In addition, a newly hired senior vice president (SVP) received RSUs representing the right to acquire 48,960 shares of common stock and performance share units (PSUs) representing the right to receive, at target, 28,654 shares of common stock. Each stock option is exercisable at a price of $17.35 per share, which was the closing price of a share of the company’s Common Stock on the grant date. Each of the awards is subject to vesting pursuant to the terms of the plan and the recipient’s award agreement, including a requirement that the recipient be employed as of the applicable vesting date. A portion of the RSUs awarded to the newly hired SVP vest in full six months from the recipient’s employment commencement date. Other terms of the awards are substantially the same as those applicable to RSUs, PSUs and options previously granted by the Company to new employees during its current fiscal year.\nThese equity awards were approved unanimously by the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors. Each award was granted as an inducement material to the recipient’s entering into employment with 8x8, in accordance with Section 303a.08 of the New York Stock Exchange listing and governance rules.\nConference Call Information:\nManagement will host a conference call to discuss earnings results on January 25, 2018 at 1:30 p.m. Pacific Time (4:30 p.m. Eastern Time).

Management uses these non-GAAP financial measures internally in analyzing the Company’s financial results and believes they are useful to investors, as a supplement to GAAP measures, in evaluating the Company’s ongoing operational performance. Management believes that the use of these non-GAAP financial measures provides an additional tool for investors to use in evaluating 8x8’s ongoing operating results and trends and in comparing financial results with other companies in the industry, many of which present similar non-GAAP financial measures to investors.\nNon-GAAP financial measures should not be considered in isolation from, or as a substitute for, financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. Investors are encouraged to review the reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measures. This reconciliation has been provided in the financial statement tables included below in this press release.\nIn addition, this release may provide certain financial measures that have been adjusted to exclude the impact of the discontinuation of a non-core, legacy DXI business (based on a voice broadcasting segment), as first reported in the third quarter of the Company’s 2017 fiscal year. To adjust for the discontinued business, revenue figures for each period being compared exclude all revenue attributable to the discontinued business. Some financial measures presented in this release may reflect adjustments for comparison on a constant currency basis when management concluded that the elimination of the impact of currency fluctuations between current and comparative prior periods assist with the evaluation of the underlying business performance.\nManagement has used these adjusted financial measures internally in evaluating the financial performance of the Company’s business and believes they provide investors an additional, useful assessment of the Company’s growth for these periods.\nNon-GAAP Pre-Tax Income, Non-GAAP Net Income and Non-GAAP Net Income Per Share:\nThe Company has defined non-GAAP net income as net income (loss) for GAAP plus amortization of acquired intangible assets, impairment charges, stock-based compensation, other income and expenses, and the provision for or benefit from income taxes. Amortization of acquired intangible assets and impairment charges are excluded because they are a non-cash expense that management does not consider part of ongoing operations when assessing the Company’s financial performance. Stock-based compensation expense has been excluded because it is a non-cash expense and relies on valuations based on future events, such as the market price of 8x8 common stock and attrition, that are difficult to predict and are affected by market factors that are largely not within the control of management. Certain other income and expense items, such as acquisition-related or severance expenses, have been excluded because management considers them to be isolated transactions and believes they are not reflective of the Company’s ongoing operations, reduce comparability of periodic operating results when included, are difficult to predict, and are often one-time. GAAP tax provision (benefit) for income taxes has been excluded as it is also a non-cash expense that management does not consider part of its analysis of the performance of ongoing operations. Due to the Company’s history of tax losses and full valuation allowance against deferred tax assets, future GAAP and Non-GAAP effective tax rates are limited to current taxes in certain US state and foreign jurisdictions. The Company reports these current taxes as reduction from Non-GAAP pretax net income to derive Non-GAAP net income after taxes.\nThe Company defines non-GAAP net income per share as non-GAAP net income divided by the weighted-average diluted shares outstanding which includes the effect of potentially dilutive stock options and awards. The Company defines non-GAAP net income percentage of revenue as non-GAAP net income divided by non-GAAP revenue. Management believes that such exclusions facilitate comparisons to the Company’s historical operating results and to the results of other companies in the same industry, and provides investors with information that management uses in evaluating the Company’s performance on a quarterly and annual basis.\nForward Looking Statements:\nThis news release contains “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.
