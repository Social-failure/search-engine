Scarcity just means that something has a finite supply. In the case of bitcoin, the cryptocurrency has a set cap of 21 million bitcoins.\nMany analysts note that this set cap makes bitcoin more desirable than other assets, even gold. That's because unlike with gold, there's no need to worry about a digital Gold Rush. A treasure trove of bitcoin won't ever be \"discovered,\" causing the crypto's price to crash with an influx in supply.\n\"There are potentially millions of times more gold underground than actually has been extracted,\" said Tom Lee, head of research at Fundstrat Global Advisors. Lee was chief equity strategist at J.P. Morgan before co-founding Fundstrat in 2014.\nBen Yu, a blockchain expert living in San Francisco, says technological advances are also making gold easier to mine.\n\"Today we mine gold at four times the rate that we did just 100 years ago,\" Yu said.\nSo if bitcoin has scarcity, what about its utility?\nChesnot | Getty Images Many believe the cryptocurrency's utility lies in its potential to be a more efficient commodity than we already have. Proponents of bitcoin like it for a number of reasons.\nFirst, bitcoin is decentralized, meaning no government, bank or single person has control over it; it can't be toppled by corruption at the top. It's also trivially divisible, meaning you can buy a small item like a doughnut with it as easily as you can buy a house or even a mansion. And finally, the code it's built on is open source, meaning that it's available for anyone to look at, scrutinize and even modify. This means bitcoin is constantly evolving and improving.\nNone of those uses is intrinsic, however. And that's a point bitcoin skeptics often make. Gold, for example, is thought to have intrinsic value because of its applications in industries like dentistry and electronics. Some people even argue that dollar bills have intrinsic value, since they can be used as kindling or to write on.\nBut as you break down either of those claims, it becomes clear that gold and paper money don't have that much intrinsic value either.\nAccording to the World Gold Council, in 2016, only 15 percent of gold was used in industries. The majority went toward making jewelry and gold bars and coins — items that have value mainly because they're trusted to be valuable.\nWith paper money, the Federal Reserve says it costs about 16 cents to create a $100 bill.\nSo the rest of that hundred bucks — the remaining $99.84 — comes from the trust people place in it.\nIt can be hard to see the digital currency as having value because you can't hold it in your hand like you can a dollar bill or gold.\nAs a solution, Lee said to think of bitcoin as a digital business.\n\"If you ask a baby boomer, 'Can you justify the value of anything that's a digital business?' they probably don't accept that Facebook, Google, Netflix, Amazon, Apple, these are the largest companies in the S&P 500 and they're primarily digital businesses built almost purely on digital trust,\" said Lee.\n\"Anyone who thinks digital gold isn't a store value is overlooking the fact that most businesses today are built around digital trust, including the financial system.\"\nValuing the cryptocurrency It's clear that some people believe bitcoin has value. And if it has value, it's hard not to wonder how much a single bitcoin could end up being worth. \nThere are two main theories being used to calculate the potential value of one bitcoin.\nThe first theorizes that bitcoin, which some perceive to be a better asset than gold, could end up replacing either a portion of gold or gold entirely.\nbodnarchuk | iStock Editorial | Getty Images Bitcoin on a mound of gold. If it were to replace gold entirely, one bitcoin could be worth $357,000. That's calculated by taking the total value of all the gold ever mined in the world, which is about $7.5 trillion, and dividing that number by 21 million — the total bitcoins that can ever exist.\nLee told CNBC it's more realistic to assume bitcoin will replace 5 percent of gold within five years, making a single coin worth $25,000.\nAnother theory of Lee's is based on Metcalfe's law, which says that the value of a network is proportional to the square of the number of users on the network.\nFor example, one phone is useless because you can't call anyone else with it. But the value increases exponentially as other people get phones.\nStudies have shown that Metcalfe's law holds true for Facebook using 10 years of data. It also holds true for Tencent, China's largest social media company.\nFundstrat looked at users on the bitcoin network and found that the square of this value explained 94 percent of the variation in bitcoin prices since 2014.\nMany people think that bitcoin is a bubble, and that's predicted on the concept that bitcoin has no value. But there's reason to believe that that just isn't true.\nBy definition, bitcoin is scarce. And the cryptocurrency may have utility as a superior way to store and exchange wealth.\nWATCH: Bitcoin's creator may be worth $14 billion show chapters Bitcoin’s origin story remains shrouded in mystery.
