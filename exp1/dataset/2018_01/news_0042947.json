In 2017, the Chinese currency strengthened around 6.8 percent, following three years of depreciating against the dollar.\nPrior to market opening, the People’s Bank of China (PBOC) set its official yuan midpoint at the strongest level in more than two years at 6.3916 per dollar.\nIn the spot market, the onshore yuan opened at 6.3983 per dollar and rose to 6.3850 per dollar at one point in morning trade, the strongest since Dec. 4, 2015.\nThe following table shows rates for Asian currencies against the dollar at 0525 GMT.\nCURRENCIES VS U.S. DOLLAR Currency Latest bid Previous day Pct Move\nJapan yen 109.910 110.29 +0.35\nSing dlr 1.315 1.3169 +0.16\nTaiwan dlr 29.260 29.402 +0.49\nKorean won 1069.300 1070.2 +0.08\nBaht 31.704 31.83 +0.40\nPeso 51.010 51.1 +0.18\nRupiah 13323.000 13320 -0.02\nRupee 63.643 63.77 +0.20\nRinggit 3.915 3.925 +0.26\nYuan 6.391 6.4084 +0.28\nChange in 2018\nCurrency Latest bid End 2017 Pct Move\nJapan yen 109.910 112.67 +2.51\nSing dlr 1.315 1.3373 +1.71\nTaiwan dlr 29.260 29.848 +2.01\nKorean won 1069.300 1070.50 +0.11\nBaht 31.704 32.58 +2.76\nPeso 51.010 49.93 -2.12\nRupiah 13323.000 13565 +1.82\nRupee 63.643 63.87 +0.36\nRinggit 3.915 4.0440 +3.30\nYuan 6.391 6.5069 +1.82\nReporting by Christina Martin in Bengaluru; Additional reporting by Aaron Saldanha; Editing by Jacqueline Wong\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-24T08:34:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-24T08:56:29.008+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
