The momentum should continue,” he said.\nEuro zone manufacturers ended 2017 by ramping up activity at the fastest pace in more than two decades, a survey showed on Tuesday, and rising demand suggests they will start the new year on a high.\nTan said Societe Generale forecasts the euro will strengthen to $1.25 by the middle of the year.\nThe dollar’s index against a basket of six major currencies slipped to 91.932, its weakest level since September.\nFor the whole of 2017, the dollar index slid more than 9.8 percent, the greenback’s worst annual performance since 2003.\nSatoshi Okagawa, senior global markets analyst at Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corporation in Singapore, said a drop in the benchmark U.S. 10-year Treasury yield toward the end of 2017 was helping to weigh on the U.S. dollar.\nWith the dollar on the defensive, emerging Asian currencies clawed higher. The Chinese yuan rose to as high as 6.4922 yuan per dollar, its highest level since Sept. 8.\nCommodity currencies traded higher after a rally in metal and oil prices and the Australian dollar gained another 0.4 percent to reach $0.7836, its highest level since October.\nBitcoin, the biggest and best-known digital currency, was flat at $13,496 after earlier falling 2.0 percent on the Luxembourg-based Bitstamp exchange.\nBitcoin soared in 2017, gaining more than 1,300 percent for the year, although it fell at the end of December from its peak.\nFor Reuters Live Markets blog on European and UK stock markets see reuters://realtime/verb=Open/url=http://emea1.apps.cp.extranet.thomsonreuters.biz/cms/?pageId=livemarkets (Additional reporting by Masayuki Kitano in SINGAPORE; Editing by Matthew Mpoke Bigg)\n ", "external_links": ["http://emea1.apps.cp.extranet.thomsonreuters.biz/cms/?pageId=livemarkets", "http://tmsnrt.rs/2egbfVh", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-01-02T17:14:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-02T18:24:36.022+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
