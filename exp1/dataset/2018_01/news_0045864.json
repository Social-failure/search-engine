(NASDAQ: MXIM) reported net revenue of $623 million for its second quarter of fiscal 2018 ended December 30, 2017, an 8% increase from the $576 million revenue recorded in the prior quarter, and a 13% increase from the same quarter of last year.\nTunc Doluca, President and Chief Executive Officer, commented, \"We are pleased with our performance in the December quarter. Compared to the same quarter last year, revenue growth was led by double-digit increases in Industrial and Automotive with continued solid company profitability.\" Mr. Doluca continued, \"Looking forward, we expect another strong revenue quarter in our March quarter with significant growth in Automotive, Industrial and Consumer compared to the same quarter last year. Our profitability and revenue growth are enabling exceptionally strong earnings performance and cash flow, giving us confidence to increase our return of capital to shareholders.\"\nFiscal Year 2018 Second Quarter Results\nBased on Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP), loss per share in the December quarter was $0.27. The results were affected by pre-tax special items which primarily consisted of $12 million in charges related to acquisitions and $6 million in charges related to restructuring activities as well as tax special items consisting of $244 million in charges due to corporate tax reform. GAAP earnings per share, excluding special items was $0.65. An analysis of GAAP versus GAAP excluding special items is provided in the last table of this press release.\nCash Flow Items\nAt the end of the second quarter of fiscal 2018, total cash, cash equivalents and short term investments were $2.82 billion, an increase of $49 million from the prior quarter.\nNotable items included:\nCash flow from operations: $230 million Capital expenditures: $22 million Dividends paid: $101 million ($0.36 per share) Stock repurchases: $77 million\nTrailing twelve months free cash flow was $849 million. Free cash flow is a non-GAAP measure and is defined by net cash flow from operations less gross capital expenditures.\nBusiness Outlook\nThe Company's 90-day backlog at the beginning of the March 2018 quarter was $446 million. Based on the beginning backlog and expected turns, our results for the March 2018 quarter are forecasted to be as follows:\nRevenue: $620 to $660 million Gross Margin: 64% to 66% GAAP (66% to 68% excluding special items) EPS: $0.63 to $0.69 GAAP ($0.66 to $0.72 excluding special items)\nMaxim Integrated's business outlook does not include the potential impact of any special items related to restructuring activity, acquisitions, or other business combinations that may be completed during the quarter.\nDividend\nOur Board of Directors approved a 17% increase in the quarterly dividend. A cash dividend of $0.42 per share will be paid on March 15, 2018, to stockholders of record on March 1, 2018.\nConference Call\nMaxim Integrated has scheduled a conference call on January 25 at 2:00 p.m. Pacific Time to discuss its financial results for the second quarter of fiscal 2018 and its business outlook.

per share due to net income on a non-GAAP basis.\nNon-GAAP Measures\nTo supplement the consolidated financial results prepared under GAAP, Maxim Integrated uses non-GAAP measures which are adjusted from the most directly comparable GAAP results to exclude special items related to intangible asset amortization; accelerated depreciation; impairment of long-lived assets; severance and restructuring; other operating expenses (income), net; interest and other expense (income), net; and other income tax effects and adjustments. We defined free cash flow as net cash provided from operations less gross capital expenditures. Management uses these non-GAAP measures internally to make strategic decisions, forecast future results and evaluate Maxim Integrated's current performance. Many analysts covering Maxim Integrated use the non-GAAP measures as well. Given management's use of these non-GAAP measures, Maxim Integrated believes these measures are important to investors in understanding Maxim Integrated's current and future operating results as seen through the eyes of management. In addition, management believes these non-GAAP measures are useful to investors in enabling them to better assess changes in Maxim Integrated's core business across different time periods. These non-GAAP measures are not in accordance with or an alternative to GAAP financial data and may be different from non-GAAP measures used by other companies. Because non-GAAP financial measures are not standardized it may not be possible to compare these financial measures with other companies' non-GAAP financial measures, even if they have similar names. The non-GAAP measures displayed in the table above include the following:\nGAAP Gross Profit Excluding Special Items\nThe use of GAAP gross profit excluding special items allows management to evaluate the gross margin of the Company's core businesses and trends across different reporting periods on a consistent basis, independent of special items including intangible asset amortization, accelerated depreciation, and other costs of goods sold. In addition, it is an important component of management's internal performance measurement and reward process as it is used to assess the current and historical financial results of the business, for strategic decision making, preparing budgets and forecasting future results. Management presents GAAP gross profit excluding special items to enable investors and analysts to evaluate our revenue generation performance relative to the direct costs of revenue of Maxim Integrated's core businesses.\nGAAP Operating Expenses Excluding Special Items\nThe use of GAAP operating expenses excluding special items allows management to evaluate the operating expenses of the Company's core businesses and trends across different reporting periods on a consistent basis, independent of special items including intangible asset amortization; impairment of long-lived assets; severance and restructuring, and other operating expenses (income), net. In addition, it is an important component of management's internal performance measurement and reward process as it is used to assess the current and historical financial results of the business, for strategic decision making, preparing budgets and forecasting future results. Management presents GAAP operating expenses excluding special items to enable investors and analysts to evaluate our core business and its direct operating expenses.\nGAAP Provision for Income Taxes Excluding Special Items\nThe use of a GAAP provision for income taxes excluding special items allows management to evaluate the provision for income taxes across different reporting periods on a consistent basis, independent of special items including the tax provision impact of pre-tax special items. In fiscal year 2016, we began using a long-term tax rate to compute the GAAP provision for income taxes excluding special items. This long-term tax rate considers the income tax impact of pre-tax special items and eliminates the effects of significant non-recurring and period specific tax items which vary in size and frequency, including certain one time tax charges resulting from the U.S. tax legislation that was enacted on December 22, 2017. In the first quarter of fiscal year 2018, we began using a long-term tax rate of 14%, which was our forecast of the weighted average of our normalized fiscal year GAAP tax rate excluding special items over a four-year period, that includes the past three fiscal years plus the current fiscal year projection at the beginning of fiscal year 2018. We review the long-term tax rate on an annual basis and more frequently whenever events occur that may materially affect the long-term tax rate such as tax law changes; significant changes in our geographic earnings mix; or changes in our corporate structure. We are currently in the process of reevaluating our long-term rate in light of the U.S. tax legislation that was enacted on December 22, 2017.\nGAAP Net Income and GAAP Net Income per Share Excluding Special Items\nThe use of GAAP net income and GAAP net income per share excluding special items allow management to evaluate the operating results of Maxim Integrated's core businesses and trends across different reporting periods on a consistent basis, independent of special items including intangible asset amortization; accelerated depreciation; impairment of long-lived assets; severance and restructuring; other operating expenses (income), net; interest and other expense (income), net; and other income tax effects and adjustments. In addition, they are important components of management's internal performance measurement and reward process as it is used to assess the current and historical financial results of the business, for strategic decision making, preparing budgets and forecasting future results. Management presents GAAP net income and GAAP net income per share excluding special items to enable investors and analysts to understand the results of operations of Maxim Integrated's core businesses and to compare our results of operations on a more consistent basis against that of other companies in our industry.\n\"Safe Harbor\" Statement\nThis press release contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.
