Firstly, they make higher revenues in terms of their returns,” John Moore, trader at Berkeley Capital, said. \n“We think UK banks could do quite well despite the uncertainty, purely because we see them as undervalued.” \nShares in Royal Bank of Scotland led the banking sector, up 3.4 percent after broker Morgan Stanley upgraded its rating on the stock to “overweight”. \nMorgan Stanley said that RBS offered the most resilience in an uncertain outlook. \nShares in peers HSBC and Standard Chartered also gained more than 2 percent. \nWednesday was another day dominated by Christmas updates from retailers, with shares in grocer Sainsbury’s advancing 1.5 percent after it beat forecasts slightly in its Christmas trading update. \n“Sainsbury’s has delivered reassuring trading through what, post the Argos acquisition, is its key quarter for sales and profitability,” analysts at UBS said in a note. \nThis continues a positive theme for food retailers over the festive period as shoppers resisted cutting back on food purchases despite inflationary pressures on the consumer. \nPeer Morrisons saw its shares rise in the previous session after its own update. \nElsewhere a well-received Christmas update sent shares in Ted Baker 8.2 percent to the top of the mid cap index. \nHousebuilder Taylor Wimpey found itself at the bottom of the FTSE 100, however, down 3.6 percent on the back of a trading statement. \nThe housebuilder said that it saw its full-year results for 2017 to be in line with expectations. \nElsewhere a warning from the UK’s Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) put pressure on shares in spreadbetters, with IG Group dropping more than 4 percent, Plus500 down 4 percent and CMC Markets down 5 percent. \nThe FCA said that there are “areas of serious concern” in Britain’s contracts for differences (CFDs) market, following a review.
