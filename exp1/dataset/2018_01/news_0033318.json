It would be the opposite of fair,” Dulger told WirtschaftsWoche.\nThree rounds of regional talks have failed to reach agreement.\nA fourth round begins in the southwestern state of Baden-Wuerttemberg, home to Mercedes-Benz maker Daimler and sports car brand Porsche, on Jan. 24.\nAny deal in Baden-Wuerttemberg would typically be applied in other states as well.\nIf the two sides remain at loggerheads, IG Metall’s leadership may decide at a meeting on Jan. 26 to call for 24-hour walkouts or ballot the union’s members on strike action.\nMore than half a million workers at hundreds of metals and engineering companies have taken part in industrial action this month to support IG Metall’s demands.
