The federal state of Berlin declined to comment. \nAmazon said that retailers using the U.S. group’s platform as a marketplace are independent enterprises and are responsible for their own tax obligations. \nA German taxpayers’ union said in November that Germany could be losing out on 1 billion euros ($1.2 billion) annually because online retailers from China, or other non-EU states, fail to pay value added taxes of 19 percent, knowingly or not. \nBritain in November said it would introduce measures to hold online marketplaces like eBay ( EBAY.O ) and Amazon.com accountable when sellers on their platforms do not collect and pay VAT.
