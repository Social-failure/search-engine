Prime Minister Viktor Orban’s ruling Fidesz party holds a comfortable lead over the main opposition according to the latest polls.\nFor GRAPHIC on emerging market FX performance 2017, see tmsnrt.rs/2e7eoml For GRAPHIC on MSCI emerging index performance 2017, see tmsnrt.rs/2dZbdP5\nFor CENTRAL EUROPE market report, see\nFor TURKISH market report, see\nFor RUSSIAN market report, see) Emerging Markets Prices from Reuters Equities Latest Net Chg % Chg % Chg\non year\nMorgan Stanley Emrg Mkt Indx 1194.90 -2.63 -0.22 +3.15\nCzech Rep 1102.55 +0.82 +0.07 +2.26\nPoland 2511.52 +0.25 +0.01 +2.04\nHungary 39608.15 -43.08 -0.11 +0.59\nRomania 8091.05 +56.20 +0.70 +4.35\nGreece 835.37 -0.91 -0.11 +4.11\nRussia 1237.30 +2.66 +0.22 +7.18\nSouth Africa 52757.84 -410.12 -0.77 +0.43\nTurkey 13196.54 -392.91 -0.35 -1.85\nChina 3425.57 +3.74 +0.11 +3.58\nIndia 34499.84 +66.77 +0.19 +1.30\nCurrencies Latest Prev Local Local\nclose currency currency\n% change % change\nin 2018\nCzech Rep 25.53 25.55 +0.08 -0.02\nPoland 4.17 4.17 -0.01 +0.02\nHungary 308.86 309.19 +0.11 +0.54\nRomania 4.63 4.64 +0.05 +0.91\nSerbia 118.64 118.70 +0.05 -0.20\nRussia 56.99 57.04 +0.09 +1.17\nKazakhstan 330.06 330.37 +0.09 +0.83\nUkraine 28.46 28.34 -0.43 -1.11\nSouth Africa 12.46 12.43 -0.24 -0.82\nKenya 103.05 103.00 -0.05 +0.05\nIsrael 3.42 3.43 +0.07 +1.60\nTurkey 3.80 3.80 -0.06 -0.26\nChina 6.51 6.51 -0.02 -0.01\nIndia 63.66 63.62 -0.06 +0.27\nBrazil 3.23 3.23 +0.00 +2.61\nMexico 19.31 19.29 -0.14 +1.73\nDebt Index Strip Spd Chg %Rtn Index\nSov‘gn Debt EMBIG 300 0 .14 8 07.38 1\nAll data taken from Reuters at 09:57 GMT.
