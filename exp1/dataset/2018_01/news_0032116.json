We would like the U.S. to deal with this,” Japan’s Minister of Defence Itsunori Onodera said. \nHis ministry had clear evidence of Thursday’s overflight, including radar data and video, which it had given to the Marines and released to the media, Onodera said. \nThe Marines insisted that their helicopters had avoided the school. \n“Pilots from yesterday’s flights were aware of the school’s location and avoided it, and Marine Corps Air Station Futenma confirmed using radar tracking data and pilot interviews that no Marine Corps aircraft flew over the school yesterday,” they said in a statement. \nTeachers and students at the elementary school conducted drills yesterday to evacuate the playground in case of falling aircraft parts. \nLocated strategically at the edge of the East China Sea, Okinawa hosts some 30,000 military personnel living and working on bases that cover a fifth of the island. Okinawa was under U.S. occupation until 1972.
