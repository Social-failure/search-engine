That’s triple the 2017 total, which itself was a record, according to Thomson Reuters data. \nAphria shares were down 4.5 percent at C$19.30 on Monday, after having jumped almost three-fold in the past three months. Nuuvera shares jumped 12.1 percent to C$7.81 in morning trading. \nThe anticipation of a surge in demand, both at home and overseas, has fueled a deal-making, capital-raising frenzy in the industry and propelled stocks to fresh peaks. \nWhile that has prompted fears of a bubble and calls for corrections from analysts, the sector has so far continued on its upward path. \n($1 = 1.2335 Canadian dollars) Reporting by Nichola Saminather in Toronto and Anirban Paul in Bengaluru; Editing by Martina D'Couto and Bernadette Baum", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-01-29T20:36:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-29T15:05:30.059+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
