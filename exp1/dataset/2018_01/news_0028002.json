That is an oppressive drag on incomes for households, who also happen to hold a record amount of debt.\nThe weakness in wages has in turn contributed to a long stretch of uncomfortably low inflation.\nCore measures favored by the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) have been running below the floor of its 2-3 percent target band for much of the last two years, the chief reason it has had to keep interest rates at a record low of 1.5 percent.\nAnalysts polled also see only a very gradual pick up in price pressures ahead.\nConsumer price inflation is forecast to average 2.2 percent this year and 2.3 percent next, though at least that means the RBA should be able to keep policy loose for as long as proves necessary.\n(For other stories from the Reuters global economic poll)\n($1 = 1.2502 Australian dollars)\nReporting by Wayne Cole; Editing by Sam Holmes\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-01-19T11:09:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-19T12:27:19.015+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
