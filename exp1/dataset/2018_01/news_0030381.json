Analysts were looking for $4.91 cents per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S estimate. \nRevenue from investment banking - which includes fees from IPOs, underwriting and M&A advisory - rose 44.1 percent to $2.14 billion. \nFrom trading bonds, currencies and securities (FICC), the company earned $1 billion, down 50 percent from last year. \nGoldman has been actively shifting towards lesser market-sensitive divisions, such as investment management and consumer lending, to stave off some of the volatility from its bond and equity trading division - a unit that has seen the most headwinds over the last couple of quarters. \nRevenue, including net interest income, fell 4.1 percent to $7.83 billion, but beat average estimates of $7.61 billion. \nTotal operating expenses fell 1 percent to $4.73 billion.
