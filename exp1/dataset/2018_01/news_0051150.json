But the Christian Social Union (CSU) - the Bavarian sister party of Merkel’s conservatives - was especially concerned that higher prices for heating oil could harm their chances in Bavaria’s regional election this year, the sources said.\nOtherwise, they said negotiations in the working group that focuses on the environment and energy had been constructive. The group supported an extra paragraph on energy efficiency to be added to the coalition blueprint, which would also ensure that building renovations were tax-deductible.\nAdditional reporting by Paul Carrel and Joseph Nasr; Writing by Michelle Martin; Editing by Mark Heinrich\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-29T15:52:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-29T16:09:04.023+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
