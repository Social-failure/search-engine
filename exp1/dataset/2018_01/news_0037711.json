It was the highest annual total since the government began counting murders in 1997.\nMexico has struggled with years of violence as the government has battled vicious drug cartels that have increasingly splintered into smaller, more bloodthirsty, gangs.\nViolence is a central issue in July’s presidential election. Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto faces an uphill battle to keep his ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party in office.\nThere were 40 percent more murder investigations opened last year compared with 2013, Pena Nieto’s first full year in office.\nMexico on Thursday dismissed a claim by U.S. President Donald Trump that it was the most dangerous country in the world.\nReporting by Gabriel Stargardter; Editing by Daniel Wallis\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-21T20:42:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-21T20:59:45.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
