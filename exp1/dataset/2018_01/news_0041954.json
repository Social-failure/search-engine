But she is likely to struggle to convince some Security Council members, like veto powers Russia and China, that U.N. action is needed.\nMost sanctions on Iran were lifted at the start of 2016 under the nuclear deal, which is enshrined in a U.N. Security Council resolution. The resolution still subjects Tehran to a U.N. arms embargo and other restrictions that are technically not part of the nuclear deal.\nHaley has said the Security Council could strengthen the provisions in that resolution or adopt a new resolution banning Iran from all activities related to ballistic missiles. To pass, a resolution needs nine votes in favor, and no vetoes by the United States, Britain, France, China or Russia.\nUnder the current resolution, Iran is “called upon” to refrain from work on ballistic missiles designed to deliver nuclear weapons for up to eight years. Some states argue that the language of the resolution does not make it obligatory.\nA separate U.N. resolution on Yemen bans the supply of weapons to Houthi leaders and “those acting on their behalf or at their direction.”\nThe United States could propose people or entities to be blacklisted by the council’s Yemen sanctions committee, a closed-door move that would need consensus approval by the 15-members.\nDiplomats, speaking on condition of anonymity, say Haley has not signaled which accountability option she might pursue or when.\nReporting by Michelle Nichols; Editing by Mary Milliken and James Dalgleish\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-26T22:11:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-26T22:19:35.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
