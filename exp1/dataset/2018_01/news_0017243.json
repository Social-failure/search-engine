Freshman Alex O‘Connell scored 12 of his 13 points in the first half.\nBagley, who shot 11-for-21 from the field, has a double-double in 14 of 17 games this season.\nDuke shot 12-for-23 from 3-point range. The Blue Devils rolled despite senior guard Grayson Allen being limited to two points, though he had a career-high 12 rebounds.\nBryant Crawford’s 21 points, Keyshawn Woods’ 15 points and Brandon Childress’ 11 points paced Wake Forest (8-9, 1-4), which has lost 18 consecutive visits to Cameron Indoor Stadium.\nAbout 40 minutes before tip-off, the school announced that Krzyzewski would miss the game due to a virus.\nAssociated head coach Jeff Capel filled in. Capel had an extended stint in this role last January following the Hall of Fame coach’s back surgery.\nDuke, which has won a pair of blowouts since last Saturday’s loss at North Carolina State, led by as many as 16 points before holding a 46-33 edge at halftime, aided by a 14-3 gap in made free throws.\nIn the first nine minutes, Wake Forest centers Doral Moore and Olivier Sarr both picked up two fouls. By the end, the Demon Deacons were called for 26 fouls.\nDuke finished 27-for-34 on free throws compared to Wake Forest’s 7-for-9.\nDuke used a 9-0 run for a 20-15 lead. With seven straight points from O‘Connell, the Blue Devils went up 41-28 with 2:42 left in the half.\nDuke’s next game is Monday night at Miami, so it’s a quick turnaround and unclear if Krzyzewski will be on that trip.\nThis is the third season in a row that Krzyzewski has missed at least one game. He skipped a February 2016 trip to Georgia Tech because of illness.\n--Field Level Media\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-01-14T03:31:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-14T20:25:01.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
