(NASDAQ:HTBI) (\"Company\"), the holding company of HomeTrust Bank (\"Bank\"), today announced a preliminary net loss of $10.7 million for the quarter ended December 31, 2017, driven by an estimated $17.7 million deferred tax revaluation resulting from enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the \"Tax Act”), compared to net income of $3.0 million for the same period a year ago. The Company's diluted loss per share was $0.59 for the three months ended December 31, 2017 compared to earnings per share of $0.17 for the same period in fiscal 2017. Loss on assets was 1.31% for the three months ended December 31, 2017 compared to a return on assets of 0.43% for the same period in fiscal 2017. Net loss totaled $5.1 million for the six months ended December 31, 2017, compared to net income of $6.8 million for the same period in fiscal 2017. Diluted loss per share was $0.28 for the six months ended December 31, 2017 compared to earnings per share of $0.39 for the same period last year. Loss on assets was 0.32% for the six months ended December 31, 2017 compared to a return on assets of 0.49% for the same period in fiscal 2017. The Tax Act, which among other things, reduced the federal corporate tax rate to 21% effective January 1, 2018 requiring the Company to revalue net deferred tax assets. The resulting estimated $17.7 million deferred tax revaluation was reflected as an increase to the Company's income tax expense.\nFor the quarter ended December 31, 2017 compared to the corresponding quarter in the previous year and before the change in the federal tax rate and prior year merger-related expenses:\nnet income increased 134.2% to $7.0 million from $3.0 million;\ndiluted earnings per share increased 123.5% to $0.38 from $0.17; and\nreturn on assets increased 100.0% to 0.86% from 0.43%.\nFor the six months ended December 31, 2017 compared to the same period a year ago and before the change in the federal tax rate, merger-related expenses, certain state income tax expenses, and gains from the sale of premises and equipment:\nnet income increased 72.9% to $12.6 million from $7.3 million;\ndiluted earnings per share increased 58.1% to $0.68 from $0.43; and\nreturn on assets increased 47.2% to 0.78% from 0.53%.\n\"The cumulative impact of our team's work over the past five years continues to position HomeTrust to make fiscal 2018 an inflection point for our financial performance as evidenced by our core results for the quarter end and year-to-date December 2017,” said Dana Stonestreet, Chairman, President, and CEO. \"The increase in core earnings continues to reflect the execution of our strategic plan, organic loan growth, and our successful integration of TriSummit Bank (\"TriSummit\") during 2017. While strategic acquisitions have played a key role in expanding our markets, our continued growth is not dependent on mergers and acquisition activity - we are focused on leveraging our new teams of revenue producers in our expanded footprint to continue our solid growth. In the past twelve months, we have hired 22 revenue producers and expect to add another 15 in the year ahead. I could not be more proud of the HomeTrust team that continues to capitalize on the momentum in our new growing urban markets that is transforming HomeTrust from a rural mutual savings bank to a regional commercial bank.”\nIncome Statement Review\nNet interest income was $25.2 million for the quarter ended December 31, 2017 compared to $20.4 million for the comparative quarter in fiscal 2017. The $4.8 million, or 23.6% increase was primarily due to a $6.8 million increase in interest and dividend income driven by an increase in average interest-earning assets. Average interest-earning assets increased $452.9 million, or 18.0% to $3.0 billion for the quarter ended December 31, 2017 compared to $2.5 billion for the corresponding quarter in fiscal 2017. The average balance of loans receivable for the quarter ended December 31, 2017 increased $495.9 million, or 26.0% due to the TriSummit acquisition and organic net loan growth, which was mainly funded by the cumulative decrease of $43.0 million, or 7.0% in average interest-earning deposits with banks, securities available for sale, and other interest-earning assets, an increase in average deposits of $307.9 million, or 17.2%, and an increase in average Federal Home Loan Bank (\"FHLB\") borrowings of $130.7 million, or 23.9% as compared to the same quarter last year. Net interest margin (on a fully taxable-equivalent basis) for the three months ended December 31, 2017 increased to 3.44% from 3.33% for the same period a year ago. We continue to utilize our leveraging strategy, where designated short-term FHLB borrowings are invested in various short-term liquid assets to generate additional net interest income, as well as the required purchase of additional FHLB stock which generates increased dividend income. During the three months ended December 31, 2017 our leveraging strategy produced an additional $1.1 million in interest and dividend income at an average yield of 1.66%, while the average cost of the borrowings was 1.23%, resulting in approximately $274,000 in net interest income. During the same quarter in the prior fiscal year, our leveraging strategy produced an additional $908,000 in interest and dividend income at an average yield of 1.07%, while the average cost of the borrowings was 0.44%, resulting in approximately $530,000 in net interest income. Excluding the effects of the leveraging strategy, the tax equivalent net interest margin would be 3.73% and 3.75% for the quarters ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.\nTotal interest and dividend income increased $6.8 million, or 30.8% for the three months ended December 31, 2017 as compared to the same period last year, which was primarily driven by a $6.3 million, or 31.6% increase in loan interest income, a $364,000, or 38.8% increase in certificates of deposit and other interest-bearing deposits, and a $110,000, or 28.1% increase in other investment income. The additional loan interest income was primarily due to the increase in the average balance of loans receivable as well as an increase in the average loan yields due to increases in the federal funds rate over the past 12 months. Average loan yields increased 13 basis points to 4.41% for the quarter ended December 31, 2017 from 4.28% in the corresponding quarter from last year. In addition, there was a $146,000, or 18.9% increase in the accretion of purchase discounts on acquired loans to $920,000 for the quarter ended December 31, 2017 from $774,000 for the same quarter in fiscal 2017 as a result of prepayments. For the quarters ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, the average loan yields included 15 and 16 basis points, respectively, from the accretion of purchase discounts on acquired loans.\nTotal interest expense increased $2.0 million, or 119.5% for the quarter ended December 31, 2017 compared to the same period last year. This increase was primarily related to the TriSummit acquisition and recent deposit gathering initiatives contributing to a $250.9 million, or 16.3% increase in the average balance of interest-bearing deposits. In addition, average borrowings, consisting primarily of short-term FHLB advances, increased by $130.7 million to $677.0 million due to funding for loan growth along with a 78 basis point increase in the average cost of such borrowings during the quarter as compared to the same quarter last year. The overall average cost of funds increased 27 basis points to 0.58% for the current quarter as compared to the same quarter last year due primarily to the impact of the recent increases in the federal funds rate on our borrowings.\nNet interest income increased $8.3 million or 19.9% to $49.8 million for the six months ended December 31, 2017 compared to $41.6 million for the six months ended December 31, 2016. Average interest-earning assets increased $422.2 million, or 16.7% to $2.9 billion for the six months ended December 31, 2017 compared to $2.5 billion in the same period in 2016. The $504.7 million, or 26.9% increase in average balance of loans receivable for the six months ended December 31, 2017 was due to the TriSummit acquisition and increased organic loan growth, which was mainly funded by the cumulative decrease of $82.4 million, or 12.8% in average interest-earning deposits with banks, securities available for sale, and other interest-earning assets and an increase in average deposits of 282.0 million, or 15.7% and an increase in average FHLB borrowings of $132.4 million, or 24.5%. Net interest margin (on a fully taxable-equivalent basis) for the six months ended December 31, 2017 increased five basis points to 3.43% from 3.38% for last year. For the six months ended December 31, 2017, our leveraging strategy produced an additional $2.0 million in interest and dividend income at an average yield of 1.62%, while the average cost of the borrowings was 1.20%, resulting in approximately $519,000 in net interest income. Our leveraging strategy produced an additional $1.9 million in interest and dividend income at an average yield of 1.04% during the corresponding period in fiscal 2017, while the average cost of the borrowings was 0.43%, resulting in approximately $1.1 million in net interest income. Excluding the effects of the leveraging strategy, the tax equivalent net interest margin would be 3.71% and 3.86% for the six months ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.\nTotal interest income increased $11.9 million, or 26.5% for the six months ended December 31, 2017 as compared to the same period last year. The increase was primarily driven by an $11.0 million, or 27.4% increase in loan interest income, a $490,000, or 24.7% increase in certificates of deposit and other interest-bearing deposits, and a $229,000, or 29.4% increase in other investment income. The additional loan interest income was primarily due to the increase in the average balance of loans receivable, which was partially offset by a $908,000 decrease in the accretion of purchase discounts on acquired loans to $1.7 million for the six months ended December 31, 2017 from $2.6 million for the same period in fiscal 2017, as a result of full repayments of several loans with large discounts in the previous year. Overall, average loan yields decreased four basis points to 4.38% for the six months ended December 31, 2017 from 4.42% in fiscal 2017. Excluding the effects of the accretion on purchase discounts on acquired loans, loan yields increased nine basis points to 4.23% for the six months ended December 31, 2017 compared to 4.14% in the same period last year.\nTotal interest expense increased $3.6 million, or 110.0% for the six months ended December 31, 2017 compared to the same period last year. This increase was primarily related to the increase in average borrowings and the corresponding 77 basis point increase in the average cost of those borrowings, resulting in additional interest expense of $2.9 million for the six months ended December 31, 2017 as compared to the same period in the prior year. The overall increase in average interest-bearing deposits and the seven basis point increase in cost of funds resulted in an additional $747,000 in interest expense for the six months ended December 31, 2017 compared to the corresponding period last year.\nNoninterest income increased $846,000, or 21.5% to $4.8 million for the three months ended December 31, 2017 from $3.9 million for the same period in the previous year. The leading factors of the increase included a $299,000, or 15.9% increase in service charges on deposit accounts as a result of the increase in deposit accounts as well as a $424,000, or 45.3% increase in loan income from the gain on sale of mortgage loans and various commercial loan-related fees driven by the new SBA loan line of business.\nNoninterest income increased $1.2 million, or 14.4% to $9.4 million for the six months ended December 31, 2017 from $8.2 million for the same period, primarily due to a $424,000, or 11.2% increase in service charges on deposit accounts; a $549,000, or 28.7% increase in loan income from the gain on sale of mortgage loans and various commercial loan-related fees; and $414,000, or 40.6% increase in other income. Partially offsetting these increases was a $221,000, or 57.4% decrease in gains from the sale of fixed assets for the six months ended December 31, 2017 compared to the same period last year.\nNoninterest expense for the three months ended December 31, 2017 increased $695,000, or 3.4% to $21.2 million compared to $20.5 million for the three months ended December 31, 2016. The TriSummit acquisition led to additional noninterest expenses as shown in the cumulative increase of $973,000, or 17.4% in net occupancy expense; telephone, postage,and supplies; core deposit intangible amortization; and other expenses. Deposit insurance premiums increased $216,000, or 106.4% as the net asset base has increased. These increases in noninterest expense were partially offset by the absence of $27,000 in merger-related expenses, a $140,000, or 30.5% decrease in marketing and advertising expense, and a $408,000, or 56.9% decrease in real estate owned (\"REO\") related expenses for the quarter ended December 31, 2017 compared to the same period last year. For the three months ended December 31, 2017, there was a $235,000 decrease on writedowns and losses from REO sales compared to the corresponding quarter last year; and a $173,000 decrease in REO expenses as a result of fewer REO properties held.\nNoninterest expense for the six months ended December 31, 2017 increased $2.6 million, or 6.7% to $42.3 million compared to $39.6 million for the six months ended December 31, 2016. Salaries and employee benefits increased $1.8 million, or 8.0% primarily as a result of the TriSummit acquisition. The TriSummit acquisition was the leading factor in the $1.5 million, or 13.0% cumulative increase in net occupancy expense; telephone, postage,and supplies; core deposit intangible amortization; and other expenses. Partially offsetting these increases was the absence of $334,000 in merger-related expenses, and a $587,000, or 59.2% decrease in REO related expenses for the six months ended December 31, 2017 compared to the same period last year, which was driven by a $42,000 gain on the sale of REO compared to a $469,000 loss on the sale of REO in the corresponding period in the prior year.\nFor the three months ended December 31, 2017, the Company's income tax expense was $19.5 million compared to $893,000 for the three months ended December 31, 2016, which was a direct result of the Tax Act. As previously mentioned, the reduction in the corporate tax rate required the Company to revalue net deferred tax assets, resulting in a $17.7 million adjustment through income tax expense. In addition, our June 30 fiscal year end required the use of a blended rate as prescribed by the Internal Revenue Code. The blended federal rate of 27.5% was effective retroactively to July 1, 2017 and will be used for the entire fiscal year ended June 30, 2018. As a result of this blended rate, income tax expense for the quarter ended December 31, 2017 includes approximately $418,000 in tax benefit from adjusting the federal income tax rate to 27.5% from 34% for the first quarter of the fiscal year. Excluding the effect of the revaluation of net deferred tax assets, the additional income tax expense was due to higher taxable income.\nFor the six months ended December 31, 2017, the Company's income tax expense was $22.0 million compared to $3.3 million for the corresponding period last year as a result of the deferred tax revaluation and to a lesser extent, higher taxable income. In addition, for the six months ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, the Company incurred a charge of $133,000 and $490,000, respectively, related to the decrease in value of our deferred tax assets based on decreases in North Carolina's corporate tax rate.\nBalance Sheet Review\nTotal assets increased $44.0 million, or 1.4% to $3.3 billion at December 31, 2017 from $3.2 billion at June 30, 2017. Total liabilities increased $46.3 million, or 1.6% to $2.9 billion at December 31, 2017 from $2.8 billion at June 30, 2017. Deposit growth of $59.8 million, or 2.9% and the cumulative decrease of $63.9 million, or 19.3% in certificates of deposit in other banks and securities available for sale during the first six months of fiscal 2018 were used to partially fund the $66.5 million, or 2.8% increase in total loans, the $49.9 million, or 33.3% increase in commercial paper, and reduce borrowings by $11.5 million, or 1.7%. The increase in net loans receivable was driven by $66.8 million or 6.1% annualized of organic net loan growth. The $11.7 million, or 13.4% increase in cash and cash equivalents was mainly due to the additional funds held at the Federal Reserve Bank. The $20.9 million, or 36.4% decrease in deferred income taxes was driven by the previously mentioned revaluation as a result of the Tax Act and the use of net operating losses as our taxable income continues to increase.\nTotal deposits increased $59.8 million, or 2.9%, during the six months ended December 31, 2017 to $2.1 billion. The increase was primarily due to an increase of $79.8 million in our core deposits (which excludes certificates of deposit) as a result of recent deposit gathering initiatives, partially offset by a $20.1 million managed run off in our higher costing certificates of deposit and brokered deposits.\nStockholders' equity at December 31, 2017 decreased $2.3 million, or 0.6% to $395.4 million from $397.6 million at June 30, 2017. The decrease was primarily driven by $5.1 million in net losses, and a $601,000 decrease in other comprehensive income, partially offset by $2.0 million representing stock-based compensation, and $680,000 in a cumulative adjustment for the adoption of Accounting Standard Update 2016-09, \"Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting.\" As of December 31, 2017, HomeTrust Bank was considered \"well capitalized\" in accordance with its regulatory capital guidelines and exceeded all regulatory capital requirements with Common Equity Tier 1, Tier 1 Risk-Based, Total Risk-Based, and Tier 1 Leverage capital ratios of 11.72%, 11.72%, 12.51%, and 9.94%, respectively. In addition, the Company exceeded all regulatory capital requirements as of that date. The estimated $17.7 million deferred tax revaluation did not have a material impact on the Company's regulatory capital ratios.\nAsset Quality\nThe allowance for loan losses was $21.1 million, or 0.87% of total loans, at December 31, 2017 compared to $21.2 million, or 0.90% of total loans, at June 30, 2017. The allowance for loan losses to total gross loans excluding acquired loans was 0.97% at December 31, 2017, compared to 1.03% at June 30, 2017.\nThere was no provision for losses on loans for the six months ended December 31, 2017 and 2016. Net loan charge-offs totaled $61,000 and $306,000 for the six months ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Net charge-offs as a percentage of average loans decreased to 0.01% for the six months ended December 31, 2017 from 0.03% for the same period last fiscal year.\nNonperforming assets decreased $800,000, or 4.1% to $19.2 million, or 0.59% of total assets, at December 31, 2017 compared to $20.0 million, or 0.62% of total assets at June 30, 2017, and were $21.7 million, or 0.78% of total assets, a year ago. Nonperforming assets included $14.4 million in nonaccruing loans and $4.8 million in REO at December 31, 2017, compared to $13.7 million and $6.3 million, in nonaccruing loans and REO, respectively, at June 30, 2017. Included in nonperforming loans are $4.8 million of loans restructured from their original terms of which $2.1 million were current at December 31, 2017, with respect to their modified payment terms. At December 31, 2017, $4.6 million, or 32.1% of nonaccruing loans were current on their required loan payments. Purchased impaired loans aggregating $4.6 million obtained through prior acquisitions are excluded from nonaccruing loans due to the accretion of discounts established in accordance with the acquisition method of accounting for business combinations. Nonperforming loans to total loans was 0.59% at December 31, 2017 compared to 0.58% at June 30, 2017, and 0.82% at December 31, 2016.\nThe ratio of classified assets to total assets decreased to 1.39% at December 31, 2017 from 1.57% at June 30, 2017. Classified assets decreased 10.4% to $45.0 million at December 31, 2017 compared to $50.2 million at June 30, 2017 and were $54.8 million at December 31, 2016. Our overall asset quality metrics continue to demonstrate our commitment to growing and maintaining a high quality loan portfolio.\nAbout HomeTrust Bancshares, Inc.\nHomeTrust Bancshares, Inc. is the holding company for HomeTrust Bank.

The Company believes these non-GAAP financial measures and ratios as presented are useful for both investors and management to understand the effects of certain items and provides an alternative view of the Company's performance over time and in comparison to the Company's competitors.\nManagement elected to utilize short-term FHLB borrowings beginning in November 2014 as part of a leverage strategy to increase net interest income. The Company believes that showing the effects of these borrowings on net interest income and net interest margin is useful to both management and investors as these measures are commonly used to measure financial institution's performance and against peers.\nThe Company believes these measures facilitate comparison of the quality and composition of the Company's capital and earnings ability over time and in comparison to its competitors. These non-GAAP measures have inherent limitations, are not required to be uniformly applied and are not audited. They should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for total stockholders' equity or operating results determined in accordance with GAAP. These non-GAAP measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies.\nSet forth below is a reconciliation to GAAP of our efficiency ratio:\nThree Months Ended Six Months Ended (Dollars in thousands) December 31, September 30, December 31, December 31, December 31, 2017 2017 2016 2017 2016 Noninterest expense $ 21,175 $ 21,081 $ 20,480 $ 42,256 $ 39,611 Less merger-related expenses — — 27 — 334 Noninterest expense – as adjusted $ 21,175 $ 21,081 $ 20,453 $ 42,256 $ 39,277 Net interest income $ 25,230 $ 24,581 $ 20,415 $ 49,811 $ 41,552 Plus noninterest income 4,787 4,577 3,941 9,364 8,183 Plus tax equivalent adjustment 378 548 573 764 1,163 Less realized gain on securities — — — — — Less gain on sale of premises and equipment — 164 — 164 385 Net interest income plus noninterest income – as adjusted $ 30,395 $ 29,542 $ 24,929 $ 59,775 $ 50,513 Efficiency ratio 69.67 % 71.36 % 82.05 % 70.69 % 77.76 % Efficiency ratio (without adjustments) 70.54 % 72.30 % 84.09 % 71.41 % 79.64 % Set forth below is a reconciliation to GAAP of tangible book value and tangible book value per share:\nAs of (Dollars in thousands, except per share data) December 31, September 30, June 30, March 31, December 31, 2017 2017 2017 2017 2016 Total stockholders' equity $ 395,361 $ 405,499 $ 397,647 $ 390,746 $ 367,776 Less: goodwill, core deposit intangibles, net of deferred taxes 30,083 29,704 30,157 30,635 16,795 Tangible book value $ 365,278 $ 375,795 $ 367,490 $ 360,111 $ 350,981 Common shares outstanding 18,967,175 18,968,675 18,967,875 18,947,176 18,000,750 Tangible book value per share $ 19.26 $ 19.81 $ 19.37 $ 19.01 $ 19.50 Book value per share $ 20.84 $ 21.38 $ 20.96 $ 20.62 $ 20.43 Set forth below is a reconciliation to GAAP of tangible equity to tangible assets:\nAt or For the Three Months Ended December 31, September 30, June 30, March 31, December 31, 2017 2017 2017 2017 2016 (Dollars in thousands) Tangible equity (1) $ 365,278 $ 375,795 $ 367,490 $ 360,111 $ 350,981 Total assets 3,250,588 3,249,998 3,206,533 3,165,446 2,774,240 Less: goodwill, core deposit intangibles, net of deferred taxes 30,083 29,704 30,157 30,635 16,795 Total tangible assets (2) $ 3,220,505 $ 3,220,294 $ 3,176,376 $ 3,134,811 $ 2,757,445 Tangible equity to tangible assets 11.34 % 11.67 % 11.57 % 11.49 % 12.73 %\n(1) Tangible equity (or tangible book value) is equal to total stockholders' equity less goodwill and core deposit intangibles, net of related deferred tax liabilities.
