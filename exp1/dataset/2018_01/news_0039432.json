A comeback proved impossible on a night they suffered through 33.3 percent shooting.\nCarter made only 6 of 18 shots, Daxter Miles Jr. finished 4-of-14, and Esa Ahmad missed all five attempts in a scoreless effort by the forward who had averaged 13.7 points in his previous three-game return from suspension.\nTCU led the rebounding 46-40, with Kenrich Williams grabbing 14.\nThe Mountaineers, aiming to stay within a game of Big 12 leader Kansas, led 31-24 with 4:14 left in the first half when their shooting turned frigid and their offensive execution faltered. They missed 14 consecutive shots before Miles made a tip-in with 14:34 left in the game.\nBy that point, TCU had claimed a 47-34 lead thanks to a 23-3 run.\nThe lead eventually stretched to 66-46, with the Frogs undaunted by the ejection of forward Kouat Noi.\nThe sixth man had 13 points when he was tossed for a flagrant 2 foul. He shoved down Lamont West after the WVU player grabbed Noi from behind on a fast beak.\nEven the ejection became a positive for TCU when reserve Shawn Olden stepped in a sank three 3-pointers.\nMountaineers center Sagaba Konate had 14 points, eight rebounds and four blocks.\nKonate temporarily encountered foul trouble in the first half until replay intervened. His second foul was overturned when officials realized he merely pivoted into a low-post collision with Brodziansky.\nThe Frogs reeled off 11 unanswered points before a pair of Mountaineers free throws cut the lead to 35-33 at the half. TCU nearly led by three more but officials waived off Robinsonâ€™s 40-foot swish for being a split-second too late at the buzzer.\n--Field Level Media\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-01-23T13:23:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-23T18:00:33.013+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
