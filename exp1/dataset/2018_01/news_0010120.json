REUTERS/Kevin Lamarque South Africa’s foreign ministry called the remarks, which sources said Trump made earlier this week during a meeting on immigration legislation, “crude and offensive” and said Trump’s subsequent denial was not categorical.\n“Relations between South Africa and the United States, and between the rest of Africa and the United States, must be based on mutual respect and understanding,” the foreign ministry said in a statement on Sunday.\nIt said it would ask the second-in-charge of the U.S. embassy to explain Trump’s comments on Monday.\nTrump was widely condemned by many African countries and by international rights organisations for the comments. Botswana’s foreign ministry earlier summoned the U.S. ambassador in protest.\nReporting by Alexander Winning, editing by Louise Heavens\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-14T14:36:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-14T14:52:33.033+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
