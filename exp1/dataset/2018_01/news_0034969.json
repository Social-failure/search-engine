The bank is due to report fourth quarter results on Feb. 8.\nReporting by Silvia Aloisi in Davos; Writing by Maya Nikolaeva; Editing by Sudip Kar-Gupta and Mark Potter\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-23T13:07:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-23T13:24:40.013+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
