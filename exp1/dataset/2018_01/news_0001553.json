Thank God, I was spared and now I am back with my work and my people,” Misrati said. \n“There are amputees who have not received prosthetic legs, though some received prosthetics. Some are able to run, just like I am able to run, and to live.” \nThere are no independent estimates for overall casualties from the conflict in Benghazi, though Ahmed al-Mismari, a spokesman for Haftar’s Libyan National Army (LNA), said about 6,000 of their men had died. \nThe LNA special forces, which played a leading role in the fighting, lost about 1,500 men and had some 2,500 wounded, said Colonel Milad al-Zawi, a spokesman. \nVeterans get a one-off payment of 2,000 dinars, currently the equivalent of just $225 (166 pounds) at black market rates that set the price of many goods in Libya. Though foreign governments have flown some wounded fighters abroad for treatment, seeking medical treatment outside the country has become prohibitively expensive for most. \nIn Benghazi, daily struggles with liquidity shortages and inflation have dampened hopes brought by an end to the fighting. \n“Benghazi is full of the blood of martyrs,” said Misrati. “It wants the nation to be at rest, it wants cash, it wants uncrowded bakeries, petrol, electricity.” Writing by Aidan Lewis; Editing by Raissa Kasolowsky", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-03T15:47:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-03T16:10:32.026+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
