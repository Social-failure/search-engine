His beached boat was later found empty not far from Hossegor. \n“An air and sea search operation is underway,” the Landes prefecture said in a statement, adding that two helicopters and two boats were involved in the rescue operation. \nWinds were light, the prefecture added, but waves as high as eight feet were hampering visibility. \nBoardriders, which is 85 percent controlled by U.S. private equity firm Oaktree Capital, owns the Quiksilver, Roxy and DC Shoes brands. \nBoardriders Inc announced on Jan 5 that it had agreed to buy Australia’s Billabong International Ltd in a deal that valued the company at A$ 197.7 million $159.92 million). \n(This version of the story corrects the spelling of Quiksilver) Reporting by Claude Cannelas; writing by Michel Rose; editing by Richard Lough/Mark Heinrich", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-30T17:20:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-30T17:34:41.001+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
