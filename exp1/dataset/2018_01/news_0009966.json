Hundreds of people mobbed some supermarkets on Saturday after authorities promised price cuts.\nThe central bank has not published inflation or gross domestic product data for two years. However, the money supply expanded by more than 1,000 percent last year.\nPresident Nicolás Maduro says the problems stem from the “economic war” waged by Washington and the opposition against his government. Critics blame the government’s strict currency and price controls.\nWriting by Girish Gupta; Editing by Lisa Von Ahn\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-01-09T03:13:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-09T09:36:45.259+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
