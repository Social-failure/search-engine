The data is not classified and there was no intent to withhold it unnecessarily,” Gresback said in a statement. \nAs of October 2017, about 56 percent of Afghanistan’s territory was under Afghan government control or influence, Gresback added. \nAfghanistan has been reeling over the past nine days from a renewed spate of violence that is putting a new, more aggressive counterinsurgency strategy under the spotlight. \nAn ambulance bomb in the city centre killed more than 100 people, just over a week after an attack on the Hotel Intercontinental, also in Kabul, killed more than 20, including four U.S. citizens. \nMonday’s SIGAR report said the military had classified, for the first time since 2009, the actual and authorized total troop numbers and attrition rate for the Afghan National Defense and Security Forces, or ANDSF. \nThe U.S. military statement did not include any details about that information.
