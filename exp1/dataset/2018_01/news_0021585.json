Turkey shows a current account deficit in transportation, health, communication, energy, metallurgy, petrochemistry and the agricultural technology sectors. Turkey is also short of technology in these sectors.”\nThe talks with the companies are at the last stage and the projects will start to be operational this year, he said, although their real impact is expected to be seen next year. He did not give the names of the companies involved.\nTurkey’s 2017 current account deficit is seen at just below $50 billion, with imports as $234 billion part of it.\nReporting by Orhan Coskun and Nevzat Devranoglu; Writing by Ezgi Erkoyun; Editing by David Dolan\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-01-15T19:03:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-16T13:20:46.011+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
