Those couples would say “the pope did it, why can’t you?” one commentator wrote. \nBut the pope said the situation of the Chilean couple was a particular one because they had been already been married in a civil service eight years ago and were not able to marry in their parish church because it collapsed in a 2010 earthquake. \n“I questioned them (about marriage) and the responses were clear ... it was clear they had made a commitment for life,” the pope said, adding that the couple had even remembered subjects from the Catholic pre-marriage courses they had taken long ago. \n“Tell the pastors that they were prepared and I made a judgment call. The sacraments are for people. All the conditions were clear,” he said.
