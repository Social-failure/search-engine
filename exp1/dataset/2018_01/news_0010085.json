The club’s Spanish defender, Marc Bartra, was wounded and the match was delayed by a day.\nDefense lawyer Carl Heydenreich told journalists outside a state court in Dortmund that his client deeply regretted what he had done and that he had planned the attacks to trigger a fall in BVB’s share price from which he could profit.\nSergej W., who is suspected of detonating three bombs, targeting the Borussia Dortmund soccer team bus in April, arrives to stand trial at a German state court in Dortmund, Germany, January 8, 2018.

He said he acted for financial reasons,” Heydenreich said as his client stood before the court.\n“I believe it’s not conceivable that someone using this kind of equipment can then say ‘I‘m just doing it to scare people’ and then benefit from it,” said Alfons Becker, the club’s lawyer, referring to the explosives the accused had planted.\n($1 = 0.8352 euros)\nReporting By Reuters TV; Writing by Riham Alkousaa; Editing by Richard Balmforth\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-08T17:12:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-08T17:24:29.032+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
