They're just buying time,\" he added. \nMurphy likened governing these days to the old movies with the damsel in distress tied to the railroad tracks, where there's a \"huge catastrophic deadline\" and lawmakers \"then scramble to get to it.\" \nSenate Minority Leader Chuck Schume r, D-N.Y., said the vote to reopen the government will come Monday. He said Democrats have received assurances that the Senate will take on immigration issues, such as the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, or DACA. The program protects immigrants brought to the U.S. illegally as children. \nOnce the measure clears the Senate, it goes to the House. Then, if it is approved it goes to President Donald Trump 's desk for his signature. show chapters", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-22T22:10:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-22T22:13:34.004+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
