The stock has soared 10 percent in the past four trading days, partly in anticipation of Saudi women being allowed to drive later this year. \nThe Dubai index gained 0.6 percent as amusement park operator DXB Entertainments rose 1.6 percent and builder Arabtec climbed 1.9 percent. \nBuilder Drake & Scull, the most heavily traded stock, rose in early trade but closed 0.4 percent down at 2.29 dirhams after saying it had completed restructuring its corporate bank debt and had secured new credit lines and working capital facilities for its projects. \nThe stock had already risen from about 1.70 dirhams in early November and some analysts think it is now overvalued. \nGFH Financial fell 1.3 percent after announcing that major shareholder Integrated Capital had reduced its stake to 6.72 percent from 8.01 percent. It did not give a reason. Integrated Capital is owned by Shuaa Capital, an affiliate of Abu Dhabi Financial Group. \nA source familiar with the matter told Reuters that the shares had been bought by the Goldilocks fund, which is managed by a subsidiary of Abu Dhabi Financial Group, so the group was essentially changing the way it held the shares rather than bailing out of GFH. \nEgypt’s blue-chip index gained 1.2 percent after the market reopened following a public holiday. \nReal estate developer Palm Hills jumped 8.6 percent. After the close, the exchange said UPP Capital Investment, a unit of Dubai’s Union Properties, had bought 16 million Palm Hills shares, raising its stake to 5.68 percent. HIGHLIGHTS \n* The index edged down 0.1 percent to 7,310 points. DUBAI \n* The index gained 0.6 percent to 3,490 points. ABU DHABI \n* The index added 0.6 percent to 4,586 points. QATAR \n* The index shot up 2.6 percent to 8,976 points. EGYPT \n* The index rose 1.2 percent to 14,953 points. KUWAIT \n* The index edged down 0.1 percent to 6,498 points. BAHRAIN \n* The index edged up 0.1 percent to 1,320 points. OMAN \n* The index fell 0.2 percent to 5,108 points.
