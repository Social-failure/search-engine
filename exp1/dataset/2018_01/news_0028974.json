The House bill does not have my support. It leaves too much undone, and it is woefully inadequate,” he said in a statement. “If the majority now wants bipartisan support, they should work with Democrats, instead of appealing for our support only after they’ve written a mishmash bill crafted behind closed doors.”\nReporting by Richard Cowan and Doina Chiacu; Editing by Susan Thomas\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-01-19T02:59:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-19T00:56:56.016+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
