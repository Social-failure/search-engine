The culture ministry and the film’s director could not be reached for comment. \nThe film, which focuses on the back-stabbing and in-fighting of the Soviet leader’s closest allies as they vie for power immediately after his death, was viewed by culture ministry officials and advisors at the weekend. \n“It’s a despicable film,” said Nadezhda Usmanova, head of the Russian Military Historical Society’s department of information. The group was involved in organizing the pre-release screening. \n“It’s a bad film, it’s a boring film, and it’s vile, repugnant and insulting,” Usmanova told Reuters. \nElena Drapeko, deputy head of the culture committee in the State Duma, the lower house of Parliament, told Reuters she found “extremism” in the movie. \n“It’s an effort to breed bad blood into the social harmony that has been reached in Russian society”, said Drapeko, who earlier in her career was a popular Soviet and Russian actress. reporting by Denis Pinchuk,; writing by Polina Ivanova; Editing by Christian Lowe", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-23T16:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-23T16:56:02.042+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
