SWANSEA FORMULA \n“I told my players: Liverpool is a strong team. Like a Formula 1 car,” Swansea boss Carlos Carvalhal told Sky Sports after a win that took his side level on 20 points with second-bottom West Bromwich Albion and three off the safety zone. \n”If you put that F1 car in the 4pm London traffic, the F1 car will not drive very fast. That’s exactly what we had to do. Let them play in a way they don’t like.” \nThe plan seemed to work as the visitors struggled to find a way through the Swansea defence in the first half. Van Dijk looked composed but a lack of movement in front of him limited his options as he brought the ball out of defence. \nMawson’s goal lit a fire under the Liverpool attack and they surged forward after the break, notching 17 of their total 21 attempts on goal in the second period. \nMohamed Salah buzzed between Swansea’s defensive lines, playing clever passes and shooting as soon as he got a sight of goal as Liverpool chased an equaliser, but all too often the Merseysiders fired either high or wide of the target. \nFirmino came closest to scoring deep into stoppage time, but his header across the goal came back off the left-hand post and Adam Lallana was unable to steer home the rebound as Swansea breathed a sigh of relief at the final whistle.
