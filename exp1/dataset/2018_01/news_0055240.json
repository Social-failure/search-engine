Bahrain, a strategic island where the U.S. Navy’s Fifth Fleet is based, has a Shi‘ite Muslim majority population but is ruled by a Sunni royal family.\nBahrain has seen occasional unrest since 2011 when authorities crushed protests mainly by the Shi‘ite community demanding a bigger role in running the country.\nA London-based Bahraini activist rights group, the Bahrain Institute for Rights and Democracy (BIRD), condemned the ruling.\n“Today’s ruling is the latest episode in Bahrain’s travesty of justice, and likely one of the most cruel. The authorities have further proved their willingness to exploit the vulnerability of its citizens,” Sayed Ahmed Alwadaei, director of advocacy at BIRD, said in a statement.\nReporting By Marilyn Feghali; Editing by Peter Graff\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-31T13:18:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-31T13:33:51.037+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
