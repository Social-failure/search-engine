Another 12 tanks, with 315,000 cubic metres of capacity, are being built. \nOne of the sources said the Australian private equity firm had beaten VTTI, the storage unit of commodity trading house Vitol, to win the terminal. VTTI was not immediately available for comment. \nProstar already has a presence in the hub through a 40-percent stake in Fujairah Oil Terminal FZC, which has an overall storage capacity of 1.2 million cubic metres. The company, established in 2012, has more than $300 million under management.
