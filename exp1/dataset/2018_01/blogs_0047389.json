The Chronicle team started working on security at X in February of 2016.\nCarey Nachenberg, who spent over two decades at Symantec, is part of the group, as is Will Robinson, a 13-year Google veteran. Bernardo Quintero, who built VirusTotal and sold it to Google in 2012, is also part of Chronicle.\nAs with all of Alphabet's \"other bets,\" Chronicle will operate separately and roll up to the parent company.\n\"We'll have our own contracts and data policies with our customers, while at the same time having the benefit of being able to consult the world-class experts in machine learning and cloud computing (among many other topics) that reside in other parts of Alphabet,\" the company said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-24T22:09:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-24T22:17:54.020+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
