The traffic management system in the Chinese city of Hangzhou had resulted in reports of traffic violations with up to 92 percent accuracy, emergency vehicles reaching their destinations in half the time and overall increase in traffic speed by 15 percent.\nNajib has forged close ties with China in recent years. Last year, the Malaysian leader announced a slew of infrastructure projects, many funded by China, as he worked up momentum towards a general election he must call by the middle of this year.\nEditing by Praveen Menon and Jacqueline Wong\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-29T10:24:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-29T10:45:18.009+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
