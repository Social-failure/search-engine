Aug 29, 2017; New York, NY, USA; Elise Mertens of Belgium hits a forehand against Madison Keys of the United States (not pictured) on day two of the U.S. Open tennis tournament at USTA Billie Jean King National Tennis Center. Geoff Burke-USA TODAY Sports \nThe second-seeded Mertens recovered from a second-set lapse to edge out Watson, who won the tournament in 2015, in one hour and 42 minutes. \nThe 22-year-old world number 36 will play Mihaela Buzarnescu in Saturday’s final after the Romanian sailed past fifth-seeded Ukrainian Lesia Tsurenko 6-2 6-2 in the second semi-final. \n“She made the same run (from qualifying) as I did last year, but I‘m happy to win today,” Mertens said in an on-court interview. \n”I gave it all today, and I‘m still playing doubles later. \n“I tried to play a bit more aggressive in the third set and make her run a little bit more. She was dictating me in the second set, all credits to her. She played an amazing match.” \nAfter a tight opener which was decided by a single break of serve, Watson, ranked 74th in the world, fought back to square the match but her hopes of winning a fourth WTA title were dashed due to unforced errors. \n“(It is) just frustrating. Thought I made too many unforced errors,” Watson said. “Because I’d been playing so well, I expected more of myself.” Reporting by Sudipto Ganguly in Mumbai; Editing by John O'Brien", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-12T12:46:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-12T13:41:16.008+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
