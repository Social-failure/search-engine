And the mediocre script (by Soni and Vrushali Telang) doesn’t help.\nProtagonist Rajeev goes through the film running like a headless chicken, unsure if the events in his life are real or imaginary. He will suddenly wake up and realise that events he thought he saw with his own eyes didn’t happen, that time has been reversed, and that nothing is as it seems.\nRajeev has strange encounters with his wife, car mechanics and women who he thought were dead. While all these are meant to project the film as a psychological thriller, neither Suri nor Soni have the acting and directing chops to pull it off.\nSuri is in almost every scene and woefully inadequate - his movements are jerky and his dialogue staccato. Add to that a wafer-thin plot, excessive use of slow motion to indicate drama and a vague conclusion, and you have a film that pretty much has no redeeming qualities.\nThe views expressed in this article are not those of Reuters News.\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-01-19T18:53:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-20T17:36:06.006+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
