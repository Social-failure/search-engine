Mr. Combes, 55 years old, will assume the roles Saturday, and Sprint said he would join the company’s board at a later date.\nMr. Combes, who is from France and will relocate to the U.S., has also served as chairman and CEO of French telecommunications and media company SFR Group and CEO of Alcatel-Lucent, which was sold to Nokia .\nCurrent CFO Tarek Robbiati will leave Sprint at the end of the month, the company said. Mr. Robbiati, who has been at Sprint since 2015, helped Sprint obtain loans with lower interest rates thanks to creative financing techniques that involved using the company’s assets as collateral.\n“This is an exciting challenge and unique opportunity to help lead a distinguished company through a historic turnaround and its most exciting period yet,” Mr. Combes said in prepared remarks.\nThe logo of U.S. mobile network operator Sprint is seen at a store in San Marcos, Calif.

Mr. Combes is known as a turnaround expert with a specialty in cost-cutting.\nShares in Sprint fell 5.4% to $5.58 in Thursday morning trading.\nWrite to Allison Prang at allison.prang@wsj.com and Ryan Knutson at ryan.knutson@wsj.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-04T17:13:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-04T18:08:28.011+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
