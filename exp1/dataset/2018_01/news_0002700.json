He added that only full-time employees typically received severance packages, but that this would vary depending on local laws. \nSears’ billionaire chief executive and biggest shareholder Eddie Lampert said in July that some vendors had reduced their support, placing additional pressure on operations. In October, Whirlpool Corp ( WHR.N ), one of Sears’ biggest vendors, said it would stop supplying some big name-brand appliances to the department store chain. \nLampert is also among Sears’ biggest lenders through his hedge fund, ESL Investments.
