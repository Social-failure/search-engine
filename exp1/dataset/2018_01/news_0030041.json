Sanctions on Iran linked to its nuclear programs were lifted in January 2016, though some of its vessels often operate under other flags for reasons of convenience.\nReflagging ships masks their ownership, which could make it easier for criminal networks and sanctioned nations to obtain insurance and financing for the cargoes, as well as find buyers for the shipments without attracting attention from the U.N. and other international authorities.“I want you to conduct a thorough investigation to vet all the 470 ships that fly the Tanzanian flag,” Magufuli told security forces. “We cannot allow the image of our country to continue being undermined by some people for their own interests.”\nMagufuli said the ban on the registration of foreign ships would be in force until the system of reflagging vessels was reviewed. The Greek coastguard on Jan. 6 impounded a Tanzania-flagged freighter carrying explosives, allegedly destined to war-torn Libya. Dutch naval forces in December intercepted a Tanzania-flagged merchant vessel carrying 1.6 tonnes of cocaine.Tanzania said it has already revoked the registration of the two latest foreign-owned ships seized with illegal consignments of narcotics and weapons.\nEditing by Elias Biryabarema and Richard Balmforth\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-01-20T00:40:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-20T02:56:29.028+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
