Among them, customers have attempted to fly with comfort turkeys, gliding possums, snakes, spiders and other unusual pets.

We agree with Delta’s efforts and will continue to support the rights of customers, from veterans to people with disabilities, with legitimate needs,” the Fort Worth, Texas-based carrier   \nChicago-based United Airlines ( UAL.N ) said it was also reviewing its policy on onboard pets. \nUnder federal law, service animals are permitted to fly in-cabin with their owners, provided they do not pose a threat to the health and safety of others. \nDelta declined to say if it would be open to additional federal intervention, but the carrier had been in touch with the U.S. Department of Transportation prior to issuing the new guidance, it said.
