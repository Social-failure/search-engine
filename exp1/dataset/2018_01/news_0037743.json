You are not going to leave it on the table’. \n“I think that’s his determination, he’s going to get as much as he can out of this week.” \nSandgren, who numbered triple grand slam champion Stan Wawrinka among his victims this week, will play young gun Chung Hyeon for a place in the semi-finals. \nChung upset six-times Australian Open champion Novak Djokovic to become   reach the last eight of a grand slam. \nIronically, he played no small part in 26-year-old Sandgren’s blossoming in Melbourne. LUCKY LOSER \nSandgren faced Chung as a lucky loser at the Auckland Classic in New Zealand days before arriving for the grand slam and absorbed plenty of lessons in a three-set loss to the 21-year-old. \n“(Chung) kind of called Tennys to the carpet and said ‘can you play this level and if you can how long can you play with me?',” said Madrigal, a long-time college coach at Nashville’s Belmont University. \n”Tennys kind of buckled down any sort of emotion he had and played the very best he could. \n“He walked away from the match with a loss but a lot of experience and a lot of ‘wow, this is what I‘m going to have to do if I want to succeed at the next level’.” \nWorld number 58 Chung’s star is rising and he will be another massive challenge for Sandgren, who felt he needed to pinch himself after beating Thiem to be sure he wasn’t dreaming. \nBut the American is already playing with house money, said Madrigal, and no longer needs to worry whether he is worthy to face off for a grand slam semi-final. \nThe positive attitude helped him shrug off a huge let-down when Thiem saved a match point in the fourth set tiebreak with a scintillating backhand winner down the line. \n“Now he’s in the moment, just in the details that he wants to execute in the moment,” Madrigal said. \n“That’s why it appears he’s unfazed with pressure. He’s not thinking about ‘what could be, could I win?', all the things that can swallow you if you get engulfed in them.” Editing by Ed Osmond", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-22T15:05:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-22T15:37:41.034+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
