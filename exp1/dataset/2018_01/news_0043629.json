The Company has also completed the sale of Braddock Metro Center, a 356,000 square foot office asset in Alexandria, VA for net proceeds of approximately $79 million.\nArlington Tower, Rosslyn, VA\n“We seek to maximize our ability to create value for our shareholders by recycling capital-intensive legacy assets with single-tenant exposure into Arlington Tower, a recently upgraded, high-quality asset with a diversified tenant base and dramatic river and monument views,” said Paul T. McDermott, President and Chief Executive Officer of Washington REIT. “As we drive strong pre-leasing activity at Watergate 600, Arlington Tower enables Washington REIT to offer tenants another option with spectacular views at a meaningfully different price point, and to create a compelling value proposition for small and mid-size tenants in a resurging Rosslyn, where we have successfully repositioned and leased 1600 Wilson.”\nPlease refer to “The Opportunity to Grow and De-Risk, 2018 Asset Recycling” presentation, dated January 24, 2018, in the Investor section of the Company’s website for more information on this acquisition and disposition and the Company’s asset-recycling strategy.\nArlington Tower is approximately 95% leased to prestigious tenants including, Raytheon/BBN Technologies, Promontory Interfinancial Network, Graham Holdings, Pepco, B. Riley FBR and the National Electrical Manufacturers Association.
