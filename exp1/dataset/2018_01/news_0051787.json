This would have increased the number of foreign investors affected by the tax.\nKim noted on Monday he had been given several opinions regarding the tax change and that he met a representative of investors from Singapore. Singapore is one of the countries that South Korea does not have a tax treaty with.\nHe did not elaborate on the substance of the opinions.\n“I will fully review this issue in a responsive manner,” said Kim.\nPresident Moon Jae-in’s administration has vowed to boost household income and has imposed bigger taxes on wealthy South Koreans and leading conglomerates to fund rising welfare costs and make housing more affordable.\nThe move to widen the investor tax base includes increased capital gains taxes for domestic investors last August. Currently, capital gains tax is only applied to large shareholders with stakes exceeding 1 percent or holding 2.5 billion won worth of KOSPI-listed stocks, but will gradually be applied on a larger range of investors this year.\nAdding to investor concerns last week, international equity index compiler MSCI said the proposals on the capital gains tax thresholds for foreign investors, if implemented, could potentially decrease the amount of Korean stocks held by foreigners.\nReporting by Shinhyung Lee, Dahee Kim; Editing by Sam Holmes\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-01-29T14:27:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-30T18:45:00.013+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
