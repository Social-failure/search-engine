The shop was not licensed to sell alcohol that early in the morning, the agency added. \nWitnesses visible in the footage did not seemed particularly disturbed by the incident. \n“Basically some guy stole an armoured vehicle... and went into a shop to top up his stocks in the morning,” the social media user described, whilst filming the snow-covered scene out of his window. \nThe man, in his late twenties, did not resist arrest, RIA news agency reported.
