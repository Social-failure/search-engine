The annual cost of these projects was worth more than 10 billion pounds last year. \nEven if no new deals were agreed, the cost of these projects would reach 199 billion pounds by the 2040s, the report says. \n“Decisions that have an impact on taxpayer-funded public services for decades need to be thought through,” said Meg Hillier, Chair of the Committee of Public Accounts. “There are lessons to be learnt and these need to be considered in the context of 20 years, not just expediency today.” Reporting By Andrew MacAskill and Simon Jessop; editing by Stephen Addison", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-18T02:03:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-18T02:24:50.001+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
