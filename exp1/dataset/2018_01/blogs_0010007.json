The reclaimed metal will be used in a small decorative ring on the Yevo 1 earbuds and as the exterior of the charging case. \nVural said the company is taking pre-orders and will begin manufacturing the special edition headphones once orders are in. \n\"So far it's only been positive reactions,\" he said. \"We just hope that we can get the product out there to build awareness about the product and the metal.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-09T19:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-09T19:09:01.068+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
