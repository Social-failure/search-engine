Following 10 years where [average selling prices] have generally moved higher, we believe prices will plateau as with the rest of the industry,\" he wrote. \"We still view the iPhone base as growing, and the devices are on average getting older. However, without a compelling product cycle in September, we may see a slow upgrade cycle once again.\"\nApple shares are underperforming the market this month, down 1.3 percent through Tuesday versus the S&P 500's 5.6 percent gain.\nInvestors are growing concerned after multiple reports that Apple has cut production targets for the iPhone X by 50 percent for the March quarter.\nOther Wall Street analysts downgraded the tech giant's shares earlier this month.\nLongbow Research lowered its rating on Jan. 17 to neutral from buy, predicting the company will ship fewer iPhones than expected in fiscal 2018.\nAtlantic Equities reduced its rating on Apple shares to neutral from overweight on Jan. 22. The firm also predicted weaker-than-expected sales for the company's March quarter.\nApple did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The company's shares are up 0.4 percent Wednesday.\nâ€” CNBC's Michael Bloom contributed to this story.\nDisclaimer", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-31T14:15:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-31T14:15:09.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
