(NASDAQ:HTLF) today reported net income available to common stockholders of $13.7 million, or $0.45 per diluted common share, for the quarter ended December 31, 2017, compared to $19.1 million, or $0.74 per diluted common share, for the fourth quarter of 2016. Return on average common equity was 5.50% and return on average assets was 0.55% for the fourth quarter of 2017, compared to 10.48% and 0.92%, respectively, for the same quarter in 2016.\nNet income available to common stockholders for the year 2017 was $75.2 million, or $2.65 per diluted common share, compared to $80.1 million, or $3.22 per diluted common share, recorded during the year 2016. Return on average common equity was 8.63% and return on average assets was 0.83% for the year 2017, compared to 11.80% and 0.98%, respectively, for the same period in 2016.\nIn the fourth quarter of 2017, in response to the passage of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act by Congress, Heartland recorded a reduction in the value of its deferred tax assets, resulting in a one-time non-cash charge of $10.4 million to income tax expense. Excluding this charge to income tax expense, net income available to common stockholders for the fourth quarter of 2017 was $24.1 million or $0.80 per diluted common share, and for the year 2017, net income available to common shareholders was $85.6 million or $3.01 per diluted common share.\nCommenting on Heartland’s fourth quarter and annual results, Lynn B. Fuller, Heartland’s chairman and chief executive officer said, \"Excluding the fourth quarter tax charge, 2017 was another banner year for Heartland as we reached new heights in earnings and acquired growth. We enter 2018 with positive momentum, and we are poised for strong performance.\"\nOn November 13, 2017, Heartland entered into a definitive merger agreement with Signature Bancshares, Inc., parent company of Signature Bank headquartered in Minnetonka, Minnesota. As of the announcement date, the stock and cash transaction was valued at approximately $53.4 million. Simultaneous with the closing of the transaction, Signature Bank will merge into Heartland's Minnesota-based subsidiary, Minnesota Bank & Trust, and the combined entity will operate as Minnesota Bank & Trust. The transaction is subject to certain potential adjustments and customary closing conditions. The transaction is expected to close in the first quarter of 2018 with a systems conversion planned for the second quarter of 2018. As of December 31, 2017, Signature Bank had total assets of $409.1 million, including gross loans held to maturity of $339.1 million, and deposits of $367.8 million.\nOn December 12, 2017, Heartland entered into a definitive merger agreement with First Bank Lubbock Bancshares, Inc., parent company of FirstBank & Trust Company, headquartered in Lubbock, Texas. As of the announcement date, the aggregate merger consideration, which is comprised of Heartland common stock and cash, was approximately $185.6 million. The transaction is subject to certain potential adjustments and customary closing conditions. Upon closing of the transaction, FirstBank & Trust Company will become a wholly owned subsidiary of Heartland. The transaction is expected to close in the second quarter of 2018 with a systems conversion planned for the third quarter of 2018. As of December 31, 2017, FirstBank & Trust Company had total assets of $929.6 million, including $669.3 million of gross loans held to maturity, and deposits of $821.9 million.\nNet Interest Margin Increases As a Percentage of Average Earning Assets and Increases In Dollars\nNet interest margin, expressed as a percentage of average earning assets, was 4.14% (4.30% on a fully tax-equivalent basis) during the fourth quarter of 2017, compared to 4.08% (4.26% on a fully tax-equivalent basis) during the third quarter of 2017 and 3.96% (4.14% on a fully tax-equivalent basis) during the fourth quarter of 2016.\nFuller said, “Heartland’s strong net interest margin stands out among its peers. Our fully-tax-equivalent margin widened for the quarter and annual periods to 4.30 percent and 4.22 percent, respectively.”\nInterest income for the fourth quarter of 2017 was $102.1 million, an increase of $19.3 million or 23%, compared to the $82.8 million recorded in the fourth quarter of 2016. The tax-equivalent adjustment, which accounts for income taxes saved on the interest earned on nontaxable securities and loans, was $3.6 million for the fourth quarter of 2017 and $3.5 million for the fourth quarter of 2016. With these adjustments, interest income on a tax-equivalent basis was $105.6 million for the fourth quarter of 2017, an increase of $19.3 million or 22%, compared to $86.3 million for the fourth quarter of 2016. The increase in interest income in the fourth quarter of 2017, as compared to the fourth quarter of 2016, was primarily due to an increase in average earning assets, which totaled $8.89 billion during the fourth quarter of 2017 compared to $7.55 billion during the fourth quarter of 2016, a $1.34 billion or 18% increase. A majority of this growth was attributable to the acquisitions completed in 2017.\nInterest expense for the fourth quarter of 2017 was $9.2 million, an increase of $1.6 million or 21% from $7.6 million in the fourth quarter of 2016. Average interest bearing liabilities for the quarter ended December 31, 2017, totaled $5.66 billion, an increase of $457.4 million or 9% from $5.21 billion in the same quarter in 2016. The average interest rate paid on Heartland's interest bearing deposits and borrowings increased 7 basis points from 0.58% in the fourth quarter of 2016 to 0.65% in the fourth quarter of 2017. The average interest rate paid on savings deposits was 0.31% during the fourth quarter of 2017 compared to 0.21% during the fourth quarter of 2016, and the average interest rate paid on time deposits was 0.82% during the fourth quarter of 2017 compared to 0.77% during the fourth quarter of 2016.\nNet interest income increased $17.7 million or 24% to $92.9 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 from the $75.2 million recorded in the fourth quarter of 2016. After the tax-equivalent adjustment discussed above, net interest income on a tax-equivalent basis totaled $96.4 million during the fourth quarter of 2017, an increase of $17.7 million or 23% from the $78.7 million recorded during the fourth quarter of 2016.\nNoninterest Income and Noninterest Expenses Increase From Fourth Quarter 2016\nNoninterest income totaled $25.5 million during the fourth quarter of 2017 compared to $24.5 million during the fourth quarter of 2016, an increase of $1.1 million or 4%. Service charges and fees totaled $9.9 million during the fourth quarter of 2017 compared to $8.1 million during the fourth quarter of 2016, an increase of $1.8 million or 22%. This increase was primarily attributable to a larger demand deposit customer base, a portion of which was the result of the Founders Bancorp acquisition completed in the first quarter of 2017 and the Citywide Banks of Colorado, Inc., acquisition completed in the third quarter of 2017. Gains on sale of loans held for sale totaled $4.3 million during the fourth quarter of 2017 compared to $5.8 million during the fourth quarter of 2016, a decrease of $1.6 million or 27%. Trust fees increased $618,000 or 17% to $4.3 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 compared to $3.7 million for the same quarter of 2016.\nFor the fourth quarter of 2017, noninterest expenses totaled $77.9 million compared to $69.9 million during the fourth quarter of 2016, an increase of $8.0 million or 11%. The category with the most significant increase was salaries and employee benefits, which increased $4.2 million or 11%. Full time equivalent employees totaled 2,008 as of December 31, 2017, compared to 1,864 as of December 31, 2016. Professional fees totaled $8.5 million for the fourth quarter of 2017, an increase of $1.3 million or 19% from $7.2 million recorded during the fourth quarter of 2016 primarily due to the recently completed and pending acquisitions.\nHeartland's effective tax rate was 61.13% for the fourth quarter of 2017 compared to 30.38% for the fourth quarter of 2016. Exclusive of the charge to income tax expense of $10.4 million recorded as a result of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, Heartland's effective tax rate was 31.58% for the fourth quarter of 2017. Heartland's effective tax rate was also affected by the level of tax-exempt interest income which, as a percentage of pre-tax income, was 18.78% during the fourth quarter of 2017 compared to 23.69% during the fourth quarter of 2016.\n\"The passage of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act required us to revalue our deferred tax assets at the new federal tax rate of 21%. While the $10.4 million non-cash charge to income tax expense negatively impacted earnings for the fourth quarter of 2017, we expect the new legislation will have a positive impact on our future earnings,\" stated Fuller.\nLoans and Deposits Increase Since December 31, 2016\nTotal assets were $9.81 billion at December 31, 2017, an increase of $1.56 billion or 19% from $8.25 billion at year-end 2016. Included in this increase, at fair value, were $213.9 million of assets acquired in the Founders Bancorp transaction and $1.49 billion of assets acquired in the Citywide Banks of Colorado, Inc. transaction. Exclusive of these transactions, total assets decreased $144.0 million or 2%. Securities represented 25% of total assets at December 31, 2017, compared to 26% at December 31, 2016.\nTotal loans held to maturity were $6.39 billion at December 31, 2017, compared to $5.35 billion at year-end 2016, an increase of $1.04 billion or 19%. This increase included $1.08 billion of total loans held to maturity, at fair value, acquired in the Founders Bancorp and Citywide Banks of Colorado, Inc. transactions. Exclusive of these transactions, total loans held to maturity decreased $42.1 million during the year 2017. Loan growth for the fourth quarter of 2017 totaled $18.0 million.\nTotal deposits were $8.15 billion as of December 31, 2017, compared to $6.85 billion at year-end 2016, an increase of $1.30 billion or 19%. This increase included $1.39 billion of deposits, at fair value, acquired in the Founders Bancorp and Citywide Banks of Colorado, Inc. transactions. Exclusive of these transactions, total deposits decreased $92.0 million. Demand deposits totaled $2.98 billion at December 31, 2017, an increase of $781.2 million or 35% from $2.20 billion at year-end 2016. Excluding $626.7 million of demand deposits attributable to the Founders Bancorp and Citywide Banks of Colorado, Inc. transactions, demand deposits increased $154.5 million or 7% since year-end 2016. Savings deposits increased $452.2 million or 12% to $4.24 billion at December 31, 2017, from $3.79 billion at December 31, 2016. Excluding savings deposits of $619.0 million acquired in the Founders Bancorp and Citywide Banks of Colorado, Inc. transactions, savings deposits decreased $166.7 million or 4% since year-end 2016. Time deposits totaled $923.5 million as of December 31, 2017, compared to $857.3 million as of December 31, 2016, an increase of $66.2 million. Exclusive of $145.9 million of time deposits acquired during 2017, time deposits decreased $79.7 million or 9% since December 31, 2016.\n\"Aided by acquisitions, loans and deposits increased by 19 percent over the previous year. Loans and non-time deposits also grew organically during the second half of 2017. These growth trends provide significant momentum for Heartland going into 2018,\" commented Fuller.\nNonperforming Assets Remain Constant; Provision for Loan Losses Increases Since December 31, 2016\nNonperforming assets were $74.6 million at December 31, 2017, compared to $74.8 million at December 31, 2016. Exclusive of $8.0 million of nonperforming assets, at fair value, acquired in the Citywide Banks of Colorado, Inc. transaction, nonperforming assets decreased $8.2 million or 11% since year-end 2016. Nonperforming loans were $63.4 million or 0.99% of total loans at December 31, 2017, compared to $64.4 million or 1.20% of total loans at December 31, 2016.\nThe allowance for loan losses at December 31, 2017, was 0.87% of loans and 87.82% of nonperforming loans compared to 1.02% of loans and 84.37% of nonperforming loans at December 31, 2016. The provision for loan losses was $5.3 million and $2.2 million for the fourth quarter of 2017 and 2016, respectively. Given the size of Heartland's loan portfolio, the level of organic loan growth, acquired loans that move out of the purchase accounting pool, changes in credit quality and the variability that can occur in the factors considered when determining the appropriateness of the allowance for loan losses, Heartland's quarterly provision for loan losses will vary from quarter to quarter.\n\"In 2017, Heartland successfully executed on its strategy to deliver growth and profitability while maintaining assets below the $10 billion threshold. Closing the year at $9.8 billion in assets affords us 18 months to prepare for the adverse revenue impact of the Dodd Frank Act, which will significantly reduce debit card interchange income. In 2018, we will continue to deliver on our growth strategy by adding Signature Bank and FirstBank & Trust Company and expect to finish the year above $11 billion in total assets,\" Fuller concluded.\nConference Call Details\nHeartland will host a conference call for investors at 5:00 p.m. EDT today.
