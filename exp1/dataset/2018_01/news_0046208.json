The rupee gained 0.2 percent for the week. \nOn Tuesday, the rupee hit a record intraday low of 154.20/25 per dollar. \n“There was no big demand today. There were some exporter (dollar) sales and inward remittances,” said a currency dealer. \nDealers expect a 2-3 percent depreciation this year. \nThe rupee might see volatility due to heavy debt repayment by the government this year, said dealers. \nSri Lanka raised $470.6 million last week via development bonds, the central bank said. \nPresident Maithripala Sirisena’s administration must repay an estimated 1.97 trillion rupees ($12.85 billion) in 2018 - a record high - including $2.9 billion of foreign loans, and a total of $5.36 billion in interest. \nForeign investors bought 2.1 billion rupees worth of government securities this year up to Jan. 18, central bank data showed. \nThe rupee fell 2.5 percent last year, and 3.9 percent in 2016.
