She was dictating me in the second set, all credits to her. She played an amazing match.” \nAfter a tight opener which was decided by a single break of serve, Watson, ranked 74th in the world, fought back to square the match but her hopes of winning a fourth WTA title were dashed due to unforced errors. \n“(It is) just frustrating. Thought I made too many unforced errors,” Watson said. “Because I’d been playing so well, I expected more of myself.” (Reporting by Sudipto Ganguly in Mumbai; Editing by John O‘Brien)", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-12T11:49:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-12T12:11:24.017+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
