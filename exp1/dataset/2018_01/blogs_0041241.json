Meanwhile, 61 percent said they are fully honest with their partner about their finances.\nAnd 31 percent of survey respondents said keeping credit cards and other accounts from a partner is worse than physical infidelity.\nThe reasons for the dishonesty around finances range from failure to communicate to straight up deceit.\nFinancial professionals who handle these situations regularly say there are some tell-tale signals to watch out for.\nWarning signs show chapters Recognizing the signs of financial infidelity 5:58 PM ET Fri, 7 Feb 2014 First, notice when your mail no longer includes financial statements, such as credit card bills or solicitations and investment account information, said Lili Vasileff, founder and president of Divorce and Money Matters in Greenwich, Connecticut.\nNext, watch out for atypical behavior. That can include lavishing you with gifts or insisting that you account for every nickel and dime, Vasileff said.\n\"The reason for that is their own behavior has changed and they're trying to deflect from it,\" Vasileff said.\nVasileff recalled how one husband decided the couple should downsize their home and booked a cruise so they could spend more time together.\nShortly thereafter, the wife was in a new condo and the husband walked away from the marriage. The wife \"never saw it coming,\" Vasileff said.\nAlso, Vasileff said to watch out for changes in habits.\n\"It's really true when people are having an affair that they start buying new underwear\" or going to the gym regularly, said Peggy Tracy, owner of Priority Planning in Wheaton, Illinois.\nBe on the lookout for changes income or cash flow, including cash withdrawals or checks made out to cash. Tracy helped one client realize her husband had a drug problem when their financial records revealed regular withdrawals of $200 every other day.\nSteps to take If you feel that you have been duped, you want to make sure you have concrete evidence, Vasileff said. That includes finding out how much money you are taking in and what is really being spent.\n\"There's nothing worse than having that accusation being disproved within three minutes,\" Vasileff said. Or worse, spending a lot of money to investigate where the funds have gone.\n\"If you're looking for $10,000 and it costs you $15,000 to find it, it's ridiculous,\" Vasileff said.\nCouples can work to prevent the need from hiding their spending in the first place by sitting down to talk about money when it's not contentious, Vasileff suggested.\nThese plans can include setting aside an amount of money — say $10,000 each — that each individual does not have to account for.\nFor situations that are contentious, remember that everything leaves a paper trail, Tracy said.\n\"It is the truth,\" Tracy said. \"It is black and white and cannot be argued with.\"\nDocuments helped Tracy identify hundreds of thousands of dollars one client's husband had hidden through estimated payments to the Internal Revenue Service.\nThe good news for the other spouse in these situations is that you generally are entitled to half of marital money that is spent on non-marital items, Tracy said.\nBefore it gets to that point, the best thing to do is to speak up when you first notice that something is off.\n\"You know in your heart what's going on,\" Tracy said. \"Either you're going to stick your head in the sand or have the courage to confront it.\"\nMore from Personal Finance:\n'I know you cheated on your wife.'
