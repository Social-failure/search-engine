The decrease is mainly due to prior period net manufactured housing sales including $8,092,000 attributable to facilities in Elkhart, Indiana and Mansfield, Texas which closed in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017. Modular housing net sales partially offset the decrease as a result of multiple facilities experiencing increased customer demand for this product. Operating income for fiscal 2018 was $3,001,000 as compared to an operating loss of $509,000 for fiscal 2017. Current year operating income includes a $762,000 net gain on the sale of property, plant and equipment. Prior year's operating loss included a $1,362,000 loss, excluding corporate overhead allocation, attributable to the Elkhart and Mansfield facilities.

The decrease is mainly due to prior period net manufactured housing sales including $13,293,000 attributable to the Elkhart and Mansfield facilities. Modular housing net sales partially offset the decrease as a result of multiple facilities experiencing increased customer demand for this product. In addition, park model net sales rose as a result of management's continuing initiative to increase this product's exposure at substantially all of the Corporation's facilities. Operating income for fiscal 2018 was $4,755,000 as compared to operating income of $321,000 for fiscal 2017.
