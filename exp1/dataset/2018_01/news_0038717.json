He was finally removed when Lungi Ngidi (1-27) induced an edge to AB de Villiers at third slip.\nDe Villiers bruised the middle finger of his right hand in taking the catch and had to leave the field for treatment.\nCricket - India v South Africa - Third Test match - The Wanderers Stadium, Johannesburg, South Africa - January 24, 2018. India’s Virat Kohli leaves the pitch after being dismissed by South Africa's Lungi Ngidi. REUTERS/James Oatway Cheteshwar Pujara (50) was the only other Indian batsman to post a half-century, with his patient innings taking 179 deliveries as he tried to stifle the home attack.\nHe had a slice of early luck when given not out after Ngidi struck him on the pads. South Africa did not review umpire Ian Gould’s decision and replays showed the ball would have hit leg stump.\nSlideshow (4 Images) Pujara’s vigil came to an end when he edged all-rounder Andile Phehlukwayo (2-25) to wicketkeeper Quinton de Kock, one of five dismissals for the gloveman.\nRabada (3-39) was perhaps the pick of the home bowlers, both fast and accurate. He removed opener Murali Vijay (8), caught by De Kock, before grabbing the wickets of Ishant Sharma (0) and the stubborn Kumar (30).\nMorne Morkel (2-47) and Vernon Philander (2-31) also chipped in with wickets but were guilty at times of bowling with too much width, failing to make the batsmen play.\nThe home side had already claimed the series with an unassailable 2-0 lead but are chasing a first clean-sweep against India.\nReporting By Nick Said; Editing by David Goodman\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-24T12:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-24T13:12:28.023+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
