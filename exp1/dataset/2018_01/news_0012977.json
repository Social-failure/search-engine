REUTERS/Ludovic MARIN/Pool \nAhead of Macron’s trip, sources had told Reuters that Airbus was in talks about an order for 100 or more jets. New jet orders have historically featured during such tours by French leaders. \nWhile no deal has been finalised over the current official visit, Macron said China had assured him it would respect market-share parity between Airbus and Boeing. Slideshow (5 Images) \nChina regularly splits large orders between Europe and the United States to cope with its fast-expanding airline traffic, but the momentum has recently been with rival Boeing, which sold 300 jets during a visit by U.S. President Donald Trump last year. \nChina, however, placed a large order for 140 Airbus jets during a visit to Germany by Xi last July. \nAirbus signed a provisional deal on Tuesday to boost the number of A320 family jets assembled in Tianjin to six a month by 2020 from four at present. \nAirbus declined to comment on Wednesday.
