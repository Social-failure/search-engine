It will also take a one-off 2 million pound charge as it manages its cost base.\n“We expect trading conditions to remain challenging throughout 2018,” said Chief Executive Nic Budden.\n“We are well placed to withstand these conditions due to our strong balance sheet with no debt, and we will provide an update on a number of strategic initiatives which we have been working on.”\nFoxtons, which had been a symbol of the British capital’s property boom, saw its profits more than halve in 2016 and had said in as early as 2014 that the once runaway real estate market was cooling.\n$1 = 0.7008 pounds Reporting by Costas Pitas\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-01-25T15:16:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-26T21:21:23.032+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
