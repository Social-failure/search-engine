But we don't see that dramatic rise in inflation or that tremendous pick-up longer term in growth that is going to make for a much steeper yield curve,\" Haefele added.\nTax reform And while it was \"a long way\" before markets knew the effect tax reform stateside would have on inflation, there would be a few near-term effects, according to Haefele.\n\"First, it's going to help corporate earnings and that is good for the market,\" he said.\nThe Republican tax bill signed into law last month saw the corporate tax rate slashed from 35 percent to 21 percent. Those lower rates are expected to be a plus for corporate earnings, although some companies will have to bear one-off charges due to changes in tax policy.\n\"And second, I think that investors and companies are looking ahead to the 2018 election and maybe thinking that the Republicans, which tend to be more business-friendly, can do well. So those two factors have contributed to some of the gains we've seen at the beginning of the year,\" Haefele added, referring to upcoming midterm elections in the U.S.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-16T09:33:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-16T10:53:11.080+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
