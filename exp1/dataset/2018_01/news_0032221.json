However, we do believe substantial change is needed after years of poor performance,” Starboard said in a letter to Mellanox shareholders.\nMellanox was not immediately available for comment.\nIn December, Mellanox forecast low- to mid-teens revenue growth for fiscal 2018, compared with an estimated 0.5 percent rise, but a far cry from 19 percent to 30 percent growth rates between 2014 and 2016. ( bit.ly/2nCz1zI )\nStarboard had criticized Mellanox’s 2018 targets last week, saying they were insufficient.\nThe New York hedge fund said on Wednesday that substantial change is “required and warranted” on the board of Mellanox in order to provide a new plan for the future.\nShares of Mellanox have risen nearly 14 percent since Starboard disclosed its stake in the company in November.\nMellanox reports its fourth-quarter results on Thursday.
