The iron ore price stands at around $75 per tonne. However, uncertainty over Chinese demand has led to forecasts for prices to fall to between $51 and $64 a tonne as the year progresses.\nSpot iron ore last traded below $52 in June 2017.\nIn other commodities, BHP’s copper output jumped 20 percent to 429,000 tonnes in the quarter helped by a rise in production from its Escondida copper mine in Chile. Petroleum production slipped by 6 percent to 48 million barrels of oil.\nIn the closely watched U.S. onshore shale division, the company said it continued to assess alternatives to exit its onshore U.S. assets and that it would also continue to explore a demerger or an initial public offering.\nLast month, BHP appointed four investment bankers to help it sell or a spin off the division, which has proved a disastrous investment for the company.\nReporting By Rushil Dutta in Bengaluru; Editing by Cynthia Osterman\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-01-18T06:28:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-18T12:22:41.027+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
