The airline is owned by the government of Dubai, one of seven emirates in the UAE federation. It gave no details of the second flight. \nQatar’s foreign ministry said the UAE allegation followed incidents on Dec. 21 and Jan. 3 in which UAE military aircraft had violated its airspace. \nMinistry spokeswoman Lulwa Rashed al-Khater said Qatar planned to take legal action against the UAE over the incidents. \n“It seems that the Civil Aviation Authority in the UAE, by publishing false claims, is trying to pre-empt events and cover over news of the Emirati plane penetration of Qatari airspace,” Khater said in the statement, posted on the ministry’s website. \nOn Friday, Qatar said it had filed a complaint with the United Nations about the alleged violation of its airspace on Dec. 21. The UAE denied the allegation.
