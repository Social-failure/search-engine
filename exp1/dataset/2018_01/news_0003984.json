That was later shown to be misleading, and Trump Jr. has said that the purpose of the meeting was to discuss potential dirt on political rival Hillary Clinton .\nAdvisors to the president told The Washington Post in July that the initial statement could raise questions about whether the president is attempting to hide something .\nCorallo did not respond to a request for comment from CNBC.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-04T16:59:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-04T17:01:17.007+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
