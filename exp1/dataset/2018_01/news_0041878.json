No-one has been accused of Regeni’s murder. \n“The motive can be easily traced to Giulio’s research activities during his months in Cairo,” Pignatone wrote. \n“What also has become clear is that Giulio had for months attracted the attention of Egypt’s state apparatus, which continued in an increasingly pressing way until Jan. 25,” Pignatone said, referring to the day he disappeared. \nRegeni’s disfigured body was found around a week later in a ditch outside Cairo. \nThe Italian had been researching Egypt’s independent labour unions for a doctorate at Britain’s Cambridge University. Rome prosecutors this month seized the computer and cell phone of his Cambridge tutor, Maha Abdelrahman. Pignatone said an initial examination of the material showed it was “useful”. \nCambridge University has rejected any suggestion Abdelrahman might be implicated in his death. \nThe Regeni case has strained ties between Egypt and Italy, which recalled its ambassador over the case. Relations were restored in August when Rome said it would return its ambassador to Cairo and continue to search for Regeni’s killers.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-25T21:36:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-25T21:58:10.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
