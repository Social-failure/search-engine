I am especially pleased with our new deal momentum as we added a record 10 new customer wins globally during the quarter. We also experienced a 67% year-over-year growth in cloud revenue and a 55% year-over-year increase in cloud subscription revenue, reflecting the strategic and fundamental change in our business model towards the cloud.”\n“Majesco is at the forefront of the change to Digital 2.0 with the IBM partnership on its Insurance Industry platform, our micro services based Digital 1 st Platform, and our growing partner ecosystem on Majesco’s CloudInsurer platform. With the Insurance industry embracing platform economics like many other industries, the shift to Digital Insurance 2.0 is intensifying, responding to new expectations on customer experience, innovations and business models in the digital age. ”\n“Our growing business momentum validates our strategy and the specific solutions offered to the market. Our pipeline of potential new customers remains strong and I am excited by the opportunities to support our customers’ transition to the Insurance 2.0 digital platform,” stated Ketan Mehta, Majesco’s CEO and Co-Founder.\nFinancial Highlights\nFor the third quarter ended December 31, 2017\nRevenue for the third quarter ended December 31, 2017 was $31.8 million as compared to $30.0 million in the corresponding quarter of last fiscal year. The 5.9% increase during the quarter was due to the new programs in North America as well as growth in the APAC region. Sequentially revenue increased 4.7% as compared to the previous quarter ended September 30, 2017. Gross profit was $14.9 million (46.9% of revenue) for the third quarter ended December 31, 2017, compared to $14.7 million (49.0% of revenue) December 31, 2016. The decrease in margin was primarily due to the ramp-up of resources to support the revenue growth in the coming quarters. Sequentially gross profit margin was higher by 208 basis points as compared to the quarter ended September 30, 2017, due to revenue growth and improved delivery efficiencies. Research and development (R&D) expenses were $4.5 million (14.3% of revenue) during the third quarter ended December 31, 2017, as compared to $4.0 million (13.2% of revenue) during the quarter ended December 31, 2016. The company continues to invest in R&D to increase the depth as well as range of the offering portfolio. SG&A expenses were $10.3 million (32.3% of revenue) during the third quarter ended December 31, 2017, as compared to $10.6 million (35.2% of revenue) December 31, 2016. With the growth in revenue, the decline in SG&A as a percentage of revenue reflects an improvement in our operating leverage. Adjusted EBITDA for the third quarter ended December 31, 2017 was $2.2 million (6.8% of revenue) as compared to $1.7 million (5.8% of revenue) December 31, 2016. Sequentially Adjusted EBITDA, as a percentage of revenue, was higher by 340 basis points as compared to the previous quarter ended September 30, 2017. Net loss for the third quarter ended December 31, 2017 was $3.1 million, or $(0.08) per share as compared to net income of $0.2 million, or $0.01 per diluted share, December 31, 2016. In the current quarter the company made an adjustment of $ 2.67 million or $0.07 per share to write down the company’s deferred tax asset in line with the recent changes made to the Tax Code.\nEBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are non-GAAP measures. Reconciliation tables of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA as used in this press release to GAAP are included in the financial section of this press release.\nFor the nine months ended December 31, 2017\nRevenue for the nine months ended December 31, 2017 was $90.0 million as compared to $93.6 million in the corresponding nine months of last fiscal year. The 3.8% decrease during the nine months was due to subscription based cloud programs with lower implementation revenues, which replaced several on-premise P&C programs moving from implementation to support services. Gross profit was $40.4 million (44.9% of revenue) for the nine months ended December 31, 2017, compared to $44.9 million (48.0% of revenue) for the nine months ended December 31, 2016. The decline in gross profit margin was primarily due to lower revenue and the ramp up of resources to support revenue growth in the coming quarters. R&D expenses were $12.7 million (14.1% of revenue) during the nine months ended December 31, 2017 as compared to $13.0 million (13.9% of revenue) during the nine months ended December 31, 2016. SG&A expenses were $31.0 million (34.5% of revenue) during the nine months ended December 31, 2017 as compared to $31.9 million (34.0% of revenue) for the nine months ended December 31, 2016. Adjusted EBITDA for the nine months ended December 31, 2017 was $2.8 million\n(3.1% of revenue) as compared to $4.5 million (4.8% of revenue) for the nine months ended December 31, 2016. Net loss for the nine months ended December 31, 2017 was $5.4 million, or $(0.15) per share as compared to a net loss of $0.1 million, or $(0.00) per share, for the nine months ended December 31, 2016.\nEBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are non-GAAP measures.

We define EBITDA as earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization. We present EBITDA because we believe it is frequently used by securities analysts, investors and other interested parties as a measure of financial performance. We define Adjusted EBITDA as EBITDA before stock-based compensation.\nThe terms EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are not defined under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, or U.S. GAAP, and are not a measure of operating income, operating performance or liquidity presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA have limitations as an analytical tool, and when assessing Majesco’s operating performance, investors should not consider EBITDA or Adjusted EBITDA in isolation, or as a substitute for net income (loss) or other consolidated income statement data prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Among other things, EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA do not reflect our actual cash expenditures. Other companies may calculate similar measures differently than Majesco, limiting their usefulness as comparative tools. We compensate for these limitations by relying on U.S. GAAP results and using EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA only supplementally.\nAbout Majesco\nMajesco enables insurance business transformation for approximately 150 global customers by providing technology solutions which include software products, consulting and IT services. Our customers are carriers from the Property and Casualty, Life, Annuity and Group insurance segments worldwide.
