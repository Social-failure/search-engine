Morgan analyst Sandeep Deshpande cut his recommendation on the stock to “neutral” from “overweight”, citing risks to weaker near-term earnings.\n$1 = 0.8057 euros Reporting by Thyagaraju Adinarayan with additional reporting by Bartosz Dabrowski in Gdynia; Editing by Gopakumar Warrier\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-29T09:47:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-29T10:02:48.002+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
