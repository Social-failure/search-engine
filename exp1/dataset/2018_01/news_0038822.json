All share data has been adjusted to reflect Horizon’s three-for-two stock split effective November 14, 2016.\nSUMMARY:\nNet income for the year ended December 31, 2017 was $33.1 million, or $1.43 diluted earnings per share, compared to $23.9 million, or $1.19 diluted earnings per share, for the year ended December 31, 2016. Net income, excluding acquisition-related expenses, gain on sale of investment securities, prepayment penalties on borrowings, gain on the accounting for Horizon’s equity interest in Lafayette Community Bancorp (“Lafayette”), tax reform bill impact and purchase accounting adjustments (“core net income”) for the year ended December 31, 2017 increased 21.4% to $35.5 million or $1.53 diluted earnings per share compared to $29.2 million or $1.45 diluted earnings per share for the year of 2016. Net income for the fourth quarter of 2017 was $7.6 million, or $0.30 diluted earnings per share, compared to $8.2 million, or $0.36 diluted earnings per share, for the third quarter of 2017 and $5.6 million, or $0.25 diluted earnings per share, for the fourth quarter of 2016. Core net income for the fourth quarter of 2017 was $10.1 million, or $0.40 diluted earnings per share, compared to $9.2 million, or $0.41 diluted earnings per share, for the third quarter of 2017 and $8.5 million, or $0.38 diluted earnings per share, for the fourth quarter of 2016. Return on average assets was 0.97% for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to 0.81% for the year ended December 31, 2016. Return on average assets, excluding acquisition-related expenses, gain on sale of investment securities, prepayment penalties on borrowings, gain on the accounting for Horizon’s equity interest in Lafayette, tax reform bill impact and purchase accounting adjustments (“core return on average assets”), for the year ended December 31, 2017 was 1.04% compared to 0.99% for the year ended December 31, 2016. Total loans increased by a rate of 32.2%, or $691.0 million, during 2017. Total loans, excluding acquired loans, increased by a rate of 11.3%, or $242.7 million, during 2017. Commercial loans increased by a rate of 51.2%, or $547.9 million, during 2017. Commercial loans, excluding acquired commercial loans, increased by a rate of 14.3%, or $152.7 million, during 2017. Consumer loans increased by a rate of 28.7%, or $114.4 million, during 2017. Consumer loans, excluding acquired consumer loans, increased by a rate of 26.3%, or $104.7 million, during 2017. Net interest income increased $26.1 million, or 30.4%, to $112.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to $86.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. Net interest margin was 3.75% for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to 3.29% for the year ended December 31, 2016. The improvement in net interest margin from the prior year was due to Horizon executing a strategy to reduce expensive funding costs in the fourth quarter of 2016, an increase in average interest-earning assets, an increase in loan yields and the increase in interest rates during 2017. Net interest margin, excluding the impact of prepayment penalties on borrowings and purchase accounting adjustments (“core net interest margin”), was 3.64% for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to 3.38% for the year ended December 31, 2016. Horizon’s tangible book value per share increased following the acquisitions of Lafayette and Wolverine Bancorp, Inc. (“Wolverine”) to $12.72 at December 31, 2017, compared to $12.38 and $11.48 at September 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016, respectively. On October 17, 2017, Horizon closed on the merger with Wolverine and its wholly-owned subsidiary, Wolverine Bank, headquartered in Midland, Michigan. The related system integration was successfully completed on November 10, 2017.\nCraig Dwight, Chairman and CEO, commented: “I am very pleased to announce Horizon Bancorp’s 2017 results and the incredible effort put forth by our entire team. Horizon’s performance for the year required an incredible team effort, based on the fact that we reported solid organic loan growth and successfully closed on a single branch acquisition and two whole-banks mergers. In addition, we were able to improve our net interest margin as a result of changes we made to our balance sheet in the fourth quarter of 2016 and therefore realized the benefits of said changes in 2017. Horizon’s core net income of $10.1 million for the fourth quarter and $35.5 million for the year is an increase of 19.0% and 21.4%, respectively, when compared to the prior year. Core diluted earnings per share increased 5.3%, to $0.40, for the fourth quarter and 5.5%, to $1.53, for 2017 when compared to the prior year.”\nDwight continued, “We continued to follow our balanced strategy of well-executed acquisitions and organic growth throughout 2017. During the first quarter of 2017, Horizon completed the acquisition of a single branch of First Farmers Bank & Trust Company located in Bargersville, Indiana which added $3.4 million in loans and $14.8 million in deposits and enhanced our presence in this attractive and rapidly growing central Indiana market. During the third quarter of 2017, we completed the acquisition of Lafayette Community Bancorp adding an experienced team of bankers to capitalize on future opportunities in the growth market of Lafayette, Indiana. Horizon also completed the acquisition of Wolverine Bancorp, Inc. during the fourth quarter of 2017 adding another experienced team of bankers located at three full-service locations in the Great Lakes Bay Region of Michigan and a loan production office in Troy, Michigan. The acquisitions of Lafayette and Wolverine increased total loans by $445.0 million.”\nMr. Dwight concluded, “In addition to these acquisitions, we continued to execute our organic growth strategy and experienced solid loan growth in 2017. Total loans, excluding acquired loans, loans held for sale and mortgage warehouse loans increased by 14.4%, or $288.9 million, primarily due to commercial and consumer loan growth. Horizon’s growth markets of Fort Wayne, Grand Rapids, Indianapolis and Kalamazoo, grew by $109.1 million, or 27.5%, during the year. The addition of a seasoned consumer loan portfolio manager during the third quarter of 2016 and an increased focus on the management of direct consumer loans resulted in an increase of 26.3% in consumer loans during 2017.”\nIncome Statement Highlights\nNet income for the fourth quarter of 2017 was $7.6 million, or $0.30 diluted earnings per share, compared to $8.2 million, or $0.36 diluted earnings per share, for the third quarter of 2017 and $5.6 million, or $0.25 diluted earnings per share, for the fourth quarter of 2016. Excluding acquisition-related expenses, gain on sale of investment securities, prepayment penalties on borrowings, gain on the accounting for Horizon’s equity interest in Lafayette, tax reform bill impact and purchase accounting adjustments (“core net income”), net income for the fourth quarter of 2017 was $10.1 million, or $0.40 diluted earnings per share, compared to $9.2 million, or $0.41 diluted earnings per share, for the third quarter of 2017 and $8.5 million, or $0.38 diluted earnings per share, for the fourth quarter of 2016.\nThe decrease in net income from the third quarter of 2017 to the fourth quarter of 2017 reflects increases in income tax expense of $3.3 million, non-interest expense of $1.8 million and provision for loan losses of $390,000, partially offset by increases in net interest income of $3.6 million and non-interest income of $1.3 million. In addition to the decrease in net income, diluted earnings per share decreased due to the stock issued in the Lafayette and Wolverine acquisitions. The increase in income tax expense was primarily due to the $2.4 million adjustment of Horizon’s net deferred tax assets to the new corporate tax rate. The increase in non-interest income reflects the finalized entries of the Lafayette acquisition which resulted in a gain on the accounting for Horizon’s previous equity interest in Lafayette of $530,000. Also, fiduciary activities income increased $255,000 from the third quarter to the fourth quarter.\nThe increase in net income and diluted earnings per share from the fourth quarter of 2016 to the same 2017 period reflects an increase in net interest income of $10.5 million, partially offset by increases in income tax expense of $4.1 million, non-interest expense of $3.7 million, provision for loan losses of $477,000 and average diluted shares outstanding. The majority of the increase in income tax expense was due to the $2.4 million adjustment of Horizon’s net deferred tax assets to the new corporate tax rate. Gains on the sale of investment securities decreased $961,000 from the fourth quarter of 2016 to the same period in 2017, partially offset by the gain on the accounting for Horizon’s previous equity interest in Lafayette of $530,000.\nNet income for the year ended December 31, 2017 was $33.1 million, or $1.43 diluted earnings per share, compared to $23.9 million, or $1.19 diluted earnings per share, for the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase in net income and diluted earnings per share from 2016 to 2017 reflects an increase in net interest income of $26.1 million offset by a decrease in non-interest income of $2.3 million and increases in non-interest expense of $7.9 million, income tax expense of $6.0 million and provision for loan losses of $628,000. Core net income for the year ended December 31, 2017 was $35.5 million, or $1.53 diluted earnings per share, compared to $29.2 million, or $1.45 diluted earnings per share, for the year ended December 31, 2016.\nNon-GAAP Reconciliation of Net Income and Diluted Earnings per Share (Dollars in Thousands Except per Share Data) Three Months Ended Twelve Months Ended December 31 December 31 Non-GAAP Reconciliation of Net Income 2017 2016 2017 2016 (Unaudited) (Unaudited) Net income as reported $ 7,650 $ 5,603 $ 33,117 $ 23,912 Merger expenses 1,444 1,354 3,656 6,827 Tax effect (418 ) (416 ) (1,003 ) (1,998 ) Net income excluding merger expenses 8,676 6,541 35,770 28,741 Gain on sale of investment securities - (961 ) (38 ) (1,836 ) Tax effect - 336 13 643 Net income excluding gain on sale of investment securities 8,676 5,916 35,745 27,548 Prepayment penalties on borrowings - 4,839 - 4,839 Tax effect - (1,694 ) - (1,694 ) Net income excluding prepayment penalties on borrowings 8,676 9,061 35,745 30,693 Gain on remeasurement of equity interest in Lafayette (530 ) - (530 ) - Tax effect 78 - 78 - Net income excluding gain on remeasurement of equity interest in Lafayette 8,224 9,061 35,293 30,693 Tax reform bill impact 2,426 - 2,426 - Net income excluding tax reform bill impact 10,650 9,061 37,719 30,693 Acquisition-related purchase accounting adjustments (\"PAUs\") (868 ) (900 ) (3,484 ) (2,304 ) Tax effect 304 315 1,219 807 Net income excluding (PAUs) $ 10,086 $ 8,476 $ 35,454 $ 29,196 Non-GAAP Reconciliation of Diluted Earnings per Share Diluted earnings per share as reported $ 0.30 $ 0.25 $ 1.43 $ 1.19 Merger expenses 0.06 0.06 0.16 0.34 Tax effect (0.02 ) (0.02 ) (0.04 ) (0.10 ) Diluted earnings per share excluding merger expenses 0.34 0.29 1.55 1.43 Gain on sale of investment securities - (0.04 ) - (0.09 ) Tax effect - 0.02 - 0.03 Diluted earnings per share excluding gain on sale of investment securities 0.34 0.27 1.55 1.37 Prepayment penalties on borrowings - 0.22 - 0.24 Tax effect - (0.08 ) - (0.08 ) Diluted earnings per share excluding prepayment penalties on borrowings 0.34 0.41 1.55 1.53 Gain on remeasurement of equity interest in Lafayette (0.02 ) - (0.02 ) - Tax effect - - - - Diluted earnings per share excluding gain on remeasurement of equity interest in Lafayette 0.32 0.41 1.53 1.53 Tax reform bill impact 0.10 - 0.10 - Diluted earnings per share excluding tax reform bill impact 0.42 0.41 1.63 1.53 Acquisition-related PAUs (0.03 ) (0.04 ) (0.15 ) (0.11 ) Tax effect 0.01 0.01 0.05 0.03 Diluted earnings per share excluding PAUs $ 0.40 $ 0.38 $ 1.53 $ 1.45\nHorizon’s net interest margin remained at 3.71% for the fourth quarter of 2017 when compared to the prior quarter and increased from 2.92% for the fourth quarter of 2016. The increase in net interest margin reflects a decrease in the cost of interest-bearing liabilities of 66 basis points and an increase in the yield of interest-earning assets of 25 basis points. The decrease in the cost of interest-bearing liabilities was primarily due to prepayment penalties incurred on high fixed-rate borrowings as part of Horizon’s balance sheet restructuring transaction in the fourth quarter of 2016. The increase in the yield of interest-earning assets was due to an increase in the yield on taxable investment securities and loans receivable of 28 and 6 basis points, respectively. Excluding prepayment penalties on borrowings and acquisition-related purchase accounting adjustments (“core net interest margin”), the margin was 3.61% for the fourth quarter of 2017 compared to 3.63% for the prior quarter and 3.45% for the fourth quarter of 2016. Interest expense from the prepayment penalties on borrowings was $4.8 million during the three months ended December 31, 2016. Interest income from acquisition-related purchase accounting adjustments was $868,000, $661,000 and $900,000 for the three months ended December 31, 2017, September 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016, respectively.\nHorizon’s net interest margin increased to 3.75% for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to 3.29% for the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase in net interest margin reflects a decrease in the cost of interest-bearing liabilities of 26 basis points and an increase in the yield of interest-earning assets of 24 basis points. The decrease in the cost of interest-bearing liabilities was primarily due to Horizon’s balance sheet restructuring transaction completed in the fourth quarter of 2016 resulting in a decrease of 116 basis points in the cost of borrowings when comparing 2017 to 2016. The increase in the yield on interest-earning assets was due to a 12 basis point increase in the yield on loans receivable and an 11 basis point increase on taxable investment securities. Core net interest margin increased to 3.64% for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to 3.38% for the year ended December 31, 2016. Interest expense from the prepayment penalties on borrowings was $4.8 million during 2016. Interest income from acquisition-related purchase accounting adjustments was $3.5 million and $2.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.\nNon-GAAP Reconciliation of Net Interest Margin (Dollars in Thousands, Unaudited) Three Months Ended Twelve Months Ended December 31 September 30 December 31 December 31\nNet Interest Margin As Reported 2017 2017 2016 2017 2016 Net interest income $ 31,455 $ 27,879 $ 20,939 $ 112,100 $ 85,992 Average interest-earning assets 3,471,169 3,078,611 2,932,145 3,074,464 2,683,383 Net interest income as a percent of average interest- earning assets (\"Net Interest Margin\") 3.71 % 3.71 % 2.92 % 3.75 % 3.29 % Impact of Prepayment Penalties on Borrowings Interest expense from prepayment penalties on borrowings $ - $ - $ 4,839 $ - $ 4,839 Impact of Acquisitions Interest income from acquisition-related purchase accounting adjustments $ (868 ) $ (661 ) $ (900 ) $ (3,484 ) $ (2,304 ) Excluding Impact of Prepayment Penalties and Acquisitions Net interest income $ 30,587 $ 27,218 $ 24,878 $ 108,616 $ 88,527 Average interest-earning assets 3,471,169 3,078,611 2,932,145 3,074,464 2,683,383 Core Net Interest Margin 3.61 % 3.63 % 3.45 % 3.64 % 3.38 %\nLending Activity\nTotal loans increased $405.6 million from $2.429 billion as of September 30, 2017 to $2.835 billion as of December 31, 2017 as commercial loans increased by $344.1 million, residential mortgage loans increased by $35.7 million and consumer loans increased by $27.4 million.

The provision for loan losses totaled $2.5 million and $1.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.

Excluding merger-related expenses of $1.4 million and $2.0 million during the three months ended December 31, 2017 and September 30, 2017, respectively, total non-interest expense increased $2.3 million, or 10.4%. The increase was primarily due to an increase in salaries and employee benefits of $1.4 million due to additional compensation expenses related to performance based incentive plans and the recent Wolverine acquisition. Other expense increased $338,000 reflecting overall company growth, market expansion and recent acquisitions. Outside services and consultant expense decreased $447,000 due to a lower amount of merger-related expenses incurred during the fourth quarter of 2017 when compared to the previous quarter. In addition, the cost savings anticipated from the Lafayette and Wolverine acquisitions were not yet fully realized during the fourth quarter of 2017. We expect the cost savings from these acquisitions will start to be fully realized in the first quarter of 2018.\nTotal non-interest expense was $3.7 million higher in the fourth quarter of 2017 compared to the same period of 2016. Excluding merger-related expenses of $1.4 million recorded in both quarters ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, total non-interest expense increased $3.6 million, or 17.0%. The increase was primarily due to an increase in salaries and employee benefits of $2.9 million, other expenses of $390,000, net occupancy expenses of $176,000, outside services and consultants expense of $147,000 and professional fees of $131,000. The increase in salaries and employee benefits reflects additional compensation expense related to performance based incentive plans, overall company growth and recent acquisitions. Other expenses and net occupancy expenses increased as a result of market expansions and acquisitions. The increase in outside services and consultants expense and professional fees was due to a higher amount of merger-related expenses during the fourth quarter of 2017 when compared to the same period of 2016. Finally, the cost savings anticipated from the Lafayette and Wolverine acquisitions were not yet fully realized during the fourth quarter of 2017. We expect the cost savings from these acquisitions will start to be fully realized in the first quarter of 2018.\nTotal non-interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2017 increased $7.9 million when compared to the year ended December 31, 2016. Excluding merger-related expenses of $3.7 million and $6.8 million recorded during the year ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively, total non-interest expense increased $11.1 million. The increase was primarily due to increases in salaries and employee benefits of $7.4 million, net occupancy expenses of $1.2 million, other expenses of $1.3 million and data processing expenses of $547,000, partially offset by decreases in outside services and consultants expense of $845,000, loan expense of $612,000, FDIC insurance expense of $513,000, other losses of $316,000 and professional fees of $262,000. The increase in salaries and employee benefits expense reflects additional compensation expense related to performance based incentive plans, overall company growth and recent acquisitions. Net occupancy expenses, other expenses and data processing expenses increased primarily due to overall company growth, market expansions and acquisitions. Outside services and consultants expense and professional fees decreased due to a lower amount of merger-related expenses in 2017 compared to 2016. The decrease in loan expense reflects a decrease in loan collection expenses when comparing 2017 to 2016. The reduced assessment rate schedule implemented by the FDIC in the fourth quarter of 2016 resulted in the decrease of FDIC insurance expense in 2017. Other losses decreased primarily due to lower debit card fraud-related expenses in 2017.\nIncome tax expense totaled $5.8 million for the fourth quarter of 2017, an increase of $3.3 million and $4.1 million when compared to the third quarter of 2017 and fourth quarter of 2016, respectively. The increase was primarily due to the impact of the new corporate tax rate which was signed into law at the end of 2017. An adjustment to Horizon’s net deferred tax asset of $2.4 million ($1.7 million of net deferred tax assets and $766,000 of net deferred tax assets related to accumulated other comprehensive income) was recorded to income tax expense during the fourth quarter of 2017 to reflect the new corporate tax rate. Also reflected in this increase in income tax expense is an increase of $2.7 million and $6.2 million in income before income taxes when comparing the fourth quarter of 2017 to the previous quarter and the fourth quarter of 2016, respectively.\nIncome tax expense increased $6.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016. The majority of this increase was due to an increase in income before taxes of $15.2 million during 2017. Also reflected in this increase is the adjustment to Horizon’s net deferred tax asset of $2.4 million recorded during the fourth quarter of 2017.\nUse of Non-GAAP Financial Measures\nCertain information set forth in this press release refers to financial measures determined by methods other than in accordance with GAAP. Specifically, we have included non-GAAP financial measures relating to net income, diluted earnings per share, net interest margin, total loans and loan growth, the allowance for loan and lease losses, tangible stockholders’ equity, tangible book value per share and the return on average assets. In each case, we have identified special circumstances that we consider to be non-recurring and have excluded them, to show the impact of such events as acquisition-related purchase accounting adjustments, prepayment penalties on borrowings and the tax reform bill, among others we have identified in our reconciliations. Horizon believes that these non-GAAP financial measures are helpful to investors and provide a greater understanding of our business without giving effect to the purchase accounting impacts and one-time costs of acquisitions and non-core items. These measures are not necessarily comparable to similar measures that may be presented by other companies and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the related GAAP measure. See the tables and other information below and contained elsewhere in this press release for reconciliations of the non-GAAP figures identified herein and their most comparable GAAP measures.\nNon-GAAP Reconciliation of Tangible Stockholders' Equity and Tangible Book Value per Share (Dollars in Thousands Except per Share Data, Unaudited) December 31 September 30 June 30 March 31 December 31 2017 2017 2017 2017 2016 Total stockholders' equity $ 457,078 $ 392,055 $ 357,259 $ 348,575 $ 340,855 Less: Intangible assets 132,282 103,244 86,726 87,094 86,307 Total tangible stockholders' equity $ 324,796 $ 288,811 $ 270,533 $ 261,481 $ 254,548 Common shares outstanding 25,529,819 23,325,459 22,176,465 22,176,465 22,171,596 Tangible book value per common share $ 12.72 $ 12.38 $ 12.20 $ 11.79 $ 11.48\nNon-GAAP Reconciliation of Return on Average Assets (Dollars in Thousands, Unaudited) Three Months Ended Twelve Months Ended December 31 December 31 Non-GAAP Reconciliation of Net Income 2017 2016 2017 2016 Average Assets $ 3,841,551 $ 3,241,750 $ 3,396,873 $ 2,961,622 Net income as reported 7,650 5,603 33,117 23,912 Merger expenses 1,444 1,354 3,656 6,827 Tax effect (418 ) (416 ) (1,003 ) (1,998 ) Net income excluding merger expenses 8,676 6,541 35,770 28,741 Gain on sale of investment securities - (961 ) (38 ) (1,836 ) Tax effect - 336 13 643 Net income excluding gain on sale of investment securities 8,676 5,916 35,745 27,548 Prepayment penalties on borrowings - 4,839 - 4,839 Tax effect - (1,694 ) - (1,694 ) Net income excluding prepayment penalties on borrowings 8,676 9,061 35,745 30,693 Gain on remeasurement of equity interest in Lafayette (530 ) - (530 ) - Tax effect 78 - 78 - Net income excluding gain on remeasurement of equity interest in Lafayette 8,224 9,061 35,293 30,693 Tax reform bill impact 2,426 - 2,426 - Net income excluding tax reform bill impact 10,650 9,061 37,719 30,693 Acquisition-related purchase accounting adjustments (PAUs) (868 ) (900 ) (3,484 ) (2,304 ) Tax effect 304 315 1,219 807 Net income excluding PAUs $ 10,086 $ 8,476 $ 35,454 $ 29,196 Non-GAAP Reconciliation of Return on Average Assets Return on average assets as reported 0.79 % 0.69 % 0.97 % 0.81 % Merger expenses 0.15 % 0.17 % 0.11 % 0.23 % Tax effect -0.04 % -0.05 % -0.03 % -0.07 % Return on average assets excluding merger expenses 0.90 % 0.81 % 1.05 % 0.97 % Gain on sale of investment securities 0.00 % -0.12 % 0.00 % -0.06 % Tax effect 0.00 % 0.04 % 0.00 % 0.02 % Return on average assets excluding gain on sale of investment securities 0.90 % 0.73 % 1.05 % 0.93 % Prepayment penalties on borrowings 0.00 % 0.60 % 0.00 % 0.17 % Tax effect 0.00 % -0.21 % 0.00 % -0.06 % Return on average assets excluding prepayment penalties on borrowings 0.90 % 1.12 % 1.05 % 1.04 % Gain on remeasurement of equity interest in Lafayette -0.05 % 0.00 % -0.02 % 0.00 % Tax effect 0.01 % 0.00 % 0.00 % 0.00 % Return on average assets excluding gain on remeasurement of equity interest in Lafayette 0.86 % 1.12 % 1.03 % 1.04 % Tax reform bill impact 0.25 % 0.00 % 0.07 % 0.00 % Return on average assets excluding tax reform bill impact 1.11 % 1.12 % 1.10 % 1.04 % Acquisition-related PAUs -0.09 % -0.11 % -0.10 % -0.08 % Tax effect 0.03 % 0.04 % 0.04 % 0.03 % Return on average assets excluding PAUs 1.05 % 1.05 % 1.04 % 0.99 %\nAbout Horizon\nHorizon Bancorp is an independent, commercial bank holding company serving northern and central Indiana, and southern, central and the Great Lakes Bay regions of Michigan through its commercial banking subsidiary Horizon Bank.
