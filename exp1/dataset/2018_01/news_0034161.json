This represents a $452,000, or 87%, increase over the fourth quarter of 2016. Net income available to common shareholders for 2017 was $3,394,000, or $1.43 per share. This represents an increase of $494,000, or 17%, over 2016. Book value per common share climbed to $16.21 at December 31, 2017.\n\"We are proud to report another year of record profitability,\" stated Eugene J. Draganosky, President and Chief Executive Officer. \"Earnings were tempered by the recognition of additional income tax of $137,000 in the fourth quarter to adjust our net deferred tax assets under the recently passed Tax Cut and Jobs Act. Going forward, the reduction in the corporate tax rate will have a favorable impact on net earnings, thereby preserving capital in support of future growth opportunities. Net interest income grew $1,983,000, or 17%, as a result of strong loan and deposit demand. For the year, loans grew $43,256,000, or 14%, while deposits grew $40,772,000, or 13%. We had another excellent year of gains on sale of mortgages, which totaled $4,110,000, down slightly from our record year in 2016. Net loan charge-offs were $30,000 in 2017 and non-performing assets were 0.64% of total assets at year-end. Boosted by a late third quarter capital offering, our Tier 1 capital ratio of 10.89% will support further growth as we continue taking advantage of opportunities in our market.\"\nIn December 2017, York Traditions Bank received regulatory approval for its sixth retail location, the first in York City. Leasehold renovations of this historic building on the corner of West Philadelphia Street and North George Street will begin soon. The office is slated to open mid-year in 2018.\nFINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS (unaudited):\n(Dollars in thousands, except per share data)\nSelected Financial Data\nDec 31,\n2017\nDec 31,\n2016\nInvestment securities\n$\n55,258\n$\n50,185\nLoans, net of unearned income\n348,533\n305,277\nTotal assets\n441,289\n396,716\nDeposits\n363,089\n322,317\nBorrowings\n26,224\n35,710\nSubordinated debt\n5,000\n5,000\nShareholders' equity\n45,319\n32,223\nBook value per common share\n$\n16.21\n$\n14.86\nAllowance/loans\n1.02%\n1.02%\nNon-performing assets/total assets\n0.64%\n0.81%\nTier 1 capital/average assets\n10.89%\n8.21%\nThree months ended Dec 31,\nTwelve months ended Dec 31,\nSelected Operations Data\n2017\n2016\n2017\n2016\nInterest income\n$\n4,521\n$\n3,798\n$\n16,806\n$\n14,472\nInterest expense\n(805)\n(688)\n(3,066)\n(2,715)\nNet interest income\n3,716\n3,110\n13,740\n11,757\nProvision for loan losses\n(50)\n(300)\n(473)\n(994)\nInvestment securities gains\n-\n-\n1\n72\nGains on sale of mortgages\n859\n688\n4,110\n4,249\nOther income\n367\n483\n1,334\n1,602\nOther expense\n(3,310)\n(3,261)\n(13,672)\n(12,558)\nIncome before income taxes\n1,582\n720\n5,040\n4,128\nIncome taxes\n(612)\n(202)\n(1,646)\n(1,228)\nNet income\n$\n970\n$\n518\n$\n3,394\n$\n2,900\nEarnings per common share (basic)\n$\n0.35\n$\n0.24\n$\n1.44\n$\n1.33\nEarnings per common share (diluted)\n$\n0.34\n$\n0.24\n$\n1.43\n$\n1.33\nReturn on average assets\n0.88%\n0.52%\n0.81%\n0.77%\nReturn on average equity\n8.47%\n6.30%\n9.20%\n9.44%\nNet interest margin\n3.56%\n3.32%\n3.49%\n3.31%\nNet charge-offs(recoveries)/average loans\n0.00%\n-0.04%\n0.01%\n0.10%\nSafe Harbor Statement:\nExcept for historical information contained herein, the matters discussed in this release are forward-looking statements.
