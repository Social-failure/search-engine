Christian Dior ( DIOR.PA ) and Kering ( PRTP.PA ) were both among the top five gainers on the STOXX, up 4.2 and 3 percent respectively. \nAccording to Thomson Reuters data 80 percent of the MSCI Europe companies that have reported so fat have beaten fourth-quarter earning expectations and 12 percent have missed them. \nTemenos ( TEMN.S ) was the biggest gainer in Europe, up 6 percent. The Swiss software firm, which is subject to regular takeover speculation, jumped as much as 18 percent on Thursday. \nKepler Cheuvreux raised its price target on Temenos on Friday, pointing to positive comments by Nordic bank Nordea regarding the integration of a Temenos banking platform. Kepler said takeover speculation had also pushed up Temenos shares. A Temenos spokesman could not be reached for comment on Thursday. \nAmong other gainers were Telia ( TELIA.ST ), up 2.2 percent, after the telecom operator lifted its dividend, while shares in Michelin ( MICP.PA ) and Thales ( TCFP.PA ) were buoyed by upbeat broker comments. \nA disappointing update however sent Norwegian insurer Gjensidige ( GJFS.OL ) down 5.8 percent. The company posted below-forecast profits for the fourth quarter and proposed a lower-than-expected full-year dividend. \nSpeciality baker Aryzta ( ARYN.S ) fell 7.1 percent as some brokers downgraded the stock following a profit warning that wiped out one fifth of its market value on Thursday.
