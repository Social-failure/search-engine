The euro EUR= was down 0.14 percent to $1.222.\nEuropean shares closed higher as confidence grew about corporate earnings and the strength of the global economy. The euro zone’s STOXX .STOXXE benchmark index closed up 0.73 percent at 402.95 points, its highest level in 10 years and the pan-regional STOXX 600 benchmark rose 0.5 percent to 400.71 points, a 2-1/2 year peak.\nThe pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index .FTEU3 rose 0.49 percent, also a 2-1/2 year high, and MSCI's gauge of stocks across the globe .MIWD PUS gained 0.46 percent.
