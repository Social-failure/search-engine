Here a revolution is impossible, but we are ensuring evolutionary change,” Tchorzewski told an industry Powerpoll conference.\nIt remains unclear, however, what could replace coal in Poland in the coming decades. Tchorzewski is a supporter of a nuclear power plant, but for the project to take off, a government decision is necessary.\nPoland’s state-run PGE, Poland’s biggest power producer, has been responsible for the project.\nIt was expected to be taken last year, but as works on the financing of the nuclear power plant continue, there seems to be another delay.\n“I think that in the nearest future there will be an answer to the challenge which I consider indispensable - whether or not the construction of nuclear power plant units will start,” Tchorzewski also said.\n“These are the decisions to be taken this year, definitely in the first half of it,” he added.\nThe energy ministry is also looking at possibilities to deploy high temperature gas-cooled reactors (HTGR) in the future.\nReporting by Agnieszka Barteczko; Editing by Lidia Kelly and David Evans\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-29T16:02:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-29T16:21:48.015+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
