(OTC:NBCT) (the “Company”), the holding company of Inland Northwest Bank (the “Bank” or “INB”), today reported financial results for the quarter and year ended December 31, 2017.\nNet income for the fourth quarter of 2017 was $1.15 million, compared to $0.96 million for the previous quarter and $1.41 million for the fourth quarter of 2016. Earnings per diluted share increased from $0.13 for the third quarter of 2017, to $0.15 for the fourth quarter of 2017, and are down $0.06 from the fourth quarter of last year. For the year ended December 31, 2017, net income was $4.13 million, compared to $5.07 million for the in the year ended December 31, 2016, representing a decrease of $0.94 million, or 18.6%. Earnings per diluted share decreased 24.4% year over year, from $0.78 in 2016 to $0.59 in 2017. Earnings for the quarter and year ended December 31, 2017 were negatively impacted by the following nonrecurring expenses:\nOn December 22, 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “Tax Act”) was signed into law. Among other items, the Tax Act reduced the federal corporate tax rate to 21% from the existing maximum rate of 35%, effective for tax years including or commencing January 1, 2018. Generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (“GAAP”) require companies to revalue their deferred tax assets and liabilities with the resulting tax effects accounted for in the reporting period of enactment. Accordingly, the Company recorded related incremental income tax expense of $418 thousand in the fourth quarter of 2017 to revalue its net deferred tax asset. Nonrecurring costs associated with the acquisition of CenterPointe Community Bank (“CenterPointe”) were $262 thousand, net of tax, for the fourth quarter. Acquisition-related costs totaled $1.4 million and $299 thousand, net of tax, for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. During the fourth quarter, the Company converted its core processing system from an in-house to an outsourced environment, which resulted in one-time costs totaling $225 thousand, net of tax.\nThese nonrecurring expenses totaled $905 thousand and $2.1 million, net of tax, for the quarter and year ended December 31, 2017, which compares to nonrecurring expenses totaling $(15) thousand and $299 thousand for the comparable periods in 2016. Quarterly core earnings (non-GAAP), which exclude these nonrecurring costs, were up $170 thousand and $0.02 per diluted share compared to the previous quarter and up $660 thousand and $0.07 per diluted share compared to the fourth quarter of last year. Compared to 2016, core earnings for 2017 were up $813 thousand, or 15.1%, and core earnings per diluted share were up $0.07, or 8.5%.\n2017 Highlights\nSuccessful completion of our second acquisition, CenterPointe Community Bank, on July 14, 2017. Opened 2 de-novo branches in Kennewick and Ephrata. Total revenue for 2017 was $35.4 million, up 19.1% over the previous year. Net interest margin expanded to 4.57% in 2017, compared to 4.41% in 2016. Organic loan growth (excluding loans acquired from CenterPointe) was $95.6 million, or 19.5%. Organic deposit growth was $36.3 million, or 6.6%. Noninterest bearing deposits increased to 34.5% of total deposits, up from 29.9% at the end of 2016. Maintained strong credit quality with nonperforming assets at 0.31% of total assets and net charge-offs totaling 0.02% of average loans for the year. The market price of the Company’s stock increased by $2.15 per share to $12.45 per share, a 20.9% increase during 2017.\nRussell Lee, the Company’s President and CEO, commented, “We reached several important milestones in 2017, including the completion of the CenterPointe acquisition, opening 2 new branches, significant investments in our people and infrastructure, and we surpassed $800 million in total assets.” Mr. Lee continued, “Although our fourth quarter results were significantly impacted by adjustments related to the new tax provisions as well as some one-time expenses, we can see attractive trends for core earnings and revenue growth. The non-GAAP results we are reporting support the Company’s longer term strategic vision.”\nBalance sheet\nAs of December 31, 2017, the Company had total assets of $826.8 million, compared to $827.7 million on September 30, 2017 and $636.5 million on December 31, 2016. Total assets increased $190.2 million, or 29.9%, during 2017, of which $154.8 million is related to the acquisition of CenterPointe.\nThe investment portfolio was $45.6 million as of December 31, 2017, up $15.7 million, or 52.3%, from $30.0 million at December 31, 2016. During the year, the CenterPointe acquisition added $28.0 million to the portfolio, which was partially offset by normal paydowns and maturities. The net unrealized gain in the portfolio decreased from $370 thousand at December 31, 2016, to $160 thousand at December 31, 2017.\nThe net loan portfolio was $682.2 million on December 31, 2017, representing an increase of $4.7 million, or 0.7%, during the fourth quarter of 2017 and an increase of $191.4 million, or 39.0%, from December 31, 2016. Loan growth during the year included organic loan growth of $95.6 million, or 19.5%, combined with $95.8 million acquired from CenterPointe.\nDeposits were $722.6 million at December 31, 2017, compared to $721.7 million on September 30, 2017 and $548.4 million on December 31, 2016. During the year, organic deposit growth totaled $36.3 million, or 6.6%, while the CenterPointe acquisition added $137.9 million to total deposits. Noninterest bearing deposits represented 34.5% of total deposits as of December 31, 2017, compared to 33.3% at September 30, 2017, and to 29.9% at December 31, 2016.\nAsset quality, provision and allowance for loan losses\nAs of December 31, 2017, the Company’s nonperforming assets (“NPAs”) were $2.6 million, representing 0.31% of total assets. NPAs are defined as loans on which the Bank has stopped accruing interest and includes other real estate owned. NPAs at the end of last quarter were $1.9 million, representing 0.23% of total assets, and at December 31, 2016, NPAs were $1.5 million, representing 0.23% of total assets.\nThe Bank had net loan charge-offs of $33 thousand and $125 thousand for the three and twelve-month periods ending on December 31, 2017, compared to net loan charge-offs of $44 thousand and $124 thousand for the comparable periods in 2016. The provision for loan losses was $294 thousand and $1.14 million for the three and twelve-month periods ending on December 31, 2017, compared to $0 and $363 thousand for the comparable periods in 2016. As of December 31, 2017, the allowance for loan losses was $7.3 million, or 1.05% of gross loans, compared to 1.02% for the previous quarter and 1.26% for the comparable period in 2016. Gross loans include those loans acquired through acquisitions of other banks (“purchased loans”), which are recorded at fair value, net of credit-related discounts. The allowance for loan losses as a percent of gross loans, excluding purchased loans, was 1.28% as of December 31, 2017, compared to 1.29% for the previous quarter and 1.37% for the comparable period in 2016.\nCapital\nShareholders’ equity increased $13.8 million, or 20.9%, during 2017. The increase primarily reflects 2017 earnings for the Company and the issuance of 783,142 shares of the Company’s common stock as partial consideration for the acquisition of CenterPointe. During 2017, book value per share of the Company’s common stock increased $0.75, or 7.3%, and tangible book value per share (non-GAAP) increased $0.22 per share, or 2.4%.\nThe Bank continues to maintain capital levels in excess of the requirements to be categorized as “well-capitalized” under regulatory standards. As of December 31, 2017, the Bank’s Tier 1 leverage capital to average assets ratio was 9.5%, its common equity Tier 1 (“CET1”) capital ratio was 10.1%, and its total capital to risk-weighted assets ratio was 11.1%. The regulatory requirements to be considered “well-capitalized” for these three ratios are 5.0%, 6.5%, and 10.0%, respectively.\nTotal revenue\nTotal revenue was $10.6 million for the fourth quarter of 2017, representing an increase of $645 thousand, or 6.5%, from the previous quarter, and representing an increase of $3.1 million, or 41.7%, over the comparable quarter in 2016. Total revenue was $35.4 million and $29.7 million for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively, which represents an increase of $5.7 million, or 19.1%. Total revenue is defined as net interest income plus noninterest income.\nNet interest income\nNet interest income was $9.2 million for the quarter ended December 31, 2017, an increase of $613 thousand, or 7.1%, from the previous quarter and an increase of $3.0 million, or 48.5%, from the fourth quarter of 2016. Net interest income was $30.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, an increase of $5.3 million, or 21.2%, from the comparable period in 2016.\nThe net interest margin (interest income minus interest expense, divided by average earning assets) was 4.85% for the fourth quarter of 2017, compared to 4.82% for the previous quarter; excluding net purchased loan discount accretion, the net interest margin was 4.72% and 4.66%, respectively. For the year, the net interest margin was 4.57% in 2017 compared to 4.41% in 2016; excluding net purchased loan discount accretion, the net interest margin was 4.45% and 4.21%, respectively.\nNoninterest income\nNoninterest income was $1.4 million during the fourth quarter of 2017, up $32 thousand, or 2.4%, from the previous quarter and up $103 thousand, or 8.2%, from the comparable period in 2016. Noninterest income ended 2017 at $5.1 million, an increase of $395 thousand, or 8.4%, over 2016. This year over year increase in noninterest income was related to higher NSF income, higher debit and credit card interchange income, recoveries on acquired written off loans, as well as additional revenues related to the CenterPointe acquisition.\nNoninterest expense\nNoninterest expense totaled $7.9 million for the fourth quarter of 2017, down $66 thousand, or 0.8%, from the previous quarter. The quarter over quarter decrease is primarily related to a reduction in acquisition-related costs, which was largely offset by increases in all other categories of noninterest expenses. The fourth quarter of 2017 was the first full quarter that included CenterPointe’s operating expenses; CenterPointe added four additional locations to our branch network as well as additional personnel. Also, the following nonrecurring expenses totaling $1.0 million were included in the fourth quarter 2017 results: $392 thousand in acquisition-related costs; $341 thousand in expense related to converting our core processing system from an in-house to an outsourced environment; $150 thousand to write down the value of a closed branch location; $48 thousand in write downs on obsolete ATMs; and $100 thousand related to a special bonus of $500 per non-executive employee that was awarded as a result of the expected future favorable impact of the Tax Cuts & Jobs Act of 2017.\nNoninterest expense ended 2017 at $27.2 million, an increase of $5.4 million, or 24.7%, over 2016. Nonrecurring expenses in 2017 totaled $2.6 million, which includes $1.9 million in acquisition-related costs in addition to other nonrecurring costs totaling $639 thousand as noted above. Nonrecurring expenses in 2016 totaled $453 thousand and consisted solely of acquisition-related costs. Excluding these nonrecurring costs, noninterest expense was $24.7 million in 2017 compared to $21.4 million in 2016, an increase of $3.3 million, or 15.4%; this increase primarily reflects general increases in operating expenses as well as the inclusion of CenterPointe’s operating expenses.\nKey ratios\nReturn on average assets (“ROA”) for fourth quarter 2017 was 0.55%, compared to 0.49% in the previous quarter and 0.88% in the fourth quarter last year. For the year ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, ROA was 0.57% and 0.82%, respectively. Core ROA (non-GAAP), which excludes certain nonrecurring expenses, was 0.98% and 0.86% for the quarter and year ended December 31, 2017, and 0.87% and 0.87% for the same periods in 2016.\nReturn on average equity (“ROE”) was 5.78% for fourth quarter 2017, compared to 5.22% in the previous quarter and 8.59% for the fourth quarter last year. For the year ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, ROE was 5.74% and 8.00%, respectively. Core ROE (non-GAAP) was 10.35% and 8.59% for the quarter and year ended December 31, 2017, and 8.50% and 8.47% for the same periods in 2016.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nThis news release contains certain financial measures that are not calculated in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (“GAAP”). Management believes these non-GAAP financial measures provide investors with information useful in understanding the Company’s financial performance. Non-GAAP financial measures should not be viewed as substitutes for financial measures determined in accordance with GAAP, nor are they necessarily comparable to non-GAAP financial measures that may be presented by other companies. Reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures appear under the caption “Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Measures” in the accompanying financial tables.\nThe Company utilizes the non-GAAP measure of core earnings in evaluating operating trends. Core earnings excludes nonrecurring items from net income which the Company does not view as related to its normal operations. These items are presented net of tax and include such items as acquisition-related costs, systems conversion costs, and tax expense associated with the enactment of the Tax Act. Acquisition-related costs consist primarily of severance/benefit related expenses, contract termination costs, systems conversion costs and professional fees. The Company uses the non-GAAP measure of tangible book value, which excludes intangible assets from book value as it improves our comparability to other banking organizations that have not engaged in acquisitions that have resulted in the accumulation of goodwill and other intangible assets.\nAbout Northwest Bancorporation, Inc.\nNorthwest Bancorporation, Inc. is the parent company of Inland Northwest Bank, a state-chartered community bank which currently operates 21 offices across Washington, Idaho and Oregon.
