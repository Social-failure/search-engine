Afrin operation has de-facto started in the field. Manbij will follow,” Erdogan said.\nA general view shows the Kurdish city of Afrin, in Aleppo's countryside March 18, 2015. REUTERS/Mahmoud Hebbo/Files Erdogan has repeatedly said he would crush the Syrian Kurdish militia in Afrin, which he views as a security threat to Turkey.\nDirect military action against territory held by Kurdish militia opens a new front in Syria’s civil war and sees Ankara confronting Kurds allied to the United States at a time when Turkey’s relations with Washington are reaching breaking point.\nThe U.S. State Department called on Turkey to focus on the fight against Islamic State militants and described Turkish activity in Afrin as destabilizing.\nDefence Minister Nurettin Canikli said on Friday that Turkey’s operation in the region had started with cross-border shelling, but no troops have gone into Afrin.\nReporting by Ezgi Erkoyun; Editing by Janet Lawrence\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-20T10:23:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-20T10:46:59.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
