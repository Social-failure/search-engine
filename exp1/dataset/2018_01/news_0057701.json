Chalco’s shares fell 5.8 percent on Tuesday.\nArgonaut analysts said Chalco’s fourth quarter profit was likely wiped out after a “stellar” first three quarters by a steep fall in local aluminium prices later in the year.\nChinese aluminium prices plunged almost 20-percent from mid-September to mid-December as investors raised doubts about the effectiveness of the government’s efforts to curb excess production.\nIn December, China’s aluminium production rebounded to its highest since June, as state-owned producers launched new capacity even as Beijing curbed their private rivals, lifting 2017 output to a record.\n$1 = 6.3156 Chinese yuan renminbi $1 = 7.8214 Hong Kong dollars Reporting by Josephine Mason; editing by Richard Pullin\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-01-31T10:54:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-31T16:39:07.011+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
