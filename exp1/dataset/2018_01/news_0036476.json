In fact, most moves happened, BAML said, during the U.S. Fed’s bond-buying from 2009 onwards and when the ECB started an earlier programme of showering banks with unlimited, ultra-cheap funding.\nAnd if the ECB does halt QE later this year, investors know it will coincide with a turn in central Europe’s own interest rates. The move is in fact already underway, as regional growth and inflation tick up in line with the euro zone recovery.\nThe Czech central bank raised rates twice last year and is expected to do as many as three this year. Romania has just delivered its first rate rise in a decade, while Poland could move later this year, followed finally by Hungary in 2019.\nThat should add to the additional interest buyers get on CEE bonds compared with places like Germany as well as boosting real yields - bond interest minus a country’s inflation rate - which are already over 200 basis points higher in Poland than in Germany.\nAt the same time, while higher rates can erode existing investors’ bond returns, the effect can be mitigated for foreign funds if the country’s currency rises more than their own.\nA major part of the last year’s stellar returns from central European debt came from the 12-18 percent jumps by regional currencies against the dollar. The zloty and crown also rose around 5.5 percent versus the euro.\nPotential for more gains this year, albeit to a lesser extent, means many big-name money managers aren’t as negative on CEE debt as they might have been with the ECB move looming. The currencies have mostly kept pace with the euro’s recent surge.\n“Poland, because we like the currency, we are not underweight the bonds, but the Czechs have been hiking so we like being underweight,” said JP Morgan Asset Management portfolio manager Diana Amoa.\n($1 = 0.8173 euros)\n($1 = 3.4094 zlotys)\n(1 euro = 4.1714 zlotys)\n(1 euro = 25.3962 Czech crowns)\n($1 = 20.7570 Czech crowns)\nAdditional reporting by Jason Hovet in Prague, Luiza Ilie in Bucharest and Peto Sandor in Budapest Editing by Jeremy Gaunt\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-23T18:49:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-23T19:09:46.007+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
