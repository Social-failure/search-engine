We all felt that we were in it and could win. \n“We always had the belief even when they 47 for none.” IMPRESSIVE GOOGLY \nPope followed his double-strike by removing Will Jacks for one and then had Banton and Finlay Trenouth both caught by Sangha at slip to leave England reeling on 79-5 at the scheduled lunch break and staring defeat in the face. \nHe finished off the tail after the break and the comparisons to leg-spinning great Shane Warne were immediately being made. \nThe Australian is widely considered to have changed the art of leg-spin as he tortured batsmen worldwide with his control and variations before retiring with 708 test wickets but Pope said he did not feel anything like him. \n“I don’t tend to compare myself to him,” said Pope, whose long unkempt hair would be shorn when he returns home. \n”It is good to look at him and learn. I really would like to put my red-ball cricket up where he was, that’s the aspiration for any leg-spinner really. \n“Comparisons? I don’t really think about them too much.” \nPope’s first-ball dismissal of England skipper Harry Brook with a googly would have pleased Warne, who took to Twitter to compliment a youngster armed with a formidable bag of tricks that also includes sharp leg-breaks and awkward skidders. \n“This is terrific & brings a huge smile to my face. I had the pleasure of meeting this impressive young man in Adelaide a while ago! Was nice to have a bowl with him too - Lloyd give it a rip - well done & congrats! Spin to win my friend,” Warne tweeted.
