The Trump International is an ornate yet staid hotel, where employees run a tight ship and customer satisfaction is key. Under normal circumstance, the hotel never would have cranked up the volume for the Trump speech, but the demand was boisterous.\nAs the time drew near to the State of the Union delivery, anticipation grew.\nThere were the usual suspects in the room: K Street movers and shakers, a small party where a book by former Trump aide Corey Lewandowski was featured, and your basic button-down Republicans who had come to hear the president check all their policy boxes.\nBut that wasn't all: A husky fellow in a Philadelphia Eagles jersey stood not far from a Hispanic businessman. There was an African-American woman in camouflage fatigues and a young couple strutting in \"Make America Great Again\" colors (they didn't stick around long).\nA burdened hotel worker tried to keep reporters at bay and admonished spectators from capturing the moment with their smartphone video recorders.\nThere was no suppressing the mood, though. Attendees joined in with those in the Capitol for virtually every applause line in the speech. The hotel used the Fox News feed, and the hotel attendees roared at one point when Trump asked for bipartisanship and Fox showed Democrats Charles Schumer and Nancy Pelosi, oft-vilified emblems of the Trump resistance.\nThere was an overwhelming sense in the room that Trump ultimately would prevail over his many detractors.\n\"Phenomenal,\" was how Charles Kirk, an up-and-coming Republican and leader of Turning Point USA, described Trump's term so far. \"He is leading the restoration of the belief in American exceptionalism.\"\nKirk, who's been growing his own fame lately, doesn't believe the surveys that show most Americans oppose the president. As he tours the country — 49 states in the past year — he finds just the opposite sentiment.\n\"There's a strong grassroots support for what he's doing,\" Kirk said. \"When the chips are down, he's going to deliver.\"\nJeff Hunt, the leader of the Western Conservative Summit, also sees a strong base of support for Trump that has remained loyal through his first year in office.\n\"On the issues that matter, religious freedom, defunding Planned Parenthood, repealing Obamacare, he's been strong,\" Hunt said. \"We're really impressed with that [job] the president's been doing.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-31T06:05:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-31T06:05:38.002+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
