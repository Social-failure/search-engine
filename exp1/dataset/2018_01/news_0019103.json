I like our team makeup and I am really looking forward to go over there with this bunch of guys.”\nTeam USA will begin play in the Olympic Games on Feb. 14 against Slovenia in preliminary-round action.\nReporting by Frank Pingue in Toronto, editing by Ed Osmond\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-12T00:15:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-12T00:33:53.019+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
