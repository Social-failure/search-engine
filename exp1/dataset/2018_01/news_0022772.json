JERA Trading Pte Ltd, a trading company based in Singapore, will buy the coal from Cloud Peak.\nSales of the coal are expected to reach 1 million metric tonnes in the final contract year, Cloud Peak said.\nThe deal represents a bit of good news for a U.S. industry that has seen production slip to the lowest level since the late 1970s in the face of a glut of competing low-cost natural gas.\nBackers of coal gasification say the plants burn coal more efficiently than conventional plants, emitting less of the greenhouse gas carbon dioxide.\n“If similar plants were to be built in the U.S. it would go a long way to addressing concerns about carbon dioxide emissions while providing low-cost, reliable electricity,” said Colin Marshall, chief executive and president of Cloud Peak.\nReporting by Timothy Gardner; Editing by Leslie Adler\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-01-17T05:46:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-17T20:00:26.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
