Including the proposed nominees Nestlé has added seven new independent directors in the last three years. The continuous refreshment of the Board augments its diversity and experience and adds new perspectives in the different areas relevant to Nestlé.\nNestlé regularly engages with all its shareholders on topics of corporate governance including its Board's composition. \"The robust director selection process at Nestlé continues to equip the Board with the right blend of capabilities, perspectives, and experiences.
