The company also plans to hire 2,000 new staff and finance their contracts by asking all other employees to work 20 minutes less per day, it added.\nA source close to the company said the main reason for the planned layoffs and new hires was a bid to reduce the average age of its workforce and bring in new ideas to the former state phone monopoly.
