Trump denies making the comment. \nReports of the comment touched a nerve because they come on top of decisions by the Trump administration, particularly on visa restrictions, that many Africans say unfairly penalise the continent. \nAs the summit was being held at ministerial level, the gathering drafted a resolution calling on Trump to “publicly apologise to all Africans”. \nAnything short of that would force them to suspend a cooperation deal signed between Washington and the bloc, said the draft seen by Reuters. \nAfrican leaders are “dismayed and shocked by the increasingly consistent trend by the Trump Administration to denigrate of African descent ... thereby promoting racism, xenophobia and bigotry,” it said. \nBut a Jan. 25 letter sent by Trump prompted a change of tack at presidential level.

REUTERS/Joshua Roberts \nOne summit official said the final resolution that is yet to be released contains no reference to the issue after the leaders concluded the meeting late on Monday. \n“I want to underscore that the United States deeply respects the people of Africa and my commitment to strong and respectful relationships with African states as sovereign states is firm,” Trump said. \nSecretary of State Rex Tillerson would “travel to Africa for an extended visit,” he said. \nThe AU Commission had “taken due note” of the letter, which wished the summit success, Chairperson Moussa Faki Mahamat said during the closing press conference. \nRwanda’s President Paul Kagame, who met Trump last week on the sidelines of the annual World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, said Trump’s reported comment had no impact on the AU summit. \n“When the United States decided to give us Trump as their president we deal with that president of the United States. It is not an issue of whether you appreciate him for this or for that, it is a job that he is doing for his country,” added Kagame, who assumed the African Union’s chairmanship this year. \nHe said both he and Trump had stressed the need for more cooperation.
