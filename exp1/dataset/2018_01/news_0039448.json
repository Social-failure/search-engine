But we need low barriers to trade for all of this to work,” said Mariann Montagne, senior investment analyst and portfolio manager at Gradient Investments.\nThe International Monetary Fund on Monday revised up its forecast for world economic growth to 3.9 percent in 2018 and 2019, saying U.S. tax cuts were likely to boost investment in the world’s largest economy and help its main trading partners.\nShares of Whirlpool rose 2.6 percent and solar companies such as Real Goods Solar, Sunworks and First Solar climbed following the new tariffs.\nAt 12:47 p.m. ET (1747 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 25.03 points, or 0.1 percent, at 26,189.57 and the S&P 500 was up 4.16 points, or 0.15 percent, at 2,837.13.
