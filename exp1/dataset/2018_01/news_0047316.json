I never expected to see our former government leaders depicted like that,” said Voronova, 80, a former pre-school head teacher who remembers seeing Stalin’s body in an open casket at the funeral. \nThe film, the work of Scottish director Armando Iannucci, portrays back-stabbing and infighting among the dictator’s closest allies, as they vie for power immediately after his death. In the backdrop, ordinary Russians suffer the many repressions of that era. \n“I didn’t laugh. There were some funny moments in the film, but I couldn’t laugh, because that was my life,” Voronova said, adding that she was not offended by the film. \n“Why should I be? I have my own opinion. The fact that I didn’t have a childhood, that I didn’t have a youth at all, that’s Stalin’s fault.” \nElla Katz said she attended the funeral when she was in third grade. \n“[The film] is not offensive. How could it be? How? ... The reality was much more terrifying than in this film,” she said.

Staff at the cinema declined to comment on the legality of the screening. \n“Many people of the older generation, and not only, will regard it as an insulting mockery of all the Soviet past, of the country that defeated fascism and of ordinary people, and what’s even worse, even of the victims of Stalinism,” Culture Minister Vladimir Medinsky said in a statement.

He is recognised as responsible for the deaths of millions, from policies that included the forced collectivisation of farms that caused famine, and from a succession of purges that saw mass executions and imprisonment at an archipelago of camps. \nBut Stalin’s leadership during World War Two, when the Red Army beat back a German occupation, is still associated by many Russians with the country’s greatest achievements. \nRussian President Vladimir Putin, running for re-election in March, has called Stalin “a complex figure” and said attempts to demonise him were a ploy to attack Russia.
