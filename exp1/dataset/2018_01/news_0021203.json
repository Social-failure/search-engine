The United States is Poland’s key ally in the light of increased Russian assertiveness.\nPolish tax authorities last year demanded that TVN, TVN24’s parent company, pay 110 million zlotys in allegedly unpaid taxes. TVN is challenging the order.\nPolish media extensively covered last year’s protests in parliament including a blockade of the rostrum by opposition leaders after PiS imposed curbs on media access to the legislature.\nSince winning election in late 2015, the PiS, has been increasingly at loggerheads with the European Union over immigration quotas for EU member states and its placing of courts and media under increased state control.
