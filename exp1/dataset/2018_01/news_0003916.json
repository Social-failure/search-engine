The album, Swift’s first in three years, was kept off streaming for the first three weeks after its release in November.\nBut it was Sheeran whose music dominated radio, digital and streaming in 2017. “Divide” notched up 2.7 million units, including sales and streaming activity, and the 26 year-old singer-songwriter’s single “Shape of You” spent 33 weeks on Billboard’s Hot 100 chart and was streamed one billion times.\nBillboard charts tally units from album sales, song sales (10 songs equal one album) and streaming activity (1,500 streams equal one album).\nVinyl sales surged for a 12th year in a row - up 9 percent in 2017 - especially among older fans. The top selling vinyl albums were The Beatles “Sgt.Pepper’s Lonely Hearts Club Band,” powered by a 50th anniversary reissue, and the British band’s 1969 release, “Abbey Road.”\nReporting by Jill Serjeant\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-04T20:25:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-04T20:37:33.030+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
