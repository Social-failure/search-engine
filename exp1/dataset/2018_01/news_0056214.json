Most Indians travel for education, business or to visit friends and relatives.\nTourism spending by Indians could rise to as much as $40 billion by 2027 from about $16.4 billion in 2016, CAPA said, ranking it sixth in the world ahead of Canada, South Korea and Australia.\n“If there is any market where low-cost, long-haul can work it is India,” CAPA India CEO Kapil Kaul said at an aviation conference in Mumbai on Tuesday, citing its geographic location and a large order pipeline for new long-range narrowbody jets.\nSpiceJet Chairman Ajay Singh said on Tuesday low-cost long haul flights will be introduced as early as this winter.\nIndiGo is exploring long-haul operations and seeking rights to routes, parent InterGlobe Aviation Ltd ( INGL.NS ) told analysts last week.\nAjay Singh, Chairman of Indian low-cost carrier SpiceJet, speaks during the CAPA India Aviation Summit in Mumbai, India January 30, 2018. REUTERS/Danish Siddiqui The low-cost flights would compete against full-service Indian carriers Air India and Jet Airways ( JET.NS ) as well as global rivals such as Emirates [EMIRA.UL] and Lufthansa ( LHAG.DE ).\nBUDGET GROWTH Low-cost carriers, launched in the early 2000s, already dominate domestic air travel with a two-thirds market share.\nThe share of budget airlines in the international market rose to about 23 percent in the fiscal year 2016/17 from 14.5 percent five years earlier, CAPA estimates.\nThat is expected to rise as Indian airlines have placed orders for nearly 800 re-engined aircraft, such as Airbus ( AIR.PA ) A320neos and Boeing Co ( BA.N ) 737 MAX narrowbodies.\nThe jets, with longer ranges than predecessors, will enable low-cost carriers to launch non-stop routes to Asian destinations such as Phuket, Manila, Hong Kong, and Hanoi that are otherwise unviable today.\nBy 2025, Indian budget carriers will operate close to 40 wide-bodied aircraft, which could deliver an additional 2 million annual outbound leisure travelers to places such as New York and Sydney, CAPA said.\nLow-cost carriers AirAsia India and Vistara, a full-service joint venture between Singapore Airlines ( SIAL.SI ) and India’s Tata Group, are expected to launch their first international flights later this year.\nReporting by Aditi Shah, Editing by Jamie Freed and Biju Dwarakanath\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-31T01:05:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-31T01:09:04.014+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
