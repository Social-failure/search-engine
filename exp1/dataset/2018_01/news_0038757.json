The midpoint of that range came in slightly below analysts’ average estimate of $7.00 per share.\nIts sales forecast of $62.5 billion to $64.0 billion, while analysts’ were expecting $63.08 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.\nThe company’s shares, up 23.3 percent in the past 12 months, were little changed at $135.75 in premarket trading.\nChief Financial Officer Akhil Johri told Reuters on Wednesday that the company expects to quickly repatriate $2 billion in overseas cash under the new U.S. tax law.\nThe latest quarter included a 90-cent charge related to the new U.S. tax law. UTC expects to make net cash payment of $1.5 billion through 2026, and use the tax windfall partly to reduce borrowing for its acquisition of Rockwell Collins ( COL.N ).\nFor the fourth quarter, net sales rose 7 percent to $15.68 billion, topping Wall Street’s expectation of $15.40 billion.\nThe company’s income from continuing operations attributable to common share owners fell to $397 million, or 50 cents per share in the fourth quarter ended Dec. 31, from $1.01 billion, or $1.26 per share, a year earlier.\nOn an adjusted basis, UTC earned $1.60 per share, higher than the $1.56 per share expected by analysts.\nRelated Coverage United Tech to quickly repatriate $2 bln under new tax law: CFO Reporting by Ankit Ajmera in Bengaluru and Alwyn Scott in New York; Editing by Saumyadeb Chakrabarty\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-24T13:19:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-24T13:32:05.029+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
