The country has the world’s largest proven oil reserves but suffers inflation and food shortages.\nThe European Union imposed an arms embargo in November.\nExperts say U.S. sanctions, while providing strong symbolism, have had little or no impact on Maduro’s policies so far and that oil-sector and financial sanctions may be the only way to force the Venezuelan government to change.\nOil and related products make up three quarters of Venezuela’s exports to the EU, but there has been no discussion of imposing an oil embargo, diplomats said.\nThere was no immediate reaction from the Maduro government, although he has regularly accused the EU of joining forces with Washington to denigrate and topple socialist rule in Venezuela via false accusations and support for coup plotters.\nMADURO‘S ENFORCER\nTwo EU diplomats said those likely to be targeted with sanctions were senior officials in charge of security forces accused of widespread abuses, particularly during anti-government protests last year.\nThe list could still change, the diplomats said, but at present those likely to be hit with the travel bans and asset freezes include Antonio Jose Benavides Torres, chief of the Capital District in Caracas; Interior Minister Nestor Riverol; National Intelligence Director Gustavo Gonzalez Lopez; and Chief Justice Maikel Moreno, who heads the Supreme Court.\nMoreno is seen as Maduro’s legal enforcer. Last year his court gave the green light for Maduro to proceed with an election that created the Constituent Assembly, a legislature that now supersedes the opposition-led parliament and cemented Maduro’s rule.\nAt least 125 people died in four months of protests that ensued after the court sought in March to neuter parliament.\nHowever, unlike the United States and Canada, the EU does not intend to sanction Maduro himself, seeking instead to put pressure on those around him but allow the president the option to travel for any future talks.\nIf agreed by Brussels ambassadors from the 28 EU nations on Thursday, the sanctions would likely be adopted and imposed some time next week, diplomats said.
