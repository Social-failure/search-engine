They shouldn’t: The overall payout should now be larger than expected. The buyback plan alone, before further dividend growth, provides a greater total payout than the previous consensus forecasts for dividend growth would have paid.\nUBS had more of a near-death experience than some European rivals during the crisis, but as a consequence was forced into a major restructuring straightaway, while rivals like Credit Suisse or Deutsche Bank attempted to get by with more limited business changes. As a result, UBS returned to health much more rapidly while those rivals are still dealing with questions about the size and scope of their businesses.\nRelated UBS Swings to Quarterly Loss After Hit From U.S. Tax Reform Heard: Banks Dodge a Bullet From Global Capital Fight UBS Chief Executive Sergio Ermotti Photo: leanza/EPA/Shutterstock The bank said clarity on the Basel global banking rules , which were completed at the end of last year, gave it a better view of how much capital it would now need to build over coming years. At the same time, the 2.9 billion Swiss francs of losses related to U.S. tax changes didn’t cut into its capital or dividend paying capacity because they mainly affect intangible, noncash assets on the balance sheet.\nLike U.S. banks, who reported in the past two weeks, UBS saw weak activity in fixed-income trading, but stronger activity in equities. It also saw strong inflows into its wealth management businesses , although margins there were slightly weaker than expected.\nInvestors should be cheered by these results overall. Not only are they getting more money back than expected, but also the buyback plan leaves plenty leftover to address extra regulatory capital demands and growth in UBS’s business. UBS looks to be keeping its nose ahead of its rivals.\nWrite to Paul J.
