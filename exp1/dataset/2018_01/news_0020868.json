We remind (people of) its risks. When the risks occur, the losses will be borne by the public. We are obliged to protect consumers and protect them from a bubble,\" Agusman said by telephone on Saturday.\nAsked whether such statements from authorities could stir panic among those who had already invested in cryptocurrencies, he said: \"They didn't consult with us when buying....please help us make the people understand.\"\nIndonesian authorities have been stepping up their warnings and last month BI issued a regulation banning use of cryptocurrencies by financial technology companies involved in payment systems, and said it is examining whether there's a need to regulate trading on virtual currency exchanges.\nSouth Korean authorities this week sent global bitcoin prices temporarily plummeting and virtual coin markets into turmoil when the justice minister, Park Sang-ki, said regulators were preparing legislation to halt cryptocurrency trading.\nPrices later rebounded on the Luxembourg-based Bitstamp, bitcoin to stand at $14,116 in latest trading after touching $12,800 this week.\nBitcoin.co.id, an Indonesian online cryptocurrency exchange, said on its website that bitcoin was trading at 217.44 million rupiah ($16,288) per unit.\nSome Indonesian merchants, including an online babyware supplier, indicate on their websites that they accept payment in Bitcoin.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-13T10:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-13T10:56:31.035+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
