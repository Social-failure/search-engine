In the first case, the government is claiming damages from Toll Collect and its consortium for the late introduction of the truck toll and for contractual penalties.\nIn the second case, Toll Collect is seeking compensation from the government for operation of the toll system.\nThe Handelsblatt report said that Berlin is still in negotiations with the shareholders in an effort to resolve the disputes and ensure that potential liabilities arising from the cases do not hinder a sale.\nThe ministry spokesman declined to comment further on the matter.\nDaimler and Deutsche Telekom on Tuesday both declined to comment on the report.\nReporting by Michael Nienaber in Berlin and Tom Sims in Frankfurt; Editing by David Goodman\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-01-30T18:19:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-31T16:13:55.021+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
