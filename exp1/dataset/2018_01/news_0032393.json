(1512 GMT) \"Carpetright's update indicates that sales have been weak in big ticket housing-related areas (bed, flooring, sofas) at an important point in the promotional calendar,\" note Stifel analysts. Companies yet to report that are the most exposed to apathetic general and home-related retail spending are DFS Furniture, Dixons Carphone and Kingfisher, they say, adding that macro data has also been pretty downbeat. Northern Trust Capital Markets analysts previously said Carpetright's issues were relatively company-specific, but they reckon the scale of today's warning spells trouble for Kingfisher, whose brands include home improvement chain B&Q. \"Trading updates to come are likely to give further colour on the polarisation of the larger ticket spend following Carpetright's profit warning today, whilst we anticipate that the pure-play apparel operators, following Boohoo's update, will continue to gain share and drive substantial sales growth,\" says Shore Capital head of research Clive Black. Stay tuned next week as clothing retailer N Brown reports on Jan 23, Dixons Carphone reports on Jan 24, and ASOS on Jan 25. DFS Furniture will give its half-year trading update on Feb 8. The FTSE's general retail index is heading for its worst day in more than two months, reflecting the downbeat mood: (Helen Reid) BACKWARDATION SHOULD DRIVE ENERGY STOCKS FORWARD (1400 GMT) The oil market's recent move into 'backwardation' - meaning later-dated crude futures are trading lower than the spot price - is a boon for oil and gas stocks, Morgan Stanley reckons. Europe's energy stocks have on average outperformed by 6 percent per year in periods of backwardation, against a 4.7 percent underperformance during contango, MS analysts find. And the sector is still \"too cheap\", with a massive valuation gap to catch up on. Stocks are pricing in crude \"in the mid 40s\", they calculate - far shy of the $75 the bank targets for Q3. \"If the market moved to price in $60-$70 oil on this basis it would imply the sector generates $50-60 billion of free cash flow and re-rates by c.15-20 percent,\" MS forecasts - and hopes - the bank's got an overweight on the sector. You can track global oil stocks as they progress and (potentially) catch up with crude price gains here: tmsnrt.rs/2DPMJUs (Helen Reid) HALF SESSION UPDATE: EUROPE ON A HIGH (1320 GMT) After a rather subdued start, equities in Europe have clearly moved into positive territory with the pan-regional STOXX 600 benchmark at fresh 2-1/2 year highs and euro zone stocks at a 10 year peak. One supportive factor for the intraday move (and probably the one that \"really matters\" - to use the words tweeted by City Index analyst at Ken Odeluga) is that Wall Street is set for a higher open as investors bet on strong corporate earnings, while playing down fears of a potential U.S. government shutdown. (Danilo Masoni) **** SO GREEK SOVEREIGN BONDS RECOVERED, ARE SHARES NEXT? (1235 GMT) Greek sovereigns bonds have made a spectacular come-back these last two years, with yields falling from over ten percent to below four percent as the country prepares to exit its bail-out program and finance itself on the markets. \"We think that Greek Equities should be next to outperform,\" writes Lyxor, which notes that \"the Athens Stock Exchange (ASE) has underperformed the EuroStoxx300 by 80% since the Eurozone crisis started\". In a nutshell, if Greek shares catch up with their peers the way the country's sovereign bonds have with Euro zone so-called peripherals, the upside is impressive. \"A recovery of the ASE back to its 2014 highs would grant a lofty 50% price return,\" Lyxor adds. Here's the chart showing the catch-up potential: (Julien Ponthus) **** HIGH RISK PREMIA PRESERVE DOMINANCE OF STOCKS OVER BONDS (1208 GMT) With everyone asking themselves how long this New Year's bull run can continue without a significant hiccough, Citi's global strategy team reminds us why stocks remain popular from a cross-asset point of view: a high equity risk premium (ERP). \"Risk premia across global equities still look attractive compared to those in fixed income,\" Citi's Robert Buckland and team write. The high ERP has been part of what's helped stock markets stay relatively unscathed by moves in bond yields. This buffer is \"not exhausted yet\", they reckon, but it is shrinking (see the chart courtesy of Citi below). The ERP remains the highest in Europe where bond yields remain very low, while it is lower in Japan and the U.S. - a divergence Citi strategists recommend playing by going overweight European equities (ex-UK). A falling ERP favours cyclicals, which usually outperform defensives in this environment. \"Financials seem to be the most consistent beneficiary,\" say Buckland and co. Flows data certainly reflects this: financials drew the largest inflows ($1.6 bln) this week, according to EPFR. (Helen Reid) SEARCHING FOR VALUE IN CONSUMER STAPLES (1135 GMT) There's been a lot of buzz around cyclicals in 2018, but what about European defensives? Given that defensives aren't cheap and are facing the threat of rising bond yields, analysts at Liberum prefer consumer staples stocks which offer value, FCF yield and self-help stories. \"While Consumer Staples companies still present relatively resilient, visible earnings growth, constrained top-line growth, intensely competitive end markets and rising inflation provide headwinds to EPS growth. Weak sales growth is forcing companies to drive earnings via aggressive margin expansion,\" Liberum analysts say in a note. Liberum add that they expect the sector to perform in line with the broader market. Their top picks for 2018 include Reckitt Benckiser, Heineken, Danone and Tate & Lyle. (Kit Rees) STOXX 600 - ENJOY THE MOMENTUM WHILE YOU CAN (1121 GMT) The economic momentum which has driven the STOXX 600 up to 400 points is set to fade in the next couple of months, meaning the pan-European index should settle on a downward path, Deutsche Bank reckons. \"Accelerating growth momentum has done wonders for European asset prices over the past 18 months, but we expect this acceleration to start reversing over the coming months,\" Sebastian Raedler, head of European equity strategy at Deutsche Bank just told us. \"We project the fair-value level for the Stoxx 600 declining from around 410 at the moment to around 370 by mid-year\", he said. With December's euro zone manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) at 60.6, the highest since the survey began in June 1997, there isn't much room left for the pace to improve further and DB expects it to decline this month. \"When the Euro area PMI is above 56, PMI momentum is rarely positive over the following six months\", Raedler said, explaining that \"it's not the level of growth that matters for equities, but the rate of change of growth, i.e. whether growth is accelerating or decel", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-19T17:21:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-19T17:46:58.023+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
