Sales of the current Silverado rose nearly 2 percent to 585,000 vehicles in 2017.\nIn the coming months, the company will also reveal a revamped GMC Sierra pickup truck.\nU.S. new vehicle sales fell 2 percent in 2017 after hitting a record high in 2016, and are expected to drop further in 2018 as interest rates rise and more late-model used cars return to dealer lots to compete with new ones.\nGM said on Tuesday that while it retools a factory in Ft. Wayne, Indiana, to make the new pickup trucks, it will shift some production to an Oshawa, Ontario, plant in order to avoid missing sales in a hot market for the vehicles.\nThe No. 1 U.S. automaker said it will record a $7 billion non-cash charge for its fourth-quarter 2017 earnings related to deferred tax assets.\nGM said it expects capital expenditure in 2018 of around $8.5 billion, about $1 billion of which will go towards funding self-driving car technology.\nLast week, the company said it is seeking U.S. government approval for a fully autonomous car - one without a steering wheel, brake pedal or accelerator pedal - to enter the automaker's first commercial ride-sharing fleet in 2019.\nGM said it expects 2017 earnings per share at the high end of its previously forecast range of $6 to $6.50. Analysts have predicted full-year 2017 earnings per share of $6.30.\nThe company expects earnings for 2018 to be roughly the same as in 2017. Analysts have predicted full-year 2018 earnings per share of $5.98.\nIn premarket trading, GM shares were up $1.35, more than 3 percent, at $45.42.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-16T16:50:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-16T17:11:13.001+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
