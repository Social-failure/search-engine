It said this year is meaningful for both North and South Korea as it is the 70th anniversary of the founding of North Korea while South Korea will be hosting the Winter Olympics next month.\nReporting by Christine Kim; Editing by Matthew Mpoke Bigg and Susan Thomas\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-24T23:59:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-25T00:12:21.006+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
