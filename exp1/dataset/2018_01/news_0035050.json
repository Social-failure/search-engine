It fell 35 percent last week, its biggest weekly percentage decline in two years. \n* Average daily earnings for capesizes, which typically transport 150,000-tonne cargoes such as iron ore and coal, fell $113 to $11,458. \n* Among smaller vessels, the supramax index rose 2 points up to 913 points, while the handysize index climbed 1 point to 585 points.
