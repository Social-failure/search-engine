[ECILT/GB]\nGROWTH Britain lagged every other G7 country in terms of growth over the first three quarters of 2017 and has been outpaced by the euro zone ever since the Brexit referendum.\nBusiness surveys suggest it is likely to have matched the quarterly 0.4 percent economic growth it managed between July and September in the final three months.\nThat would give a conservative slant to last month’s Reuters poll forecast of 1.5 percent for 2017 as a whole.\nWith Brexit due in less than 15 months, many think 2018 will be tougher, with the same poll pegging annual average growth for this year at around 1.3 percent.\nThe Bank of England expects the economy will grow by an above-consensus 1.6 percent in 2018, while the Office of Budget Responsibility predicts 1.4 percent.

The BoE and many economists think that will prove to be the peak, giving some relief to households that have seen the value of their earnings eroded by rising prices.\nHelping matters, sterling looks likely to hold around $1.34 to $1.36 through this year, according to a Reuters poll out this week. [GBP/POLL]\nWage growth looks likely to pick up in 2018, although previous forecasts on pay have tended to err on the optimistic side.\nHouse prices are set to extend a slow march higher next year, apart from in London where they are likely to fall.

Britain’s recent export performance is average compared with other European countries.\nThe BoE expects net trade to give a small boost to economic growth in the first half of 2018.\nTo view a graphic on UK factory exports, click: reut.rs/2CVM4Qx\nEMPLOYMENT After a strong run of jobs growth, the number of people in work in Britain fell in the three months to September and in the three months to October.\nMost business surveys suggest job creation is more muted than a couple of years ago but they do not point to a sharp drop in employment intentions.\nTo view a graphic UK employment, click: reut.rs/2CVeGcR\nGraphics by Andy Bruce and Lea Desrayaud; editing by John Stonestreet\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "http://reut.rs/2CuiWPw", "http://reut.rs/2CU4zVD", "http://reut.rs/2CrwkE1", "http://reut.rs/2CVeGcR", "http://reut.rs/2CuovNU", "http://reut.rs/2CsNykA", "http://reut.rs/2CVM4Qx"], "published": "2018-01-05T22:13:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-05T22:26:03.010+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
