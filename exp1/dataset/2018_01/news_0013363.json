Tackling corruption promises to be a key campaign issue, and the PRI faces an uphill struggle to hold on to power.\nAfter noticing the holdup in federal transfers, Corral said, he and aides held a meeting with top ministry officials in Mexico City on the evening of Jan. 4 to discuss the impasse.\nThere, Corral added, the Chihuahua delegation was told that his state’s investigation into alleged corruption had called “into question the mechanism of how funds are transferred,” for which reason the ministry decided to withhold the money.\nProsecutors in Chihuahua accuse Gutierrez of participating in a scheme to divert public funds worth 250 million pesos into PRI coffers during the 2016 election season, in which Cesar Duarte’s successor was chosen. Gutierrez has denied the charge.\nA Mexican judge issued an arrest warrant for Duarte last March. Corral says his predecessor is in the United States.\nNow Chihuahua was being subjected to “political reprisals” for taking on corruption in Mexico, Corral said.
