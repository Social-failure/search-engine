He then got into an argument with his former girlfriend.\nWhen Hall’s then 12-year-old son came to see what was happening, Rayford stabbed the boy in the back and Hall fled for safety, prosecutors said.\nThe boy, who survived, went to a neighbor’s house and the neighbor called police, they said.\nRayford caught Hall, and then beat her to death, dumping her body in a drainage pipe, prosecutors said. Rayford was captured in Hall’s backyard about an hour after police arrived. He was wet and had bloodstains on his clothes, they said.\nRayford had served eight years of his 23-year sentence for killing his wife when he was released on parole in 1994, prison records showed.\nReporting by Jon Herskovitz; Editing by Peter Cooney\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-30T13:01:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-30T13:12:39.027+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
