More than 200,000 children are estimated to suffer from severe acute malnutrition, which can be deadly, the report said. \nCARE has no access to North Korea, where the U.N.’s World Food Programme (WFP) and International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) are among the few agencies to have aid programmes. \nAll but 3 of the 10 crises on the list are African. \nIn order they are: North Korea, Eritrea, Burundi, Sudan, Democratic Republic of Congo, Mali, Vietnam, the Lake Chad Basin, Central African Republic and Peru.
