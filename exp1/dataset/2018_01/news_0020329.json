By far the biggest EU financial centre, London dominates the $5.1-trillion-a-day global foreign exchange market and hosts more banks than any other centre. \n“LOST DECADE” \nBut other EU capitals see Brexit as an opportunity to grab business from London. The EU has already proposed that clearing of euro-denominated derivatives, done mainly in London, could move to the euro zone without a comprehensive Brexit deal. \nA stand-off between Britain and the EU over future access to the single market for London’s financial services industry is shaping up to be one of the key Brexit battlegrounds before Britain is due to leave the bloc in March 2019. \nSince her botched bet on a snap election cost her party its majority in parliament, May has sought to reassure finance chiefs about Brexit, although she cannot give certainty about the future of the post-divorce relationship with the EU. \nShe will meet finance chiefs including Jes Staley, chief executive of Barclays, and Richard Gnodde, chief executive of Goldman Sachs International in Downing Street on Thursday. \nBut financial services companies are reluctant to hire, according to Morgan McKinley. Financial services jobs new to the market in December fell to 3,150 from 4,980 in December 2016, it said. A FAREWELL TO LONDON? \nMany banks, insurers and other financial firms are enacting contingency plans to shift parts of their European operations to the continent because they are likely to lose the right to sell their products freely within the bloc from London. \nThe EU’s chief Brexit negotiator, Michel Barnier, said on Tuesday the EU would not give financial firms based in Britain a general “passport” to do business in the single market. \nBloomberg reported that Germany would demand Britain pay for financial firms to have access to the EU market after Brexit, though EU officials said Britain would not be able to cherry pick its post-Brexit relationship. \nBritish officials, who argue that the EU’s biggest economies would find it hard to function should London be isolated financially, are confident the EU will be flexible. \nBut if Britain insists, as May does, on viewing the Brexit vote as a call for tougher immigration controls, it is unclear how Berlin and Paris could allow London-based financial services companies full access to the EU market for free.
