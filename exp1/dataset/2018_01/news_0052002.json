In 2016, private equity accounted for 6.1 percent of their assets, up from 3.7 percent in 2011.\nSome 63 percent of sovereign funds invested in both real estate and infrastructure in 2016, up from 59 percent in real estate and 60 percent in infrastructure two years earlier.\nPWC suggested that sovereign funds’ presence in the asset classes could have a big impact on prices and development plans in coming years. It noted that high demand and limited supply were making competition for real estate fierce, even in second-tier markets.\n“With mass urbanization and the associated economic growth in emerging regions, and the renewal of dilapidated infrastructure in developed countries, this asset class might play a larger role in the future,” it said.\nThe report also found that total assets under management grew to $7.4 trillion in 2016, albeit at a slower pace, with some funds facing adverse conditions since 2014 because of falling oil prices.\nPWC expects assets under management to grow faster in coming years as the diversification into alternatives enhances returns.\nReporting by Claire Milhench, editing by Larry King\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-30T02:10:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-30T02:29:20.029+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
