Slideshow (16 Images) \nBut the Frenchman twice fired over from close range before unmarked strike partner Kevin Gameiro missed with a header. \nThe Andalusian hosts added to Escudero’s early strike after the break to regain the lead when Banega converted his spot kick after Saul Niguez was adjudged to have fouled Joaquin Correa. \nAtletico forward Angel Correa then missed a gilt-edged chance to level again as Rico thwarted him in a one-on-one situation and was made to pay when Sarabia rounded off the scoring on the counter-attack 10 minutes from time. \nThe 2013 King’s Cup winners Atletico, who trail Liga leaders Barcelona by 11 points, must now turn their attention to the Europa League where they are in the round of 32 after being knocked out of the Champions League at the first hurdle.
