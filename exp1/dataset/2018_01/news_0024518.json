It wants to encourage borrowers to choose fixed-rate housing loans.\nRun by Matolcsy, a strong ally of rightist Prime Minister Viktor Orban, the bank wants to drive borrowing costs lower - even as global central banks and the nearby Czech central bank and Romanian central bank have started tightening.\n“According to our forecast, inflation could reach the 3 percent target in a sustainable way in mid-2019,” Matolcsy said.\n“For this, it is necessary to keep the base rate at a historical low and interbank rates around zero all along, and to curb long-term yields using the NBH’s entire policy toolkit.”\nHe reiterated that the bank had no exchange rate target, and the stability of the forint was an important factor.\nInflation was running at an annual 2.5 percent in November. December data is due on Friday.\nMatolcsy said for the Hungarian economy to keep up its solid growth rates, comprehensive reforms were needed to boost competitiveness.\n“A key element of this must be a further reduction in the personal income tax rate,” he said. Hungary’s personal income tax rate is at 15 percent.\nMatolcsy also said Hungary should adopt the euro only when it is prepared for that, when the gap between the Hungarian economy and the euro zone narrows sufficiently.\n“The crisis of the euro zone clearly showed that meeting the Maastricht criteria in itself is not enough for successful accession (to the euro) and the introduction of the euro is no guarantee for successful catching up (with the euro zone),” he said.\nHe did not mention a possible date for joining the euro zone.
