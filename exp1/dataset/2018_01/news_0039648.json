(Nasdaq: WBA) pursuant to the previously disclosed Amended and Restated Asset Purchase Agreement, dated as of September 18, 2017 (the “Asset Purchase Agreement”). As of January 22, 2018, Rite Aid has transferred 625 stores and related assets to WBA, and has received cash proceeds of $1,309.8 million, which it is using to repay all of its $970 million of outstanding secured loans while maintaining a strong liquidity position. Under the Asset Purchase Agreement, WBA will purchase a total of 1,932 stores, three distribution centers and related inventory from Rite Aid for an all-cash purchase price of $4,375 million on a cash-free, debt-free basis.\n“Our teams continue to make tremendous progress in transferring stores to WBA and I want to thank them for their ongoing commitment and dedication,” said Rite Aid Chairman and CEO John Standley. “We are on track to complete the transfer of stores in the spring of this year. Going forward, we remain focused on the continued smooth execution of that process and capitalizing on our most significant business-building opportunities as we work together to deliver a great experience to our customers and patients, and drive value for our shareholders.”\nThe majority of the closing conditions have been satisfied, and the subsequent transfers of Rite Aid stores and related assets remain subject to minimal customary closing conditions applicable only to the stores being transferred at such subsequent closing, as specified in the Asset Purchase Agreement. Additional details regarding today’s announcement have been filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on Form 8-K.\nRite Aid is one of the nation's leading drugstore chains with fiscal 2017 annual revenues of $32.8 billion.
