REUTERS/Russell Cheyne The village of Kenmore has been the traditional starting place for the Scottish salmon fishing for over 70 years, with the Tay being the first of the scores of river systems on which the season takes place.\nMonday’s event saw dozens of anglers, many sipping glasses of whisky, cast lines in a bid to bag a big fish but, as of late in the afternoon, one participant said that he had seen only one salmon actually caught by anyone - a fact that neither surprised nor bothered him.\n“It’s kinda the highlight of the season. You know you’re coming here not really to catch any fish. At the end of the day you’re coming to savor the atmosphere,” fisherman Leigh Kelly, 36, told Reuters.\n”If you’re gonna catch a few fish, you need to be nearer the sea to get at any, you know? The estuary here is right at the top of the river, so that’s difficult. But it’s good to be on the bank.”\nThe event kicked off with a parade by the Vale of Atholl pipe band, who marched the anglers to the river, which was then blessed with the contents of a quaich - a traditional drinking vessel - of whisky being thrown into the river.\nThe salmon season on the Tay runs from Jan. 15 to Oct. 15. On other Scottish rivers it runs as late as Nov. 30.\nWriting by Mark Hanrahan in London Editing by Jeremy Gaunt\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-15T18:43:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-15T19:09:51.010+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
