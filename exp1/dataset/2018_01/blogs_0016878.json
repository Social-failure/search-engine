California-based robotics start-up FoldiMate hopes the answer to that question is about $1,000.\nFoldiMate is building a home assistant robotics machine to fold laundry. The start-up showcased a prototype at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas this week, but the final product will not ship until late 2019.\nAnd it's expected to cost $980, according to the FoldiMate website .\nIt's the final day of #CES2018 and we have had such an amazing time. Look at all the people who have come by to visit us this week. \n\"I started this journey seven years ago with a humble goal: to help out with laundry folding in my home. After recently trying out one of our early prototypes, my kids started fighting over who will be using FoldiMate when we'll have it in our house,\" says Gal Rozov, the founder and CEO, on the FoldiMate website .\nThe robot will fold shirts , blouses and pants from those fitting a child age five through an adult XXL, FoldiMate says. It will also fold standard towels and pillowcases. It will not fold very small items like baby clothes, socks and underwear, nor will it fold very large or bulky items like sheets or hoodies.\nIt will take the FoldiMate between two and four minutes to fold between 20 and 40 items, which is what the robotics company dubs an average load of laundry.\nThe start-up doesn't have a product yet, but it's already raised $3 million in seed funding from an undisclosed collection of investors, according to a statement published by the company in July .\nThough folding laundry is a near-universally despised chore (who likes folding laundry?!), cleaning the kitchen is the chore most people would like to see a robot take care of, according to former Alphabet Chairman Eric Schmidt .\n\"When you ask a person what they would like a robot to do — the thing that they would like more than anyone else — is clean up the dishes in the kitchen,\" the billionaire former Google executive says speaking at the Halifax International Security Forum in November.\n\"That is literally the number one request. And I say this having done this exhaustively,\" Schmidt says.\nSee also: \nGoogle billionaire Eric Schmidt: People want dish-washing robots to clean up the kitchen more than any other kind \nAlphabet's Eric Schmidt: It can be 'very difficult' for Google's search algorithm to understand truth \nWhat happened when Google made its CEO share an office with one of his engineers \nshow chapters Elon Musk issues yet another warning against runaway artificial intelligence      1:37 PM ET Mon, 17 July 2017 | 01:03 Like this story?
