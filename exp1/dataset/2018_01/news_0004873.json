Public opinion polls have consistently found the mine is strongly opposed by Alaska residents. \nIndigenous communities in particular have criticized the project, though some groups have supported it. \n“The science on such a project is already available, and already clear: this mine will devastate the Bristol Bay fishery,” Robert Heyano, president of the United Tribes of Bristol Bay, said in a statement. \nPebble Limited Partnership Chief Executive Officer Tom Collier, in a statement Friday, said the company has responded to critics by scaling back the mine scope, eliminating planned use of cyanide and making other changes. \n“These are very substantial improvements that we have made over the past few years in response to issues and concerns raised by project stakeholders,” he said.
