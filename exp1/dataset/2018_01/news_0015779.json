The Romanian, who reached the quarter-finals at Melbourne Park in 2014 and 2015, now has the chance to win her maiden grand slam title and assert her dominance after first-round exits in the last two editions.\nElina Svitolina (Ukraine)\nWorld ranking: 4\nBorn: Sept. 12, 1994 (Age 23)\nHeight: 1.74 metres\nPlays: Right-handed\nGrand slam titles: 0\nWTA match record in 2018 (won-lost): 5-0\nSvitolina won five singles titles last season and has started the current campaign in fine form by winning her 10th career title at the Brisbane International, dropping just one set in the process. The Ukrainian has not fared well at grand slams and will be eager to get past the third round at Melbourne Park for the first time.\nVenus Williams (U.S.)\nWorld ranking: 5\nBorn: June 17, 1980 (Age 37)\nHeight: 1.85 metres\nPlays: Right-handed\nGrand slam titles: 7 (Wimbledon 2000, 2001, 2005, 2007, 2008, U.S. Open 2000, 2001)\nVeteran Williams is among the top contenders to win her eighth grand slam and first Australian Open title following a successful campaign last year, where she finished runner-up at Melbourne Park, Wimbledon and the WTA Finals, in the absence of her sister Serena.

The 27-year-old is yet to win a major and will be keen to better her record at Melbourne Park, where she reached the semi-finals in 2011.\nMaria Sharapova (Russia)\nWorld ranking: 47\nBorn: April 19, 1987 (Age 30)\nHeight: 1.88 metres\nPlays: Right-handed\nGrand slam titles: 5 (Wimbledon 2004, French Open 2012, 2014, Australian Open 2008, U.S. Open 2006)\nWTA match record in 2018 (won-lost): 3-1\nThe resurgent Russian is among the few contenders at Melbourne Park this year to have a major title to her name. The 30-year-old returned from a doping ban last season and went on to win the Tianjin Open. Sharapova kicked off the current season with a run to the semi-finals of the Shenzhen Open last week and is in prime position to get back to her ruthless best and win her first grand slam since 2014.\nJelena Ostapenko (Latvia)\nBorn: June 8, 1997 (Age 20)\nHeight: 1.77 metres\nPlays: Right-handed\nWorld ranking: 7\nGrand slam titles: 1 (French Open 2017)\nWTA match record in 2018 (won-lost): 0-2\nFrench Open champion Ostapenko continued her momentum after her shock win at Roland Garros, reaching the quarter-finals at Wimbledon and the third round of the U.S. Open for the first time. The 20-year-old ended last season with two semi-final appearances in Wuhan and Beijing and also qualified for the WTA finals. Despite her early exit in Shenzhen and Sydney, Ostapenko will be targeting another first as she aims to reach the fourth round at Melbourne Park.\nCompiled by Aditi Prakash in Bengaluru; Editing by Toby Davis\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-01-12T20:36:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-13T14:56:25.001+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
