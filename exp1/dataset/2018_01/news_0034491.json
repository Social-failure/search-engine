Oil from the trees is sold to India and China for fragrances, cosmetics and medicinal uses.\nKordaMentha plans to run the 20-year-old business as normal, while assessing how best to recover value for all its investors.\nQuintis shares last traded in May 2017, valuing the company at A$115 million.\n$1 = 1.2505 Australian dollars Reporting by Sonali Paul; Editing by Paul Simao\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-01-22T06:01:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-22T20:40:10.012+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
