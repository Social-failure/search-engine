They hope they will be able to release him by the summer.\nReporting by Reuters TV; Writing by Mark Hanrahan in London; Editing by Andrew Heavens\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-01-04T01:15:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-03T19:33:42.014+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
