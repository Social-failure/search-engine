The FloPump 32 is one of the smallest centrifugal pumps in the world at 32ml prime. The FloPump 32 is a single use, centrifugal heart pump designed and intended to be used in conjunction with the Maquet® RotaFlow™ console.\nInternational Biophysics founder and CEO, H. David Shockley said, \"With this FDA clearance of our FloPump 32 for the U.S. market we continue to bring the highest quality surgical products to the market while lowering healthcare costs.\nAdded Mr. Shockley, \"We launched the FloPump 32 internationally to strong demand in 2017 when we received both the CE mark for Europe and ANVISA for the Brazilian market. We anticipate the same strong demand here in the U.S now that we have been cleared for this market too.\"\nOrigen Biomedical Inc. of Austin, Texas will be the sole distributor of the FloPump 32 in the United States. Origen Biomedical manufactures and sells specialized medical devices including pediatric cardiac catheters.
