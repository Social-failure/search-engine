(“Company”), (NASDAQ:PROV) the holding company for Provident Savings Bank, F.S.B. (“Bank”), today announced second quarter results for the fiscal year ending June 30, 2018.\nFor the quarter ended December 31, 2017, the Company reported a net loss of $777,000, or $(0.10) per diluted share (on 7.57 million average diluted shares outstanding), a decrease of 152 percent from net income of $1.50 million, or $0.18 per diluted share (on 8.15 million average diluted shares outstanding), in the comparable period a year ago. The current quarter results were impacted by a one-time, non-cash, net tax charge of $1.84 million, or $(0.24) per diluted share, from the net deferred tax assets revaluation required by the newly enacted Tax Cuts and Jobs Act consistent with the lower corporate tax rates adopted; and a $650,000 litigation reserve which, net of tax benefit, reduced net results by approximately $(0.06) per diluted share. Compared to the same quarter last year, the decrease in results was primarily attributable to a decrease in the gain on sale of loans, a decline in the recovery from the allowance for loan losses, lower net interest income and an increase in the provision for income taxes, partly offset by a decrease in salaries and employee benefits expense.\n“Provident, like many other companies, was required to reevaluate the value of its net deferred tax assets as a result of the newly enacted federal tax legislation. The revaluation required a large, one-time, non-cash charge for the December quarter resulting in a quarterly loss for the Company,” said Craig G. Blunden, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of the Company. “However, the tax legislation lowers corporate tax rates which will reduce the future tax obligations of the Company thereby improving net income and supporting our ability to return capital to shareholders via dividends and stock buybacks,” Mr. Blunden concluded.\nReturn on average assets for the second quarter of fiscal 2018 decreased to (0.27) percent from 0.50 percent for the same period of fiscal 2017; and return on average stockholders’ equity for the second quarter of fiscal 2018 decreased to (2.50) percent from 4.53 percent for the comparable period of fiscal 2017.\nOn a sequential quarter basis, the net loss for the second quarter of fiscal 2018 reflects a $552,000, or 245 percent, increase from the net loss of $(225,000) in the first quarter of fiscal 2018. The decrease in the second quarter of fiscal 2018 results compared to the first quarter of fiscal 2018 was primarily attributable to a $2.28 million increase in the provision for income taxes, a $530,000 decrease in the gain on sale of loans, and a $367,000 decrease in net interest income, partly offset by a $2.0 million reduction in other non-interest expense due to lower litigation settlement expense and a $636,000 decrease in salaries and employee benefits expense. Diluted earnings per share for the second quarter of fiscal 2018 were $(0.10) per share, down 233 percent, from the $(0.03) per share during the first quarter of fiscal 2018. Return on average assets decreased to (0.27) percent for the second quarter of fiscal 2018 from (0.08) percent in the first quarter of fiscal 2018; and return on average stockholders’ equity for the second quarter of fiscal 2018 was (2.50) percent, compared to (0.70) percent for the first quarter of fiscal 2018.\nFor the six months ended December 31, 2017, results decreased $4.10 million, or 132 percent, to a net loss of $1.00 million from net income of $3.10 million in the comparable period ended December 31, 2016; and diluted earnings per share for the six months ended December 31, 2017 decreased 134 percent to $(0.13) per share (on 7.63 million average diluted shares outstanding) from $0.38 per share (on 8.15 million average diluted shares outstanding) for the comparable six month period last year.\nNet interest income decreased to $8.75 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2018 from $9.09 million for the same quarter of fiscal 2017, attributable to a lower average interest-earning assets balance, and to a lesser extent, a decrease in the net interest margin. The average balance of interest-earning assets decreased by $36.7 million, or three percent, to $1.14 billion in the second quarter of fiscal 2018 from $1.18 billion in the same quarter last year. The net interest margin during the second quarter of fiscal 2018 decreased one basis point to 3.08 percent from 3.09 percent in the same quarter last year, primarily due to a decrease in the average yield of earning assets, partly offset by a decrease in the average cost of costing liabilities. The average yield on interest-earning assets decreased by four basis points to 3.64 percent in the second quarter of fiscal 2018 from 3.68 percent in the same quarter last year and the average cost of liabilities decreased by two basis points to 0.62 percent in the second quarter of fiscal 2018 from 0.64 percent in the same quarter last year.\nThe average balance of loans receivable, including loans held for sale, decreased by $59.5 million, or six percent, to $990.9 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2018 from $1.05 billion in the same quarter of fiscal 2017, primarily due to a decrease in average loans held for sale attributable to a decrease in mortgage banking activity, which was partly offset by an increase in average loans held for investment. The average yield on loans receivable increased by eight basis points to 3.93 percent in the second quarter of fiscal 2018 from an average yield of 3.85 percent in the same quarter of fiscal 2017. The increase in the average loan yield was primarily attributable to an increase in the average yield of loans held for investment and an increase in the average yield of loans held for sale with a lower percentage of loans held for sale to total loans receivable. The average balance of loans held for investment in the second quarter of fiscal 2018 was $890.2 million with an average yield of 3.93 percent, up from $853.3 million with an average yield of 3.91 percent in the same quarter of fiscal 2017; while the average balance of loans held for sale in the second quarter of fiscal 2018 was $100.7 million with an average yield of 3.91 percent, down from $197.1 million with an average yield of 3.59 percent in the same quarter of fiscal 2017. The outstanding balance of “preferred loans” (multi-family, commercial real estate, construction and commercial business loans) decreased by $10.4 million, or two percent, to $574.7 million at December 31, 2017 from $585.1 million at June 30, 2017, net of undisbursed loan funds of $7.4 million and $9.0 million, respectively. The percentage of preferred loans to total loans held for investment at December 31, 2017 increased to 65 percent from 64 percent at June 30, 2017. Loan principal payments received in the second quarter of fiscal 2018 were $57.4 million, compared to $54.7 million in the same quarter of fiscal 2017.\nThe average balance of investment securities increased by $43.0 million, or 94 percent, to $88.6 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2018 from $45.6 million in the same quarter of fiscal 2017. The increase was attributable to mortgage-backed securities purchases, partly offset by principal payments received on mortgage-backed securities. The average yield on investment securities increased 32 basis points to 1.44 percent in the second quarter of fiscal 2018 from 1.12 percent for the same quarter of fiscal 2017. The increase in the average yield was primarily attributable to mortgage-backed securities purchases which had higher average yields than the existing portfolio and the repricing of variable rate investment securities to higher market interest rates.\nIn the second quarter of fiscal 2018, the Federal Home Loan Bank (“FHLB”) – San Francisco distributed $143,000 of quarterly cash dividends to the Bank, a $315,000 or 69 percent decrease from the cash dividends received by the Bank in the same quarter last year. The cash dividends distributed in the second quarter of last year included a special cash dividend, not replicated in the second quarter of fiscal 2018.\nThe average balance of the Company’s interest-earning deposits, primarily cash with the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, decreased $20.3 million, or 29 percent, to $50.7 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2018 from $71.0 million in the same quarter of fiscal 2017. The decrease in interest-earning deposits was primarily due to funding the increase in loans held for investment and purchases of investment securities. The average yield earned on interest-earning deposits in the second quarter of fiscal 2018 was 1.30 percent, up 74 basis points from 0.56 percent in the same quarter of fiscal 2017 as a result of the impact of the increases in the federal funds rate over the last year.\nAverage deposits decreased $23.1 million, or two percent, to $916.2 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2018 from $939.3 million in the same quarter of fiscal 2017. The average cost of deposits decreased by three basis points to 0.38 percent in the second quarter of fiscal 2018 from 0.41 percent in the same quarter last year, primarily due to a lower percentage of time deposits to the total deposit balance. Transaction account balances or “core deposits” increased $2.1 million to $660.7 million at December 31, 2017 from $658.6 million at June 30, 2017, while time deposits decreased $20.7 million, or eight percent, to $247.1 million at December 31, 2017 from $267.9 million at June 30, 2017, consistent with the Bank’s strategy to decrease the percentage of time deposits in its deposit base and to increase the percentage of lower cost checking and savings accounts.\nThe average balance of borrowings, which consisted of FHLB – San Francisco advances, decreased $8.0 million, or seven percent, to $111.5 million while the average cost of advances increased 15 basis points to 2.59 percent in the second quarter of fiscal 2018, compared to an average balance of $119.5 million with an average cost of 2.44 percent in the same quarter of fiscal 2017. The increase in the average cost of advances was primarily due to the maturity of short-term advances in the second quarter of fiscal 2017 with a cost well below the weighted average cost of existing advances.\nDuring the second quarter of fiscal 2018, the Company recorded a recovery from the allowance for loan losses of $11,000, compared to the recovery from the allowance for loan losses of $350,000 recorded during the same period of fiscal 2017 and the provision for loan losses of $169,000 recorded in the first quarter of fiscal 2018 (sequential quarter). The recovery from the allowance for loan losses was primarily attributable to the decrease in loans held for investment during the second quarter of fiscal 2018.\nNon-performing assets, with underlying collateral located in California, decreased $1.0 million, or 10 percent, to $8.6 million, or 0.74 percent of total assets, at December 31, 2017, compared to $9.6 million, or 0.80 percent of total assets, at June 30, 2017. Non-performing loans at December 31, 2017 were unchanged from June 30, 2017 at $8.0 million and were primarily comprised of 29 single-family loans ($7.9 million) and one commercial business loan ($61,000). At December 31, 2017, there was $621,000 of real estate owned outstanding comprised of one single-family property which was acquired during the second quarter, while two single-family real estate owned properties, totaling $1.6 million at June 30, 2017, were sold during the first quarter of fiscal 2018.\nNet loan recoveries for the quarter ended December 31, 2017 were $23,000 or (0.01) percent (annualized) of average loans receivable, compared to net loan recoveries of $16,000 or (0.01) percent (annualized) of average loans receivable for the quarter ended December 31, 2016 and net loan charge-offs of $145,000 or 0.06 percent (annualized) of average loans receivable for the quarter ended September 30, 2017 (sequential quarter).\nClassified assets at December 31, 2017 were $13.8 million, comprised of $3.6 million of loans in the special mention category, $9.6 million of loans in the substandard category and $621,000 in real estate owned. Classified assets at June 30, 2017 were $13.3 million, comprised of $3.7 million of loans in the special mention category, $8.0 million of loans in the substandard category and $1.6 million in real estate owned. For the quarter ended December 31, 2017, no loans were restructured from their original terms or newly classified as a restructured loan.\nThe allowance for loan losses was $8.1 million at December 31, 2017, or 0.90 percent of gross loans held for investment, compared to $8.0 million at June 30, 2017, or 0.88 percent of gross loans held for investment. Management believes that, based on currently available information, the allowance for loan losses is sufficient to absorb potential losses inherent in loans held for investment at December 31, 2017.\nNon-interest income decreased by $2.09 million, or 27 percent, to $5.74 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2018 from $7.83 million in the same period of fiscal 2017, primarily as a result of a decrease in the gain on sale of loans during the current quarter as compared to the comparable period last year. On a sequential quarter basis, non-interest income decreased $611,000, or 10 percent, primarily as a result of a decrease in the gain on sale of loans.\nThe gain on sale of loans decreased $2.16 million, or 33 percent, to $4.32 million for the quarter ended December 31, 2017 from $6.48 million in the comparable quarter last year, and decreased $530,000 or 11 percent from the quarter ended September 30, 2017 (sequential quarter), reflecting the impact of a lower loan sale volume, partly offset by a higher average loan sale margin. Total loan sale volume, which includes the net change in commitments to extend credit on loans to be held for sale, was $287.8 million in the quarter ended December 31, 2017, down $175.4 million or 38 percent, from $463.2 million in the comparable quarter last year and decreased $104.4 million or 27 percent from the quarter ended September 30, 2017 (sequential quarter). The average loan sale margin from mortgage banking was 149 basis points for the quarter ended December 31, 2017, up 10 basis points from 139 basis points in the same quarter last year and up 25 basis points from 124 basis points in the first quarter of fiscal 2018 (sequential quarter). The gain on sale of loans includes an unfavorable fair-value adjustment on loans held for sale and derivative financial instruments (commitments to extend credit, commitments to sell loans, commitments to sell mortgage-backed securities, and option contracts) that amounted to a net loss of $1.30 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2018, compared to an unfavorable fair-value adjustment that amounted to a net loss of $6.40 million in the same period last year and an unfavorable fair-value adjustment that amounted to a net loss of $94,000 in the first quarter of fiscal 2018 (sequential quarter).\nIn the second quarter of fiscal 2018, $331.9 million of loans were originated and purchased for sale, 39 percent lower than the $541.9 million for the same period last year, and 15 percent lower than the $392.3 million during the first quarter of fiscal 2018 (sequential quarter). The loan origination volume has decreased from the previous year because increased mortgage interest rates have reduced refinance activity. Total loans sold during the quarter ended December 31, 2017 were $361.4 million, 43 percent lower than the $638.5 million sold during the same quarter last year, and five percent lower than the $381.1 million sold during the first quarter of fiscal 2018 (sequential quarter). Total loan originations (including loans originated and purchased for investment and loans originated and purchased for sale) were $366.8 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2018, a decrease of 39 percent from $605.3 million in the same quarter of fiscal 2017, and 16 percent lower than the $437.2 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2018 (sequential quarter).\nNon-interest expenses decreased $1.46 million to $13.21 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2018 from $14.67 million in the same quarter last year. The decrease was primarily due to a $1.72 million decrease in salaries and employee benefits expense. The decrease in salaries and employee benefits expense was primarily related to lower variable compensation resulting from lower mortgage banking loan originations and staff reductions in mortgage banking. On a sequential quarter basis, non-interest expenses decreased $2.52 million, or 16 percent, primarily as a result of a decrease in salaries and employee benefits expense and other non-interest expenses due to lower litigation settlement expense.\nThe Company’s efficiency ratio in the second quarter of fiscal 2018 was 91 percent, up from 87 percent in the same quarter last year and an improvement from 102 percent in the first quarter of fiscal 2018 (sequential quarter).\nThe Company’s income tax provision was $2.07 million for the second quarter of fiscal 2018, up 89 percent from the $1.10 million provision for income taxes in the same quarter last year. The increase was primarily attributable to the net deferred tax asset revaluation, partly offset by lower income before taxes and the reduction of the federal tax rate. The Company believes that the tax provision recorded in the second quarter of fiscal 2018 reflects its current income tax obligations.\nThe Tax Cuts and Jobs Act enacted on December 22, 2017 provides a reduced federal tax rate for the Company, a reduction from 35% to 21% as of January 1, 2018. However, the Company’s fiscal year runs through June 30 th of each year. As a result, the Company will be required to use a blended statutory tax rate for the fiscal year ending on June 30, 2018 and will not realize the full impact of the reduced federal tax rate until fiscal 2019 which begins on July 1, 2018. The estimated combined federal and state statutory tax rates, before discrete items, for the remainder of fiscal 2018 and for fiscal 2019 are as follows:\nStatutory Tax Rates Q3FY2018 Q4FY2018 FY2019 Federal Tax Rate 28.06% 28.06% 21.00% State Tax Rate 10.84% 10.84% 10.84% Combined Statutory Tax Rate 35.86% 35.86% 29.56% The Company’s effective tax rate may differ from the estimated statutory tax rates described above due to discrete items such as further adjustments to net deferred tax assets, excess tax benefits derived from stock option exercises and non-taxable earnings from bank owned life insurance, among other items.\nThe Company repurchased 140,526 shares of its common stock during the quarter ended December 31, 2017 at an average cost of $19.23 per share. As of December 31, 2017, a total of 266,526 shares or 69 percent of the shares authorized in the June 2017 stock repurchase plan have been purchased, leaving 118,674 shares available for future purchases.\nThe Bank currently operates 14 retail/business banking offices in Riverside County and San Bernardino County (Inland Empire). Provident Bank Mortgage operates two wholesale loan production offices and nine retail loan production offices located throughout California.\nThe Company will host a conference call for institutional investors and bank analysts on Tuesday, January 30, 2018 at 9:00 a.m. (Pacific) to discuss its financial results. The conference call can be accessed by dialing 1-800-230-1085 and requesting the Provident Financial Holdings Earnings Release Conference Call.
