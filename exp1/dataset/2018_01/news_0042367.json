It’s great for me and the team that we were able to make this announcement this early on, because it gives us a sense of calm,” Vinales said in a statement. \n“We know that I will continue riding my M1 for the coming three seasons, so now we can just focus on the actual racing.” \nThe MotoGP season starts in Qatar on March 18.
