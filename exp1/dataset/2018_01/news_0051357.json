Fibria reduced its leverage from 3.2 to 2.4 times EBITDA, prepaying some of its debt.\nBecause most of Fibria’s debt is denominated in dollars, the depreciation of Brazil’s currency — such as a 5 percent slide in the fourth quarter and a more dramatic swing a year earlier — weighs on short-term earnings, although it provides long-term benefits to the company’s export-focused business model.\n$1 = 3.15 reais Reporting by Tatiana Bautzer; Editing by Marguerita Choy and Susan Thomas\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-30T00:44:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-30T01:04:58.008+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
