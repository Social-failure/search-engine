HKMRCC has since confirmed the death of the air-lifted crew member.” \nOrganizers said the U.S./Danish entry had retired from the leg -- which started in Melbourne and ended in Hong Kong -- with the boat proceeding to Hong Kong unassisted and under its own power. \nAmerican Mark Towill, a team co-founder with Charlie Enright, was the skipper for Leg Four. The team won the opening leg of the race in October and had been on course to finish second in Leg Four. \nThe 2017-18 Volvo Ocean Race started from Alicante, Spain, on Oct. 22 and covers 45,000 nautical miles (83,000 km) around the world, featuring a total of 12 host ports. It ends in The Hague, Netherlands, at the end of June. \nThe fourth leg was won by Hong Kong-based Sun Hung Kai/Scallywag, skippered by Australian David Witt.
