But his hamstrings were a little bit tight after a quality week of training,” Gatland told a news conference. \nNorth has made just two replacement appearances since October because of a knee injury. \n“He didn’t train with us on Monday because he was still recovering. He’s going to be released back to Northampton to get a game this weekend to hopefully put him in contention for a place against England,” added Gatland. \nNorthampton play Harlequins on Friday in the Anglo-Welsh Cup. Wales play England in their second Six Nations match on Feb. 10.
