She is now responding well to treatment. The whereabouts of the cub's parents are unknown.\n\"Unfortunately, we see this all too often,\" says Bobbi Brink, Founder and Director of Lions Tigers & Bears Big Cat and Exotic Animal Rescue, the accredited animal sanctuary where the tiger will now live out the rest of her life. \"The exotic pet trade is a multi-billion dollar industry, often leading to illegal ownership like in this case. Many of these animals are pulled from their mothers when they are only days old. They are then subjected to very poor living conditions at the hands of individuals who quickly become overwhelmed by the level of care a full-grown wild animal requires. This in turn poses a very real threat to public health and safety.\"\nThe tiger cub arrived at Lions Tigers & Bears on December 22, 2017, where she continues to receive ongoing medical care.\nWhite tigers are not classified as a subspecies, nor are they considered albino. The lack of color in the animal's fur is referred to as leucism, a genetic mutation that occurs naturally in 1 out of every 10,000 births among Bengal tigers in the wild.\nCall or email in advance to attend a Media Preview Day of the tiger cub on Thursday, January 4, 2018 at 10:00 a.m. at Lions Tigers & Bears.\nAbout Lions Tigers & Bears\nLions Tigers & Bears is a federally and state licensed 501(c)(3) nonprofit rescue facility dedicated to providing a safe haven to abused and abandoned exotic animals while inspiring an educational forum to end the exotic animal trade.
