The KRG would accept that representatives of the Iraqi civil aviation authority would be posted in the two airports to oversee the implementation of federal regulations, it said.\nReporting by Maher Chmaytelli; Editing by Janet Lawrence\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-01-20T21:54:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-21T13:23:04.011+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
