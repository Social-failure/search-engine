Protesters reportedly later blocked roads and destroyed a number of properties.”\nEthiopian government spokesman Negeri Lencho, reacting to Shamdasani’s statement, told journalists on Tuesday that demands by the public should be “raised peacefully.” Security forces should exercise restraint and avoid actions that could lead to death and injury, he said.\nShamdasani did not specify the source of the information but said the U.N.’s regional office in Addis Ababa had collected information from several sources, including local media, trusted civil society sources and official statements.\nThe incident was all the more regrettable as it came just two weeks after Ethiopia’s ruling coalition, the Ethiopian People’s Revolutionary Democratic Front, announced its intention of undertaking reforms, she added.\n“We understand that the President of Amhara Regional State, who confirmed that there had been deaths and injuries, said there would be what he termed a ‘careful examination’ of the incident.”\nShe said it should be prompt, independent, impartial and effective and ensure anybody responsible for violating human rights was held accountable.\nReporting by Tom Miles,; Additional reporting by Aaron Masho in Addis Ababa,; Editing by Richard Balmforth\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-01-24T01:25:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-23T20:41:01.035+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
