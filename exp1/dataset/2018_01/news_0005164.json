Depletions, or distributor shipments to retail customers, rose 9.1 percent due to the Labor Day and Thanksgiving holidays in the quarter. \nNet income rose to $491.1 million, or $2.44 per share, in the third quarter ended Nov. 30, from $405.9 million, or $1.98 per share, a year earlier. \nExcluding one-time items the company earned $2.00 per share, beating analysts’ average estimate of $1.89 per share. \nNet sales fell marginally to $1.80 billion from $1.81 billion but missed analysts' estimates of $1.87 billion. ( bit.ly/2F3QAxl ) \nThe company also raised its full-year profit forecast to $8.40-$8.50 per share. Analysts were expecting $8.43. \nReporting by Siddharth Cavale in Bengaluru; Editing by Martina D'Couto and Patrick Graham\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-05T14:44:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-05T14:52:23.039+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
