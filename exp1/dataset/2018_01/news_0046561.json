REUTERS/Denis Balibouse BREXIT TRANSITION Supporters of Brexit say that warnings of economic chaos are overblown and that Britain will eventually prosper once it leaves what they portray as a decaying, German-dominated experiment in European integration.\nSome of May’s Brexit-supporting lawmakers, such as Jacob Rees-Mogg, said Britain’s government must start promoting the opportunities from leaving the European Union and its negotiators should stop being “cowed by the EU”.\nIn an effort to avoid a Brexit shock that could sow chaos through financial markets, halt trade and disrupt supply chains across Europe, Britain wants a transition deal agreed by the end of March that would roll for about two years after exit.\nUnder current plans, Britain will remain an EU member in everything but name but will have no representation in EU decision-making bodies. Britain would remain part of the EU’s customs union and internal market and be bound by EU laws.\nHammond said, “A transition period which allows us to continue under the present rules where everybody understands those rules gives us time to do this in an orderly fashion and gives us time to address some of the financial stability challenges.”\nBut opponents of Brexit say there is little clarity on where Britain is transitioning to and hope to force a halt to the divorce, a prospect Hammond dismissed.\n“This decision is not going to be reversed. That is a matter of political reality,” he said.\nIn Brussels, EU diplomats said the bloc is willing to be flexible on the duration and other terms of a Brexit transition period as Britain prepares to detail its hopes for what happens after it leaves the bloc.\nSome businesses, and many international banks in London, are concerned that either the detail of any transition deal could be lacking or that any deal could collapse due to domestic political upheaval in the months before Britain exits.\n“It’s all or nothing,” said a senior executive at one of the largest banks in London. “They can’t even give us political certainty, let alone legal certainty until much, much later in the process.”\nAdditional reporting by Alastair Macdonald in Brussels; writing by Guy Faulconbridge and Andrew MacAskill; editing by Mark Heinrich\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-01-26T01:51:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-26T11:49:06.008+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
