The tiny beads of plastic help with exfoliating the skin, but are seen as a blight on wildlife, particularly marine life, and environmental groups welcomed the ban. The Marine Conservation Society's Senior Pollution Officer, Sue Kinsey, said the group was \"delighted that such a robust microbead ban\" had come into force. Kinsey added that the ban was the strongest and most comprehensive to be enacted and that it would help to \"stem the flow of micro plastics into our oceans.\" Friends of the Earth waste campaigner, Julian Kirby, described the ban on microbeads in rinse-off cosmetics and cleaning products as \"an important step towards protecting wildlife and human health from the scourge of plastic pollution.\" There was still room for improvement, however, with Kirby adding that the ban did not cover a host of products like lipstick, sun cream and paints. The government said that a ban on the sale of products containing microbeads would be introduced later this year.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-09T14:15:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-09T13:31:10.018+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
