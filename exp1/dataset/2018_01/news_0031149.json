Tennis - Australian Open - Rod Laver Arena, Melbourne, Australia, January 20, 2018. Maria Sharapova of Russia reacts during her match against Angelique Kerber of Germany. REUTERS/Thomas Peter \nBut Kerber, who plummeted down the rankings last year after finishing the year before at number one, broke her serve in the first game of the match and that set the tone for what followed. \nShe streaked away with the first set and although 2008 champion Sharapova briefly threatened a fightback after falling behind in the second, it was not to be the Russian’s night. \nA fluffed drop shot attempt at 3-4 followed by an unforced error gave 2016 champion Kerber breathing space and she finished the contest in the next game.
