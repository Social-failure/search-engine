Two good pace attacks going at it. Batting’s going to be hard work. \n“They’ve got some good bowlers and we’re going to have to show some good fight and good resilience out in the middle against their quicks, and (Keshav) Maharaj as well, who’s come a long way as a spinner.” \nSpearhead Dale Steyn is nursing a heel injury and racing against time to be fit for the Durban opener, but the last two India tests proved South Africa have a potent quartet in Vernon Philander, Morne Morkel, Kagiso Rabada and rookie Lungi Ngidi. \nAustralia’s pace attack was equally as impressive in the 4-0 Ashes triumph against England, also completed earlier this month, and Smith had no doubt that Mitchell Starc, Josh Hazlewood and Pat Cummins would prove potent in South Africa. \n”They could go a couple of different ways with their wickets,“ he said. ”For us, it’s just about adapting to whatever they throw at us. \n”I guess the thing with Australia and South Africa is the conditions are probably the two most similar around the world. \n“The wickets are generally pretty similar and the pace and bounce. From that aspect it’s (easier to adjust).” \nAfter the first test starting on March 1, the series moves on to further matches in Port Elizabeth, Cape town and Johannesburg.
