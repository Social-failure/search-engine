(the \"Company\" or \"Coeur\") (NYSE: CDE) today announced record fourth quarter silver equivalent 1 production of 11.7 million ounces, consisting of 4.5 million ounces of silver and 119,114 ounces of gold. Silver equivalent 1 production increased 23% quarter-over-quarter and 17% year-over-year. Silver production increased 15% quarter-over-quarter and 17% year-over-year, while gold production increased 28% and 16%.\nThis press release features multimedia. View the full release here: http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180108006063/en/\nQuarterly Production Results (Graphic: Business Wire)\nFull-year 2017 silver equivalent 1 production, also the highest in Company history, totaled 39.4 million ounces, which was 9% higher compared to 2016. Full-year silver production was 16.4 million ounces, 11% higher than in 2016 and at the high-end of the Company's guidance of 15.3 - 16.6 million ounces. Full-year gold production was 383,444 ounces, 7% higher than in 2016 and in-line with Company guidance of 367,000 - 392,000 ounces. Production growth was driven primarily by the Palmarejo mine, where 2017 silver equivalent 1 production increased 64% compared to 2016.\nIn 2018, Coeur expects to produce 36.6 - 40.0 million silver equivalent 1 ounces, consisting of 12.8 - 14.4 million ounces of silver, 355,000 - 375,000 ounces of gold, and 23.0 - 28.0 million pounds of both zinc and lead.\nMetal sales for the fourth quarter of 4.6 million ounces of silver and 123,675 ounces of gold, or 12.0 million silver equivalent 1 ounces, were in-line with production. Full-year metal sales of 16.9 million ounces of silver and 410,715 ounces of gold, or 41.6 million silver equivalent 1 ounces, reflects a reduction in inventory carried over from 2016.\nOperations\nFourth quarter and full-year 2017 production and sales highlights for each of Coeur's operations are provided below.\nPalmarejo, Mexico\n2017 4Q 2017 3Q 2017 2Q 2017 1Q 2017 2016 4Q 2016 Tons milled 1,498,421 389,524 413,086 335,428 360,383 1,078,888 287,569 Average silver grade (oz/t) 5.62 6.92 5.53 4.98 4.91 4.66 4.95 Average gold grade (oz/t) 0.09 0.10 0.08 0.08 0.09 0.08 0.09 Average recovery rate – Ag 86.0% 87.0% 83.6% 87.3% 86.5% 88.4% 89.1% Average recovery rate – Au 90.0% 92.0% 83.1% 91.1% 93.7% 86.5% 90.4% Ounces Produced Silver (000's) 7,242 2,346 1,908 1,457 1,531 4,442 1,269 Gold 121,569 37.537 28,948 24,292 30,792 73,913 23,906 Silver equivalent 1 (000's) 14,536 4,600 3,644 2,914 3,378 8,877 2,703 Ounces Sold Silver (000's) 7,586 2,343 1,794 1,484 1,965 3,993 937 Gold 131,743 38,953 26,554 25,191 41,045 59,081 15,558 Silver equivalent 1 (000's) 15,491 4,681 3,387 2,996 4,427 7,538 1,872 Silver equivalent 1 (average spot) (000's) 17,301 5,331 3,809 3,324 4,837 8,305 2,042 Fourth quarter silver equivalent 1 production increased 26% quarter-over-quarter and 70% year-over-year to 4.6 million ounces, while full-year 2017 silver equivalent 1 production of 14.5 million ounces was above the high-end of the Company's guidance range and represented an increase of 64% over 2016 Fourth quarter silver and gold grades rose approximately 25%, quarter-over-quarter, while full-year 2017 silver and gold grades increased 21% and 12%, respectively, compared to 2016 due to mining of higher-grade zones at Independencia. Grades are expected to decrease gradually during the first quarter of 2018 due to mine sequencing Higher recovery rates during the fourth quarter resulted from normalization of mill inventory levels Fourth quarter silver and gold sales were in-line with production, while full-year sales were higher than production due to a reduction in inventory carried over from the fourth quarter of 2016 Gold sales during the quarter and year included 13,740 and 52,124 ounces, respectively, sold to Franco-Nevada at a price of $800 per ounce Full-year 2018 production is expected to be 6.5 - 7.1 million ounces of silver and 110,000 - 115,000 ounces of gold, or 13.1 - 14.0 million silver equivalent 1 ounces\nRochester, Nevada\n2017 4Q 2017 3Q 2017 2Q 2017 1Q 2017 2016 4Q 2016 Tons placed 16,440,270 4,171,451 4,262,011 4,493,100 3,513,708 19,555,998 3,878,487 Average silver grade (oz/t) 0.53 0.50 0.53 0.53 0.58 0.57 0.57 Average gold grade (oz/t) 0.003 0.003 0.004 0.003 0.002 0.003 0.002 Ounces Produced Silver (000's) 4,714 1,361 1,070 1,156 1,127 4,564 1,277 Gold 51,051 18,995 10,955 10,745 10,356 50,751 14,231 Silver equivalent 1 (000's) 7,777 2,500 1,727 1,801 1,749 7,609 2,131 Ounces Sold Silver (000's) 4,931 1,457 1,050 1,135 1,289 4,584 1,205 Gold 54,642 20,002 10,390 10,658 13,592 49,320 12,988 Silver equivalent 1 (000's) 8,210 2,658 1,674 1,774 2,104 7,543 1,984 Silver equivalent 1 (average spot) (000's) 8,961 2,969 1,839 1,913 2,240 8,183 2,128 Fourth quarter silver equivalent 1 production increased 45% quarter-over-quarter to 2.5 million ounces, with silver production increasing 27% to 1.4 million ounces and gold production rising 73% to 18,995 ounces. Higher production was driven by concurrent leaching of the Stage III and Stage IV pads as well as the timing of recoveries from the newly-expanded Stage IV leach pad. Gold production also benefited from the placement of higher gold grade ore during the third quarter and early fourth quarter Full-year silver equivalent 1 production of 7.8 million ounces was relatively unchanged year-over-year due to the completion of construction and commissioning of the Stage IV leach pad Full-year 2018 production is expected to be 4.2 - 4.7 million ounces of silver and 45,000 - 50,000 ounces of gold, or 6.9 - 7.7 million silver equivalent 1 ounces\nKensington, Alaska\n2017\n4Q 2017 3Q 2017 2Q 2017 1Q 2017 2016 4Q 2016 Tons milled 668,727 167,631 172,038 163,163 165,895 620,209 163,410 Average gold grade (oz/t) 0.18 0.22 0.17 0.17 0.17 0.21 0.22 Average recovery rate 93.5% 92.8% 94.1% 93.2% 94.0% 94.7% 94.4% Gold ounces produced 115,094 34,932 27,541 26,424 26,197 124,331 33,688 Gold ounces sold 125,982 35,634 29,173 29,031 32,144 121,688 28,864 Fourth quarter gold production increased 27% quarter-over-quarter to 34,932 ounces, Kensington's highest quarterly production since the fourth quarter of 2013. This was primarily the result of mining the higher-grade Raven zone, which drove average grades 29% higher to 0.22 oz/ton Full-year production of 115,094 ounces was below the Company guidance range due to lower-than-expected grades throughout the first nine months of the year Full-year gold sales were higher than production due to reductions in inventory throughout the year, particularly in the first quarter During the fourth quarter, mining of development ore continued at Jualin, where production is expected to accelerate throughout 2018 as the Company dewaters the mine area to facilitate more efficient drilling, development, and mining activities Raven is expected to remain a supplemental source of higher-grade material throughout the year 2018 gold production is expected to total 115,000 - 120,000 ounces\nWharf, South Dakota\n2017 4Q 2017 3Q 2017 2Q 2017 1Q 2017 2016 4Q 2016 Tons placed 4,560,441 1,124,785 1,150,308 993,167 1,292,181 4,268,105 1,178,803 Average gold grade (oz/t) 0.027 0.029 0.029 0.024 0.027 0.032 0.027 Ounces produced Gold 95,372 27,292 25,849 21,358 20,873 109,175 30,675 Silver (000's) 64 16 15 13 20 105 32 Gold equivalent 1 96,431 27,560 26,096 21,568 21,207 110,927 31,202 Ounc", "external_links": ["http://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.coeur.com&esheet=51739169&lan=en-US&anchor=www.coeur.com&index=1&md5=2ae294de1906cdebc8e7220834c4b669", "http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180108006063/en/"], "published": "2018-01-08T16:03:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-08T19:39:04.003+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
