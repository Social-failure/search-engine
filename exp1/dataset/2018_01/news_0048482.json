REUTERS/Beawiharta/File Photo Junimart Girsang, a member of parliament from the nationalist Indonesian Democratic Party of Stuggle (PDIP), said same-sex relations could not be accepted in the country.\n“In legal terms, religious terms and ethical terms, we cannot have that in our country,” Girsang, a member of the parliamentary commission, said.\nFew Indonesian politicians have voiced support for LGBT rights for fear of alienating a largely conservative voter base ahead of legislative and presidential elections next year.\nParliament has debated revisions to the criminal code, including regulations on corruption, sex and alcohol, for many years. But after repeated delays it is expected to finalize proposals during coming weeks.\nRights activists say the proposals, if approved, would be difficult to police without violating privacy and could threaten social development.\n“The draft law will create new discriminatory offences that do not exist in the current criminal code. It will slow down Indonesia’s efforts to develop their economy, society, knowledge, education etc....if law enforcement agencies are busy policing morality,” said Andreas Harsono of Human Rights Watch.\n“It’s sounding like the Acehnese sharia code,” he added, referring to the ultra-conservative province at the northern tip of Sumatra island, which is the only Indonesian region to implement Islamic law.\nActivists are particularly worried the new law may be used to target the lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) community, which has faced rising hostility in recent years.\nA recent survey found that nearly 90 percent of Indonesians who understand the term LGBT feel “threatened” by the community and believe their religion forbids same-sex relations.\nAdditional reporting by Ed Davies; Writing by Kanupriya Kapoor; Editing by Simon Cameron-Moore\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-01-29T18:47:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-29T15:13:38.003+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
