I take that as a reference. But for sure, you will have your own solution.” \nAsked whether there would be a bespoke, special solution for Britain, he replied: ”Sure, but you will ... I take these two references because this special way should be consistent with the preservation of the single market and our collective interests. \n“And you should understand that you cannot by definition have the full access to the single market if you don’t tick the box.” \n\nBritain's Prime Minister Theresa May and France's President Emmanuel Macron hold a news conference at the Royal Military Academy in Sandhurst, Britain, January 18, 2018.

[nL8N1PD1PY] \n“It depends on the proposals made by the UK,” he said. “But for sure, full access for financial services to the single market is not feasible, given the functioning of the single market - so by definition it’s not a full access.” \nBritain and the EU struck a divorce deal last month that paved the way for talks on future trade ties and boosted hopes of an orderly Brexit. \nThe BBC released extracts on Saturday of the Macron interview which it will broadcast in full in the Andrew Marr Show on Sunday. \nReporting by Stephen Addison; Editing by Janet Lawrence\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-20T14:07:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-20T14:22:58.005+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
