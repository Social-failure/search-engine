Reuters was unable to verify the figures.\n“The attacks happened in very remote villages,” said Akase. “Now, with security operatives on the ground, villagers have been going about the bush to pick up more corpses.”\nNigeria’s police inspector general, Ibrahim Idris, told reporters last week that the country was secure, though more police would be deployed to Benue state to deal with the violence.\n“What we should be praying for is for Nigerians to learn to live in peace with each other,” said Idris.\nNigerian troops have been deployed in more than 30 of the 36 states to tackle insecurity - something which has thrown a critical spotlight on the performance of the police.\nIn November, at least 30 people from a cattle herding community, including young children, were killed in a clash in the northeastern state of Adamawa.\nReporting by Anamesere Igboeroteonwu; Writing by Paul Carsten; Editing by Richard Balmforth\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-08T13:29:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-08T13:48:16.012+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
