Although the United States pulled out of the talks to form the bloc nearly a year ago, other TPP countries have pledged to move forward with plans for a trade group.\nThe TPP has so far involved only countries around the Pacific Rim such as Japan, Canada and Mexico. However, junior trade minister Greg Hands said there was no geographical restriction that would prevent Britain’s participation.\n“Nothing is excluded in all of this,” he told the Financial Times. “With these kind of plurilateral relationships, there doesn’t have to be any geographical restriction.”\nEU rules state that Britain cannot agree new trade deals before it leaves the bloc in March 2019. The newspaper Quote: d an official from a TPP country as saying it was “way too soon” to discuss UK accession before a Brexit deal.\nReporting by Alistair Smout; editing by Guy Faulconbridge\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-03T09:53:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-03T10:06:23.013+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
