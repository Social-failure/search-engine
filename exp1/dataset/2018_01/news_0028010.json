CFIUS last year also blocked German chipmaker Infineon’s ( IFXGn.DE ) attempts to buy Wolfspeed Power, a unit of U.S. LED lighting maker Cree ( CREE.O ).\nReporting by Tom Sims; Editing by Adrian Croft\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-19T21:15:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-19T21:29:28.026+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
