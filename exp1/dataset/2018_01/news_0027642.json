[nL1N1PB0K6]\nWednesday’s raids targeted 15 sites in Berlin and six other states as part of a joint German-Polish investigation launched in spring 2017.\nThe investigation, aided by Polish border authorities, found the gang was charging 8,000 euros ($9,778.40) per person to obtain a visa, and had earned a total of more than 300,000 euros ($366,690.00).\nGermany’s de Maiziere said the successful raids showed the importance of border controls, adding that Poland had also taken additional measures. He did not elaborate.\nAbout 48,000 asylum seekers from Syria arrived in Germany in 2017, according to data published on Tuesday, adding to almost half a million Syrian refugees who arrived in the previous two years.\nThe total number of asylum seekers registered in Germany in 2017 stood at 186,000, down 33 percent from 2016.\nReporting By Riham Alkousaa; Editing by Andrea Shalal and Gareth Jones\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-01-18T00:36:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-18T16:25:58.007+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
