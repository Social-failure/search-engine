Markos Kem/Fun With Balls GmbH/Handout via REUTERS Tour chiefs hope to incorporate technology for automated calls on the out lines, as well as the tin, if the trial concept proves successful. Plans are also in place to combine iSquash’s front wall technology with the tour system, meaning that statistical data can be projected onto the court wall in between games for spectators.\nYOUNGER GENERATION Kern said he will also create an e-squash governing body to harness the growing popularity of e-sports.\nSlideshow (2 Images) “If squash doesn’t innovate for the digital age then what chance do we have of young people picking up a racket?” added Kern.\n“This is a perfect combination of gaming and a real sport.”\nAttracting a youthful audience is also pivotal for a sport harboring dreams of Olympic inclusion after failing to convince the International Olympic Committee in its last three bids.\n“The possibilities that this technology offers us are endless, and will allow us to tap into a younger, tech-savvy audience,” added Gough.\nThe Paris Games, however, represent squash’s best chance of Olympic inclusion.\nFrenchman Jacques Fontaine was elected World Squash Federation president in 2016, while former fencer Laura Flessel, now France’s sport minister, used squash as a training tool as she became France’s most decorated female Olympian, before retiring after London 2012.\nFrance’s Gregory Gaultier is currently world number one in the men’s game.\n“This technology will take the sport to another level,” he told Reuters.\nEditing by Christian Radnedge\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-11T11:11:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-11T11:27:08.011+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
