In a recent special election for a city council seat, the Vision candidate placed fifth.\nRobertson gained international attention as the face of Vancouver during the 2010 Winter Olympics, and more recently for his relationship with Chinese pop star Wanting Qu.\nReporting by Julie Gordon; Editing by Peter Cooney\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-11T04:17:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-11T05:03:40.018+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
