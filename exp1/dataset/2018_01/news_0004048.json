(OTCPINK “TMED”) today reported its financial results for its Fiscal Year ending on September 30, 2017.\nFor the Fiscal Year Ended September 30, 2017, Trimedyne had revenues of $4,695,000, a decrease of 8% from revenues of $5,109,000 for the prior year. We had a net loss for the current fiscal year of $44,000 or $0.36 per share, as compared to a net loss of $536,000 or $4.37 per share for the prior fiscal year, adjusted for a 150 to one reverse stock split in November, 2016. This 92% decrease in net loss as compared to the prior fiscal year is a considerable improvement, which was primarily the result of decreases in R&D expense and selling, general and administrative expense totaling $501,000, as we are continuing to carefully control our costs.\nAt the end of the fiscal year on September 30, 2017, we had cash and cash equivalents of $1,161,000, which included $580,000 in customer deposits for future orders, as compared to $307,000 at the end of the prior fiscal year.\nCommenting on the financial results for the quarter, Marvin P. Loeb, Sc.D., Chairman of Trimedyne, said: “Since we are no longer required to file periodic reports with the SEC, our Financial Statements are un-audited. However, we believe our Financial Statements have been prepared and contain all adjustments of a recurring nature that are necessary for a fair appraisal of our operations and financial condition for the periods and dates shown below.\n“We appreciate the patience of our shareholders and are working hard to improve our financial condition.”\nCONTACT: Jeffrey Rudner (949) 951-3800, Ext. 285 jrudner@trimedyne.com\nSource:Trimedyne, Inc.", "external_links": ["https://www.globenewswire.com/NewsRoom/AttachmentNg/63873946-ca9e-439d-9cc9-0874ccd2897e"], "published": "2018-01-03T17:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-03T18:44:16.075+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
