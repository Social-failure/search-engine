He faces 142 years in a different case on terrorism charges.\nThe HDP denies authorities’ accusations of links to the Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK) rebel group, which has been fighting government forces in southeastern Turkey since 1984. The group is deemed a terrorist organisation by the United States, Turkey and Europe.\nLIMITS OF CRITICISM FILE PHOTO: Selahattin Demirtas, co-leader of the pro-Kurdish Peoples' Democratic Party (HDP) is seen during an interview with Reuters at the European Parliament in Brussels, Belgium, January 27, 2016. REUTERS/Yves Herman/File Photo The court has not allowed Demirtas to attend hearings for the other cases citing security reasons, and he has refused to take part via video link.\nOn Friday he gave a brief statement to the court, objecting to the government’s removal of the parliamentary immunity that he enjoyed as a lawmaker, which exempted him from investigation or prison while in office, according to the HDP.\nThe party described him as smiling and in high spirits. A Reuters reporter at the courthouse was not able to enter the courtroom. The case was adjourned until May 17.\nSlideshow (2 Images) Hundreds of supporters gathered across the street from the courthouse, chanting “Selahattin Demirtas is our pride,” and “Shoulder to shoulder against fascism”.\n“Our aim is to intimidate the ruling government, to show that HDP has not ended and the people siding with freedom are not gone,” said one of the supporters, who declined to be identified.\nAround 100 special police were posted outside the courthouse, armed with tear gas and automatic rifles.\nA prosecutor charged that Demirtas’s comments breached “the limits of acceptable criticism,” and were an “unjust attack” on Erdogan’s personal rights.\nIn addition to Demirtas, nine other HDP members are detained, including its other co-leader, Figen Yuksekdag. They are mostly accused of links to the PKK. All deny the charges.\nEditing by David Dolan and Ralph Boulton\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-12T17:47:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-12T18:02:51.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
