RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nNet Income\nNet income for 2017 increased $2.4 million, or 17.1%, to $16.4 million compared with $14.0 million in the previous year. Diluted earnings per share for 2017 was $1.21 compared with $1.11 in 2016 year. The increase in net income compared with 2016 year was primarily due to an increase of $9.6 million in net interest income, an increase of $275,000 in noninterest income, and a decrease of $456,000 in provision for loan losses, partially offset by an increase of $4.5 million in provision for income tax and an increase of $3.4 million in noninterest expense.\nComparing quarterly results, net income in the fourth quarter of 2017 decreased $2.5 million, or 51.3%, to $2.3 million compared with $4.8 million in the previous quarter and decreased $2.0 million, or 45.8%, compared with $4.3 million in the year-ago quarter. Diluted earnings per share were $0.17 in the fourth quarter of 2017 compared with $0.35 in the previous quarter and $0.32 in the year-ago quarter. The decrease of $2.5 million in net income compared with the previous quarter is primarily due to the recognition of $1.6 million in additional tax expense attributed to a re-measurement of our deferred tax assets and liabilities, an increase of $1.1 million in provision for loan losses, and an increase of $661,000 in non-interest expense, partially offset by an increase of $550,000 in net interest income.\nNet Interest Income and Net Interest Margin\nNet interest income before provision for loan losses for 2017 increased $9.6 million, or 21.0%, to $55.2 million compared with $45.6 million in 2016 year. Net interest income before provision for loan losses in the fourth quarter of 2017 increased $550,000, or 3.8%, to $14.9 million compared with $14.4 million in the previous quarter, and increased $2.4 million, or 18.7%, compared with $12.6 million in the year-ago quarter. The increase in net interest income compared with the previous year and the previous quarters was primarily due to an increase in interest-earning assets and multiple increases in market interest rates since December 2016.\nInterest income on loans in 2017 increased $11.5 million, or 22.9%, to $61.5 million compared with $50.1 million in the previous year. The increase on interest income on loans compared with the 2016 year was primarily due to an increase in loan balance and an increase in loan yield. The average total loan balance, including loans held for sale (“LHFS”), was $1,111.2 million in 2017 compared with $961.5 million in 2016. Loan yield was 5.54% in 2017 and 5.21% in 2016.\nInterest income on loans increased $832,000, or 5.2%, to $16.8 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 compared with $16.0 million in the previous quarter and increased $3.0 million, or 22.0%, compared with $13.8 million in the year-ago quarter. The increase on interest income on loans compared with the previous quarters was primarily due to an increase in loan balance. The average total loan balance, including LHFS, was $1,186.0 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 compared with $1,123.7 million in the previous quarter, and $1,040.8 million in the year-ago quarter.

The average balance of investment securities in 2017 was $126.9 million, compared to $95.4 million for 2016, while the yield for 2017 was 2.06% compared to 1.83% for 2016.\nThe average balance of investment securities was $147.5 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 compared with $140.0 million in the previous quarter, and $95.7 million in the year-ago quarter.

The average balance of interest bearing liabilities was $868.6 million in 2017 compared with $729.2 million for 2016. The cost of funds increased primarily due to multiple increases in short term market interest rates since December 2016 combined with continuing competition for deposit customers. The cost of interest-bearing liabilities was 1.14% in 2017 compared with 0.96% in 2016. The cost of funds including non-interest bearing deposits was 0.85% in 2017 compared with 0.70% in 2016.\nTotal interest expense in the fourth quarter of 2017 increased $231,000, or 8.5%, to $2.9 million compared with $2.7 million in the previous quarter and increased $928,000, or 46.2%, compared with $2.0 million in the year-ago quarter.

The provision in the fourth quarter of 2017 was primarily due to an increase in charged-off loans and an increase in the size of the loan portfolio. The allowance for loan losses to gross loan ratio was 1.03% at December 31, 2017, 1.02% at September 30, 2017, and 1.10% at December 31, 2016.\nIn 2017, the Company recognized a net charge-off of $923,000 compared with a net charge-off of $309,000 in 2016.

The $2.9 million increase in salary and employee benefit expenses consisted of $728,000 due to an increase in employee headcount, $499,000 in annual salary adjustments, $973,000 in employee bonus and incentive expenses, $280,000 in employee payroll taxes, and $252,000 in employee group insurance expenses.\nNon-interest expenses in the fourth quarter of 2017 increased $661,000, or 7.4%, to $9.6 million compared with $9.0 million in the previous quarter and increased $1.5 million, or 19.2%, compared with $8.1 million in the year-ago quarter.

The Company’s effective income tax rate in 2017 was 47.66% compared with 42.62% in 2016. The effective income tax rate for the fourth quarter of 2017 and full year 2017 increased compared with the previous quarters and full year 2016 primarily due to a re-measurement of deferred tax assets and liability related to the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “Tax Reform Act”) on December 22, 2017. Beginning in 2018, the Tax Reform Act reduces the Federal tax rate for corporations from 35% to 21% and changes or limits certain tax deductions. As a result of the lower corporate tax rate, during the fourth quarter of 2017, the Company recorded a onetime revaluation adjustment of $1.6 million to reduce its deferred tax assets, which incurred income tax expense and reduced fourth quarter and full year earnings.\nBALANCE SHEET SUMMARY\nTotal Assets\nTotal assets increased $38.2 million, or 2.7%, to $1,442.0 million at December 31, 2017 compared with $1,403.8 million at September 30, 2017, and increased $215.4 million, or 17.6%, compared with $1,226.6 million at December 31, 2016.\nLoans\nTotal loans receivable including loans held-for-sale, net of deferred costs and fees, increased $46.1 million, or 4.0%, to $1,195.3 million at December 31, 2017 compared with $1,149.2 million at September 30, 2017, and increased $162.0 million, or 15.7%, compared with $1,033.3 million at December 31, 2016.\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2017, the Company originated $154.3 million in loans, sold $29.2 million of SBA guaranteed portion of the loans and $2.1 million in residential mortgage loans, recognized $75.7 million in loan principal paydown/payoff, and charged-off $1.2 million.

The decreases compared with the previous quarters was due to the recognition of valuation allowance and the sale of one OREO during the second quarter of 2017.\nThe tables below summarize composition of non-performing loans and non-performing assets:\nNon-performing loans composition (Dollars in thousands) Dec. 31, 2017\nSept. 30, 2017\nPercentage Change\nDec. 31, 2016\nPercentage Change\nReal estate loans $ 318 $ 330 -3.6 % $ 57 457.9 % Commercial and industrial loans 14 149 -90.6 % 284 -95.1 % SBA loans 2,148 1,006 113.5 % 1,468 46.3 % Home mortgage loans 730 - 0.0 % - 0.0 % Consumer loans & others 24 26 -7.7 % 39 -38.5 % $ 3,234 $ 1,511 114.0 % $ 1,848 75.0 % Non-performing assets (Dollars in thousands) Dec. 31, 2017\nSept. 30, 2017\n% Change\nDec. 31, 2016\n% Change\nNon-performing loans (NPL) $ 3,234 $ 1,511 114.0 % $ 1,848 75.0 % Non-performing TDR (included in NPL) 1,675 609 175.0 % 663 152.6 % Gross loans including deferred loan fees/cost 1,189,999 1,146,744 3.8 % 1,031,112 15.4 % NPL/Gross loans 0.27 % 0.13 % 0.18 % OREO $ 99 $ 141 -29.8 % $ 506 -80.4 % Performing TDR 592 1,676 -64.7 % 2,196 -73.0 % NPA (NPL+OREO) 3,333 1,652 101.8 % 2,353 41.6 % Total assets $ 1,441,998 $ 1,403,816 2.7 % $ 1,226,642 17.6 % NPA (NPL+OREO)/Gross loans 0.28 % 0.14 % 0.23 % NPA (NPL+OREO)/Total assets 0.23 % 0.12 % 0.19 % Classified Assets\nClassified loans decreased $835,000, or 14.4%, to $5.0 million compared with $5.8 million at September 30, 2017 and decreased $4.1 million, or 45.0%, compared with $9.1 million at December 31, 2016.
