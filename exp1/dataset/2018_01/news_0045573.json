The sell tender is for a cargo loading March 21-31 from the Mekar Bergading Marine Terminal. It will close on Thursday, with bids to remain valid until a day later. \nPetronas’ cargo is the second condensate export parcel from the new gas field in the Gulf of Thailand, trade sources said. \nField operator Hess Corp sold the first cargo to Thailand’s PTT Pcl for a December loading, they said. \nBergading, with an API gravity of 59 degrees, is one of the lighter condensates produced in Asia, one source said. \nThe North Malay Basin is comprised of nine discovered natural gas fields with an estimated gross recoverable resource of more than 1.5 trillion cubic feet of natural gas and more than 20 million barrels of condensate, Hess said on its website. \nThe North Malay Basin Block PM302, located about 300 kilometers offshore the Trengganu Gas Terminal in the Gulf of Thailand, started production in July last year, it said. \nGas output had been expected to reach its planned plateau rate of 165 million cubic feet per day in the fourth quarter of 2017, said Hess, which has a 50 percent interest in the block.
