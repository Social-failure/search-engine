Aug 17, 2017; Mason, OH, USA;   returns a shot against Caroline Wozniacki (DEN) during the Western and Southern Open at the Lindner Family Tennis Center. Aaron Doster-USA TODAY Sports \nGiorgi, belying her ranking of world number 100, had defeated U.S. Open champion Sloane Stephens in the first round, ousted twice Wimbledon and former Sydney champion Petra Kvitova and raced past Agnieszka Radwanska 6-1 6-2 in the last eight. \nBut Kerber, currently ranked 22nd in the world after a disappointing 2017 campaign, proved too strong for Giorgi despite the Italian racing to a 3-0 lead in the second set. \nThe 29-year-old Kerber, who won the Australian and U.S. Open titles in 2016, was resolute in defence against her aggressive opponent and advanced to a first individual final since Monterrey in April last year. \nAwaiting the German in the final will be Ashleigh Barty, who overcame a slow start to win her all-Australian semi-final against Daria Gavrilova 3-6 6-4 6-2. \n“I just tried to play my tennis like I’ve played the last years and I‘m so happy to be in the final in the first tournament of the year,” Kerber said in a court-side interview. \n“She’s (Giorgi) beaten a lot of good players this week and so I was just trying to get a lot of balls back. I‘m very happy with my performance.” \nThe 21-year-old Barty needed one hour, 58 minutes to see off the challenge of Russian-born Gavrilova as both players struggled to hold serve throughout the match. \nBarty held just once in the first set but reversed the momentum in the second when she broke in the ninth game after Gavrilova double faulted twice, which prompted the 23-year-old to smash her racquet in frustration and earn a code violation. \nBarty then broke early in the decider and again in the seventh game to finally pull away for the win. \n”I certainly shot myself in the foot with my serve today,“ she said. ”But happy to get through in the end and get another opportunity tomorrow. \n“It’s been a pleasure playing here this week.” \nGavrilova was playing her third successive Australian opponent in Sydney. \nShe had already beaten Olivia Rogowska in the first round and former U.S. Open champion Sam Stosur in the second and advanced to the semi-finals after Wimbledon champion Garbine Muguruza withdrew with a hip injury. \nIn the men’s section, Australian teenager Alex de Minaur booked his spot in the final after rallying to beat Benoit Paire of France 4-6 6-1 6-1 in one hour and 50 minutes. \nDe Minaur, ranked 167 in the world, became the youngest ATP World Tour finalist since American Taylor Fritz at Memphis 2016 and the 18-year-old will now take on Russian qualifier Daniil Medvedev in the final. \nMedvedev defeated Italian fourth seed Fabio Fognini 2-6 6-4 6-1 in the day’s first semi-final.
