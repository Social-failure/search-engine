Byron easily put it away to break a 1-1 tie with 9:19 left in the game.\nThe third period did not start well for Montreal as it came up empty on two power plays and hit the post three times in the first eight minutes. However, the Canadiens finally got a break on the Byron goal.\nPacioretty added an empty-net goal with 1:18 left that gave Montreal a 3-1 lead. Lars Eller then scored for Washington with 54 seconds remaining but the Canadiens held on.\nBoth teams turned to their back-up goalies in this contest. Antti Niemi started for Montreal for the first time since a Dec. 23 loss to Edmonton and earned his first victory this season. He was 0-1-1 in four games, including two starts with the Canadiens, and 0-5-1 overall with three teams this season.\nNiemi posted 24 saves in the victory.\nGrubauer had been hot of late for Washington and played well once again with 23 saves in the loss. He is 4-1-2 in his last seven appearances.\nWashington now has lost two games in two nights, having fallen to New Jersey in a road contest on Thursday.\nThe Canadiens took a 1-0 lead just 14 seconds after Washington’s Tom Wilson was whistled for hooking when Pacioretty beat Grubauer on a quick wrist shot at 7:08 of the second period.\nWashington tied it later in the period on a John Carlson power-play goal with 6:36 left.\nIn off-the-ice news, Red Fisher, who covered the Canadiens from 1955 until 2012, died on Friday at the age of 91. Fisher received numerous honors, including the Hockey Hall of Fame’s Elmer Ferguson Memorial Award.\n-- Field Level Media\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-01-20T11:37:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-20T17:30:16.005+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
