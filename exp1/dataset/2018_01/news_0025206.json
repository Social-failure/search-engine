Alexis Pinturault of France is third on 579.\nHirscher has won eight races altogether this season, with the other three in giant slalom.\nWriting by Brian Homewood; Editing by Toby Davis\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-01-14T21:41:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-15T16:56:48.007+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
