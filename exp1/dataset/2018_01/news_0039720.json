Instead, it will seek in the coming months a “strategic buyer” for the shares and it expects leading exchanges around the world to show interest.\nSuch a tie-up would strengthen the Tel Aviv exchange’s competitive standing globally, it said.\nBank Leumi ( LUMI.TA ), First International Bank of Israel ( FTIN.TA ), Bank of Jerusalem ( JBNK.TA ) and Union Bank ( UNON.TA ) put out statements that they had agreed to sell all or most of their shares.\nThe exchange demutualised and became for-profit in September as part of a plan to boost trading volumes and company listings.\n($1 = 3.4146 shekels)\nReporting by Ari Rabinovitch; Editing by Tova Cohen\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-01-21T20:59:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-21T17:18:33.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
