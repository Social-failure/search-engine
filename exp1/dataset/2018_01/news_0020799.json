The U.S. are our second home. We will continue to invest significant amounts of money in this market and we are optimistic that the NAFTA agreement will be adapted in a very positive way,” finance chief Nicolas Peter said at a round table at the Detroit auto show. \nCanada last week welcomed U.S. President Donald Trump’s suggestion that talks to modernise NAFTA could be extended beyond the end-March deadline, a move which might help break a deadlock at the negotiations. \nPeter also said BMW group’s unit sales would likely grow between 0 and 5 percent worldwide this year and 5-10 percent in China, thanks to a raft of new models, especially SUVS.
