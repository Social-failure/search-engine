Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas speaks during the meeting of the Palestinian Central Council in the West Bank city of Ramallah January 14, 2018. REUTERS/Mohamad Torokman \nThe Palestinians are seething at U.S. President Donald Trump’s recognition last month of Jerusalem as Israel’s capital and Abbas told a meeting of senior Palestinian officials in a speech that the move had disqualified the United States as a peacemaker. \nIsrael says it would welcome the United States as a mediator but a U.S. bid to revive negotiations, led by Trump’s adviser and son-in-law, Jared Kushner, has so far shown no progress. Talks have been frozen since 2014. \nTrump has said that achieving an agreement would be the “deal of the century” but Abbas was scathing on Sunday, saying: “The deal of the century is actually the slap of the century, and we will return it.” \n“We do not accept the United States as a mediator between us and Israel,” Abbas said. “Let it be an international committee formed at an international conference comprising four or five (countries or parties). But the United States alone? No.” \nAbbas’s comments were made at the start of a two-day meeting in Ramallah of the Palestinian Central Council, the Palestinians’ highest decision-making body, where 95 delegates will debate future strategy. \n“WILL NOT ACCEPT U.S. MEDIATION” Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas speaks during the meeting of the Palestinian Central Council in the West Bank city of Ramallah January 14, 2018. REUTERS/Mohamad Torokman \n“We will not accept anything the United States may try to impose on us and we will not accept its mediation following that crime,” said Abbas, referring to Trump’s Jerusalem decision. \nPalestinian officials have said they will not meet U.S. Vice President Mike Pence when he visits Egypt, Jordan and Israel this month.

The Palestinians want East Jerusalem as the capital of their future state. \nIsrael captured East Jerusalem in the 1967 Middle East war and annexed it in a move never recognised internationally. \n“Jerusalem was taken off the table by a tweet from Mr. Trump. Because of that we are meeting now, because there is nothing more important than Jerusalem,” Abbas said.
