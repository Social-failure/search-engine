It’s not about just one of us. It’s about ALL of us. Which is why your name deserves to be displayed during Tuesday night’s speech.” It invites donors to choose how much money to give—ranging from the minimum of $35, to a maximum of $2,700, which is the limit allowed per election. \nThe text message version of the solicitation adds another message : “Enough of the Fake News Media. It’s time for them to hear from the AMERICAN PEOPLE.” Trump campaign’s livestream of State of the Union speech will display campaign donors’ names on screen. pic.twitter.com/FyF9QaLZSh \n— Derek Willis (@derekwillis) January 29, 2018 \nThis isn’t the first time Trump has promised to put donor names on the big screen. During the GOP convention, Trump’s campaign had a “ Your Name on a Jumbotron ” offer for those who donated $50 or more. \nThe State of the Union is scheduled for 9 p.m. EST on Tuesday.
