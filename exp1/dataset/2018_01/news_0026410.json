In 2017, Adidas announced it had stepped away from TV advertising as its consumers went online , while website company Wix has no plans to spend money on TV this year, in spite of advertising during the last three Super Bowl broadcasts.\nHalf of all global ad dollars will be spent online by 2020, according to an estimate by media agency Magna, matching all combined \"offline\" ad spend, including TV .\nMars spends around 30 percent of its ad budgets on digital means for its candy and food business, which includes brands like Skittles, M&Ms and Dolmio. Digital spend is higher in petcare because it's easier to identify people who own an animal.\nSource: Mars \"We can get much more targeted now with data and really understanding consumers in new and different ways. What breed of dog or cat might they have (or) their feeding patterns (for example), and therefore make sure the messages that we give them through a marketing perspective are relevant,\" Clarke said.\nMars still wants to reach a mass audience for its candy business. \"But we'll continue to test and learn. We'll continue to experiment. We'll continue to use digital across all of our channels and then we'll put our dollars in the places that give us the best possible return,\" he said.\nMars mixes a scientific approach to marketing with a focus on creativity. It works with the Ehrenberg-Bass Institute for Marketing Science to understand the return on investment of its ad dollars and won 44 times at the Cannes Lions ad awards in 2017. The many ways to promote its brands to people mean it has never been a more challenging and disruptive time to be a marketer, Clarke told CNBC .", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-16T18:12:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-16T18:15:18.021+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
