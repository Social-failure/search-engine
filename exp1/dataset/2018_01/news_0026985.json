However, it said it would never do anything to intentionally shorten the life of any Apple product.\nApple will release a software update that will allow users to turn off a feature that slows down iPhones when batteries are low on charge, CEO Cook told ABC News on Wednesday.\nItaly’s antitrust body said on Thursday it had opened a probe into allegations that Apple and Samsung Electronics Co Ltd used software updates to slow their mobile phones and push clients into buying new handsets.\nA French prosecutor has also launched a preliminary investigation into Apple’s alleged deception and planned obsolescence of its products.\nReporting by Ju-min Park; Editing by Himani Sarkar\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-19T05:58:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-19T06:14:33.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
