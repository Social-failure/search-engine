On top of that we have the effects of demographics and the population ageing,” Ravi Menon said at an Institute of Policy Studies event.\n“The willingness of a society...to pay in taxes to support those less well off is quite critical. You see this in the small European countries and they do this quite well. And I think this is one of the existential questions we have to face.”\nSingapore has some of the lowest tax rates in the world but government officials have signaled the need for higher taxes to support future social spending and infrastructure needs. Changes may be unveiled as soon as the Feb. 19 budget, analysts say.\nA survey published last week showed Singaporeans were not in favor of higher taxes to support their elderly and would prefer the country to tap its national reserves to deal with future social spending increases.\nReporting by John Geddie and Masayuki Kitano; Editing by Sam Holmes\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-01-22T11:31:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-22T05:47:52.027+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
