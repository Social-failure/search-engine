Reuters has not independently verified any of the allegations. \nMPR fired Keillor, 75, in November. The Minneapolis Star Tribune reported at the time that Keillor told it in an email that the behavior involved him inadvertently putting his hand on a woman’s bare back, for which he said he apologized. \nThe station issued a statement in November saying, “Minnesota Public Radio (MPR) is terminating its contracts with Garrison Keillor and his private media companies after learning of allegations of his inappropriate behavior with an individual who worked with him.” It gave no details. \nThe humorist and author created the folksy “Prairie Home” variety show and hosted it for more than four decades. \nDozens of high-profile men have been fired or have resigned from jobs in politics, media, entertainment and business in recent months after facing accusations of sexual misconduct.
