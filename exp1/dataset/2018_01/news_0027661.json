Dividends are planned, but not guaranteed, for each subsequent month. The anticipated monthly dividend rate is $0.11 per share ($1.32 per share on an annualized basis). This action is being taken in order to align AMZA’s distributions to shareholders more closely with its distributable cash flow.\nEdward F. Ryan, Chief Financial Officer of Infrastructure Capital Advisors, LLC, commented: “Many AMZA shareholders utilize the fund as a part of an income-seeking strategy. Such investors have expressed a strong preference for consistent, monthly distributions.\n“At the new payment schedule and rate,” Ryan continued, “the fund is positioned to make substantial cash distributions to its shareholders while minimizing potential net capital distributions. The new dividend rate is set at a level that we think can be consistently covered by the fund’s distributable cash flow. It was determined after consideration of the average yield of midstream MLP sector stocks and the fund’s use of leverage and option strategies to generate an enhanced level of income for distribution.”\nInvestors should note that a portion of the fund’s distributions may be categorized as return of capital.

The costs of owning the ETF may exceed the cost of investing directly in the underlying securities.\nMLP Interest Rates: As yield-based investments, MLPs carry interest rate risk and may underperform in rising interest rate environments. Additionally, when investors have heightened fears about the economy, the risk spread between MLPs and competing investment options can widen, which may have an adverse effect on the stock price of MLPs. Rising interest rates may increase the potential cost of MLPs financing projects or cost of operations, and may affect the demand for MLP investments, either of which may result in lower performance by or distributions from the Fund’s MLP investments.\nIndustry/Sector Concentration: A fund that focuses its investments in a particular industry or sector will be more sensitive to conditions that affect that industry or sector than a non-concentrated fund.\nShort Sales: The fund may engage in short sales, and may experience a loss if the price of a borrowed security increases before the date on which the fund replaces the security.\nLeverage: When a fund leverages its portfolio, the value of its shares may be more volatile and all other risks may be compounded.\nDerivatives: Investments in derivatives such as futures, options, forwards, and swaps may increase volatility or cause a loss greater than the principal investment.\nMLPs: Investments in Master Limited Partnerships may be adversely impacted by tax law changes, regulation, or factors affecting underlying assets.\nNo Guarantee: There is no guarantee that the portfolio will meet its objective.\nYou should consider the fund’s investment objectives, risks, and charges and expenses carefully before investing.
