Aaron White, one of the study’s authors, suggests that one hypothesis might be that there’s an increase in risky drinking behaviors. \nThere was also a higher rate of ER visits during the time period amongst women specifically. Women are catching up to men when it comes to things like drunk driving, binge drinking, and deaths from cirrhosis of the liver due to alcoholism. \nAnd it’s not a cheap problem. A 2010 study found that excessive drinking costs an estimated $249 billion a year.
