The document has since become the focus of attacks by Trump and his supporters.\nFusion’s lawyers complained that the names of Fusion employees were publicly disclosed in six letters issued last week by Grassley and Senator Graham, a judiciary subcommittee chairman, although the company’s lawyers “on multiple occasions” had asked committee staff members to avoid doing so.\n“Ignoring our requests, your office knowingly put these people in danger, by releasing their names to the public,” the Fusion lawyers argued. “These leaks are unauthorised and unethical.”\n“Some of these employees are not yet 30 years old. Others have children. We also hope that nothing happens to these good people, simply because of your office’s laboured efforts to defend this president or please the editorial pages of the Wall Street Journal.”\nThe lawyers for Fusion also accused Grassley’s office of leaking confidential information it obtained from Fusion GPS and its founder, former Journal reporter Glenn Simpson.\nA spokesman for Senator Dianne Feinstein, the top Democrat on the Judiciary Committee, did not respond to requests for comment. The offices of other senators, including Grassley and Graham, also did not respond.\nBut a Judiciary Committee spokesman said the letter from Fusion’s attorneys contained “a number of inaccuracies that misrepresent the facts.”\nReporting By Mark Hosenball; Editing by John Walcott and Tom Brown\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-30T01:52:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-30T02:17:22.013+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
