U.S. gold futures for February delivery were flat at $1,321.50.\nThe metal remains on track for a fourth straight weekly gain, however, for the first time since April. It has risen nearly 1 percent in the first trading week of the year, having climbed by 13 percent in 2017.\nThat has left gold looking overstretched, ABN Amro analyst Georgette Boele said. \"I think when the rest of the market returns, gold prices will be lower and the U.S. dollar will recover.\"\nThe dollar see-sawed in the wake of data showing U.S. job growth slowed more than expected last month, before turning higher.

Related headlines should eventually cool sentiment, trigger profit-taking and lead to a price correction,\" said Baer.\nSpot silver vacillated around $17.23 after touching its highest point in more than six weeks at $17.27 in the previous session.\nSpot platinum was 0.99 percent higher at $969.20 an ounce.
