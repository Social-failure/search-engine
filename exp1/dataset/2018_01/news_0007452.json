Merkel, who in November failed to form a coalition with the Greens and the pro-business Free Democrats (FDP), said on Sunday at the start of five days of talks with the SPD that the negotiations could succeed.\nMembers of her conservative party sounded similarly upbeat on Monday.\n“Yesterday, we worked very factually and we did well,” said Julia Kloeckner, a senior member of the CDU. “We are aware of the fiscal limitations and we are optimistic.”\nSPD leader Martin Schulz has vowed to put any agreement with the conservatives up for a vote by party members, many of whom are opposed to a so-called ‘grand coalition’ of the two largest parties in parliament.\nThe SPD want to improve the right of workers and scrap Germany’s dual healthcare system of premium private care and more widely accessible public care to replace it with a single “citizen’s insurance”.\nThey also oppose a plan by the conservatives to extend a ban that expires in March on family reunifications for some asylum seekers.\nWriting by Joseph Nasr, Editing by William Maclean\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-08T11:21:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-08T11:44:55.003+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
