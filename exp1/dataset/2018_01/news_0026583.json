The farming association president Joachim Rukwied said glyphosate opponents were undertaking “a campaign of fear.”\nRukwied said opponents of glyphosate had failed to show scientific cause for concern. A ban would cause a massive competitive disadvantage to German farmers, who would face the extra costs of additional ploughing to control weeds, he said.\nReporting by Hans-Edzard Busemann; Writing by Michael Hogan; Editing by Edmund Blair\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-18T16:58:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-18T17:15:38.018+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
