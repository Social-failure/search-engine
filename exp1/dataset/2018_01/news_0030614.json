REUTERS/David Gray/File Photo \nThe two Koreas competed separately in the 2000 games with their own flags and national anthems, as well as in the subsequent Olympics. \nIn 2007, a large “unification” flag was displayed at the border when then-South Korean president Roh Moo-hyun walked into North Korea for a summit with former North Korean leader Kim Jong Il. \nHowever, the flag has not been seen at a high-profile public event since 2008, when South Korea’s conservative Lee Myung-bak administration took power. Relations chilled dramatically in 2010 after the sinking of a South Korean warship that the South blamed on the North. Pyongyang denied any involvement, but the relationship has continued to suffer as the North accelerated its nuclear and missile programmes in defiance of U.N. sanctions. \nAlthough the two Koreas have agreed to compete together and use the single flag at the Pyeongchang Winter Olympics, the matter has not been finalised, an official from the games’ organising committee told Reuters. \nSouth and North Korean representatives will discuss the matter with the International Olympic Committee (IOC) when they meet on Saturday in Lausanne, Switzerland. \nAlthough some South Koreans oppose using the flag instead of South Korea’s “Taegukgi” flag at the Pyeongchang Olympics, the flag is still a powerful symbol of peace, said Jang Man-jae, the owner of a company that makes the unification flag. \n“Although ideologies are different, the flag can give us a sense of unity, which is a good thing,” said Jang. \n“I would feel uncomfortable making North Korea’s national flag but this flag, I can definitely keep making it.” Editing by Soyoung Kim and Lincoln Feast", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-18T09:51:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-18T10:06:36.149+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
