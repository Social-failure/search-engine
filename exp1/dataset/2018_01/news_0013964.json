The broader PwC entity handles consulting, tax advisory and other businesses. \n“The SEBI order relates to a fraud that took place nearly a decade ago in which we played no part and had no knowledge of,” Price Waterhouse said in a release. \n“There has been no intentional wrong doing by PW firms in the unprecedented management perpetrated fraud at Satyam, nor have we seen any material evidence to the contrary,” said Price Waterhouse, adding it was confident of getting a court to stay the order before it becomes effective. \nTo avoid operational difficulties, SEBI said its order will not impact audit assignments relating to the ongoing 2017-18 financial year, already undertaken by firms forming part of the PW network. \nSEBI also ordered Price Waterhouse, Bangalore and two of its erstwhile partners to jointly forfeit “wrongful gains” of about 131 million rupees ($2.06 million) plus interest within 45 days. \nIndian IT firm Tech Mahindra, part of the Mahindra Group, bought control of Satyam in an auction in April 2010. \nSatyam and PricewaterhouseCoopers agreed in 2011 to pay a combined $17.5 million to settle U.S. probes into the accounting fraud.
