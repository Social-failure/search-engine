She also said exceptions could be made to the suspension. \n“Today we can confirm that we are suspending ... security assistance only to Pakistan at this time until the Pakistani government takes decisive action against groups including the Afghan Taliban and the Haqqani network. We consider them to be destabilizing the region and also targeting U.S. personnel,” State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert told a regular news briefing.
