Amazon-owned Audible, the top provider of audiobooks, has not been supported on Home and other speakers with Google Assistant. \nGoogle launching an audiobooks store widens the battle, which has also seen Google’s YouTube unit stop supporting an Amazon product. \nGreg Hartrell, head of product management for Google Play Books, listed subscription-less buying as the top selling point for the new audiobooks store. \n“You can buy a single audiobook at an affordable price, with no commitments,” he said in a blog post on Tuesday. \nAudible offers one-off purchases, but promotes a $14.95 monthly subscription that includes one free download and 30 percent off further purchases. Amazon and Audible did not respond to requests to comment. \nGoogle began selling ebooks in 2010. Hartrell told Reuters in a statement that audiobooks are being added because “our users are asking for them.” \nAbout 16 percent of U.S. adults own a smart speaker, according to an Edison Research survey conducted in late 2017. The firm in conjunction with Triton Digital also found last spring that 30 percent of frequent audiobook listeners had used a smart speaker to take in an audiobook in the previous 12 months. \nAudiobook sales surged nearly 20 percent annually for three consecutive years, reaching $2.1 billion in 2016, according to the latest Audio Publishers Assn. data. \nThad McIlroy, an online book industry consultant, said audiobooks represent the only publishing category with “strong growth” so it makes sense for Google to challenge Amazon despite having a weak ebooks business. \nGoogle-purchased audiobooks can be accessed through Google Play Books on the web, apps for Android and iOS devices or through Google Assistant in speakers, Android smartphones and “soon” cars with Android Auto, Hartrell wrote.
