Reports from survivors and government officials varied between 35 and 100 people.

The eight were rescued by a fishing vessel. \nThey told rescuers they had scrambled into their tiny dinghy as the ferry disintegrated soon after setting off and that other passengers had made it into another dinghy and a liferaft. \nThe second dinghy had broken up and likely sunk, Craven said, with the search was now focusing on finding the liferaft. \nHe said rescuers’ main concern was that any survivors would be facing the heat for days without drinking water.
