The farming association president Joachim Rukwied said glyphosate opponents were undertaking \"a campaign of fear.\" \nRukwied said opponents of glyphosate had failed to show scientific cause for concern. A ban would cause a massive competitive disadvantage to German farmers, who would face the extra costs of additional ploughing to control weeds, he said. \n(Reporting by Hans-Edzard Busemann; Writing by Michael Hogan; Editing by Edmund Blair)", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-18T16:53:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-19T00:19:12.007+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
