On Friday there was no new major outbreak of violence in the country, relieving some of the tension from the market.\nshow chapters Oil prices to drop by Oscar season, OPIS' Tom Kloza warns      22 Hours Ago | 01:27 U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures ended Friday's session down 57 cents, or nearly 1 percent, at $61.44 a barrel, falling from the $62.21 May 2015 high reached the previous day.\nBrent crude futures fell 45 cents to $67.62 a barrel. The contract jumped to $68.27 in the previous session, also the highest since May 2015.\nOil prices have received general support from production cuts led by OPEC and Russia, which started in January last year and are set to last through 2018, as well as from strong economic growth and financial markets.\nThat has helped to tighten markets. U.S. commercial crude inventories fell by 7.4 million barrels in the week to Dec. 29, to 424.46 million barrels, according to data from the Energy Information Administration.\nThat is down 20 percent from peaks last March and close to the five-year average of 420 million barrels.\nYet, surging U.S. production could offset some of the cuts from OPEC producers, as U.S. production rose to 9.78 million barrels a day in the latest week, according to Wednesday's report.\nDrillers reduced the number of oil rigs operating in fields by 5 to 742 in the week to Jan. 5. That was 213 more than the 529 rigs in the year-ago period, General Electric Co's Baker Hughes energy services firm said on Friday.\nshow chapters Rising commodity prices due to investment increase: Commerzbank      8 Hours Ago | 04:08 The U.S. oil rig count rose by about 42 percent by end-2017 compared to the levels seen during the corresponding period in 2016, as energy companies boosted spending amid a recovery in crude prices. \nGiven that Iran's oil production has not been affected by the unrest, and that U.S. production will likely break through 10 million barrels per day (bpd) soon, a level so far only reached by Saudi Arabia and Russia, doubts are emerging whether the bull-run can last.\nBank Jefferies said the oil price \"upside from here is not obvious to us\" but added that it expects the oil market to remain undersupplied through 2018.\nJulius Baer's Ruecker said that crude prices above $60 project an \"overly rosy picture.\"\n\"Oil production disruptions (in Iran) remain a very distant threat ...Disruptions in the North Sea have been removed with the Forties Pipeline system having resumed full operations. U.S. oil production surpassed the 2015 highs in October and is set to climb to historic highs this year,\" he said.\nLukman Otunuga, analyst at futures brokerage FXTM, struck a similarly cautious tone, saying: \"While the current momentum suggests that further upside is on the cards, it must be kept in mind that U.S. shale remains a threat to higher oil prices.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-05T08:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-05T07:34:25.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
