Executive to Drive Continued Innovation for AI-Powered Endpoint Security Solution to Keep Customers Ahead of the Latest Cybersecurity Threats\nMOUNTAIN VIEW, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- SentinelOne , the pioneer in autonomous AI-powered security for the endpoint, today announced that David Ginat, formerly of Intel Corp., has been named Vice President of Research and Development. Ginat will lead SentinelOne’s R&D operations in Israel, where he’ll be responsible for building new, innovative product features in the SentinelOne platform, empowering the company’s more than 2,000 customers to protect, detect, respond and remediate attacks from a single, converged platform.\n“David’s experience at Intel demonstrates that he is adept in building and delivering large scale projects required for today’s enterprise environments,” said Tomer Weingarten, CEO for SentinelOne. “He is also a skilled leader who excels at building high-performing teams and delivering product excellence. Given the fast pace and critical nature of the cybersecurity landscape, David has the right skillset to lead R&D for SentinelOne as we shape the network of the future.”\nPrior to joining SentinelOne, Ginat spent more than a decade at Intel Corp., serving in a number of critical roles. Most recently, he was Director of Software Development and Testing, Wearables and IoT Platforms. In this role, Ginat built the software development and product validation organization from scratch and created the strategy and product roadmap architecture for the newly formed organization. He also developed and delivered a critical IoT SDK, delivering a full platform stack, including platform management and security. Ginat also served six years in the Israeli Defense Force’s elite cyber security unit as one of its leading Research & Development managers.\n“SentinelOne has built a unique AI-powered solution to prevent, detect and thwart cyberattacks from both known and unknown sources,” said Ginat. “I am looking forward to the opportunity to extend the platform and create powerful, innovative and scalable solutions to continuously outmaneuver attackers, so businesses can operate free from threats and without intrusive, and often times ineffective, security measures.”\nSentinelOne Continues Rapid Growth, Exceeds 2,000 Customer Deployments\nThe Ginat appointment continues the record growth SentinelOne experienced in 2017. Highlights in the past year include:\nIn June 2017, Nicholas Warner joined the company as Chief Revenue Officer from Cylance. Under his leadership, the company increased bookings by over 300 percent year-over-year, while increasing the year-over-year customer base 370 percent to more than 2,000 customer deployments. 2017 bookings from enterprise customers grew 359 percent. The company closed $70M series C to meet growing demand to replace traditional antivirus. SentinelOne continued to expand globally, adding sales teams across the U.S., Canada, U.K., Europe, Middle East and Asia Pacific regions. The company increased its employee base 175 percent over 2017. SentinelOne also continued to add strategic technology partners, including SonicWall, Splunk, LogRhythm, Fortinet, Demisto, Phantom, and others.\n“With the constant barrage of cybersecurity attacks, we understand the importance of helping our customers stay ahead of threats to their business,” said Warner. “As such, we continue to invest in building and delivering innovative new products that not only protect customers, but enable SentinelOne to build a lasting company on strong fundamentals. We are experiencing significant momentum in our business and customer base, in addition to recruiting high-quality partners to accelerate our go-to market strategy. Based on this year’s accomplishments, we are confident that we have the right products, the right team, and the right strategy to deliver an even better 2018.”\nAbout SentinelOne\nSentinelOne is shaping the future of endpoint security through its unified, converged platform that automatically prevents, detects, and responds to threats in real-time.
