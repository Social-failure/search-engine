The closing of the offering is expected to occur on January 17, 2018 and is subject to customary closing conditions. The Company intends to use the net proceeds of this offering for general corporate and working capital purposes.\nThe Notes will be senior, unsecured obligations of the Company and will bear interest at a rate of 1.0% per annum. Interest on the Notes will be payable semi-annually in arrears on January 15 and July 15 of each year, beginning July 15, 2018. The Notes will be convertible into cash, shares of the Company's common stock (plus, if applicable, cash in lieu of any fractional share), or a combination thereof, at the Company's election.
