Our lending efforts, including the additions of public finance and healthcare finance in 2017, had a solid year, which fueled record net interest income. In total, we grew loans by $840 million, or 67%, on a year-over-year basis.\n“Credit quality remains very strong. Additionally, our capital, following a common stock offering completed in the third quarter, positions us well to continue to win new customer relationships across the organization in 2018.”\nFourth quarter net income was $3.5 million and diluted earnings per share were $0.41. This compares with third quarter net income of $4.9 million and diluted earnings per share of $0.71 and fourth quarter 2016 net income of $3.7 million and diluted earnings per share of $0.64.\nFor the twelve month period ended December 31, 2017, net income was a record $15.2 million and diluted earnings per share were $2.13 compared to net income of $12.1 million and diluted earnings per share of $2.30 for the twelve month period ended December 31, 2016.\nAs a result of the “Tax Cuts and Jobs Act Bill of 2017,” the Company’s net deferred tax asset (“net DTA”) was revalued as of December 31, 2017. The value of the net DTA was reduced by $1.8 million with the amount of the reduction recognized as additional income tax expense in the fourth quarter. Consequently, this revaluation decreased fourth quarter diluted earnings per share by $0.22 and full year 2017 diluted earnings per share by $0.26.\nAdjusted for the net DTA revaluation, fourth quarter net income was $5.3 million and diluted earnings per share were $0.63 and full year 2017 net income was $17.1 million and diluted earnings per share were $2.39.\nThe Company completed its first sale of single tenant lease financing loans during the fourth quarter which included $24.7 million of loans. The Company is in the process of executing additional single tenant lease financing loan sales with approximately $27.8 million of loans transferred to loans-held-for-sale as of December 31, 2017 in anticipation of these transactions closing during the first quarter 2018. The loan sales provide the Company an additional strategy to manage balance sheet growth and capital while providing additional liquidity and further diversifying revenue channels.\nHighlights for the fourth quarter include:\nTotal loan growth of $222.7 million, or 11.9%, compared to September 30, 2017 and $840.4 million, or 67.2%, compared to December 31, 2016 Net interest income of $15.4 million, increasing $1.2 million, or 8.2%, compared to the linked quarter and $4.5 million, or 40.9%, compared to the fourth quarter 2016 Solid profitability after eliminating the impact of the net DTA revaluation\nAs Reported Adjusted Return on average assets 0.52% 0.80% Return on average shareholders’ equity 6.23% 9.52% Return on average tangible common equity 6.37% 9.73% Capital levels continued to support the strong balance sheet growth\nCompany Bank Total shareholders’ equity to assets 8.10% 8.07% Tangible common equity to tangible assets 7.94% 7.91% Tier 1 leverage ratio 8.45% 8.42% Common equity tier 1 capital ratio 11.43%\n11.40%\nTier 1 capital ratio 11.43%\n11.40%\nTotal risk-based capital ratio 14.07%\n12.16%\nAsset quality remained strong Nonperforming loans to total loans declined to 0.04% Nonperforming assets to total assets declined to 0.21%\nNet Interest Income and Net Interest Margin\nNet interest income for the fourth quarter was $15.4 million compared to $14.2 million for the third quarter and $10.9 million for the fourth quarter 2016. Total interest income for the fourth quarter was $24.6 million, increasing $1.9 million, or 8.6%, compared to the third quarter and $7.9 million, or 47.0%, compared to the fourth quarter 2016. The increase in total interest income compared to the linked quarter was driven primarily by a $175.9 million, or 9.8%, increase in average loan balances. Additionally, the yield earned on the loan portfolio increased 4 bps to 4.17% in the fourth quarter from 4.13% for the third quarter. The increase in the yield earned on the loan portfolio was driven by yield expansion in several loan types and also benefitted from the collection of back interest on a nonaccrual loan that paid down in full during the quarter. In total, the Company’s yield on interest-earning assets increased 8 bps during the fourth quarter to 3.78% from 3.70% for the third quarter.\nTotal interest expense for the fourth quarter was $9.3 million, increasing $0.8 million, or 9.1%, compared to the third quarter and $3.4 million, or 58.3%, compared to the fourth quarter 2016. The increase in total interest expense compared to the linked quarter was due primarily to an increase of $123.5 million, or 6.7%, in average interest-bearing deposit balances as well as an increase in the cost of funds related to interest-bearing deposits, which increased 7 bps during the fourth quarter to 1.49% from 1.42% for the third quarter. Overall, the total cost of interest-bearing liabilities increased 6 bps during the fourth quarter to 1.55% from 1.49% for the third quarter.\nNet interest margin (“NIM”) was 2.35% for the fourth quarter compared to 2.31% for the third quarter and 2.42% for the fourth quarter 2016. On a fully-taxable equivalent basis, NIM increased to 2.59% for the fourth quarter compared to 2.52% for the third quarter and 2.48% for the fourth quarter 2016.\nNoninterest Income\nNoninterest income for the fourth quarter was $2.5 million compared to $3.1 million for the third quarter and $2.9 million for the fourth quarter 2016. The decrease of $0.6 million, or 19.0%, compared to the linked quarter was due primarily to a decline of $1.0 million, or 39.6%, in mortgage banking revenue. The decrease in mortgage banking revenue was driven by lower mortgage origination activity as well as a decline in gain on sale margins related to mandatory commitments. The decrease in mortgage banking revenue was partially offset by a gain of $0.4 million on the sale of single tenant lease financing loans as discussed above.\nNoninterest Expense\nNoninterest expense for the fourth quarter was $9.7 million compared to $9.4 million for the third quarter and $8.2 million for the fourth quarter 2016. The increase of $0.3 million, or 3.2%, compared to the linked quarter was due primarily to increases in salaries and employee benefits and other expenses, offset by declines in marketing expenses and consulting and professional fees. The increase in salaries and benefits was due to higher incentive compensation related to loan origination activities and employee benefit expenses. The increase in other expenses was due primarily to costs associated with a residential mortgage property classified as other real estate owned.\nIncome Taxes\nIncome tax expense was $3.5 million for the fourth quarter, resulting in an ", "external_links": ["http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180118006413/en/", "http://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.firstinternetbancorp.com&esheet=51744429&newsitemid=20180118006413&lan=en-US&anchor=www.firstinternetbancorp.com&index=2&md5=a8c8b0c312053f8d1ab23483e96e6f58", "http://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.firstib.com&esheet=51744429&newsitemid=20180118006413&lan=en-US&anchor=www.firstib.com&index=1&md5=02b0c5bc7fa0b792f19ba870d26f0c2c", "http://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.firstib.com&esheet=51744429&newsitemid=20180118006413&lan=en-US&anchor=www.firstib.com&index=3&md5=fac7a06b1471dc3b6b6ba4a002b7ae51"], "published": "2018-01-19T00:44:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-19T00:21:17.001+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
