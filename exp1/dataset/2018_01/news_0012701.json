It gave no further details on the price increases.\nThe company’s shares hit a record high in Hong Kong on Friday on press reports that brewers, including China Resources and rival Tsingtao Brewery Co Ltd, raised some prices from Jan. 1 citing rising costs of materials, labour, transportation and for environmental protection.\nA stronger pricing environment in China is also good news for European alcoholic drinks companies, said Liberum analysts, pointing out that Carlsberg, Anheuser-Busch InBev , Remy Cointreau and Pernod Ricard boast the highest China sales.\nTsingtao Brewery, the maker of China’s best known Tsingtao beer, said on Friday that it had raised product prices by up to 5 percent, in a bid to offset pressure from higher costs of production and raw materials.\nChinese liquor maker Kweichow Moutai said last month it planned to raise prices by an average of 18 percent this year.\nReporting by Donny Kwok in Hong Kong; Additional reporting by Martinne Geller in London; Editing by Biju Dwarakanath and Jane Merriman\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-01-08T20:58:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-09T16:55:02.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
