The two are part of Hong Kong-based VTech Holdings Ltd.\nThe FTC alleged in a complaint filed by the Justice Department that the Kid Connect application sold with some of VTech’s electronic toys collected personal information of hundreds of thousands of children without parental consent. The firm also failed to take reasonable steps to secure the data it collected, the FTC said.\nReporting by Susan Heavey; Writing by David Alexander; Editing by Tim Ahmann\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-01-09T01:50:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-09T16:56:19.027+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
