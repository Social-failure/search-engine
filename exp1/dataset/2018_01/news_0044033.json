Investment, both domestic and foreign, has helped and the minister said it reached its highest levels in 18 years in 2017.\nWithout giving details, Cabral said he was talking to several companies at Davos about the prospects of investing in Portugal.\n“In Davos you have investors from all over the world, who are very curious and positive about Portugal at this moment,” he said.
