Comey has pointed to such comments as the real reason he was fired.\nComey’s firing forced Rosenstein to appoint Robert Mueller, another former FBI director, as special counsel overseeing the Russia investigation, which is ongoing. Mueller has since charged four people who worked for Trump’s campaign or in his White House for lying to the FBI and money laundering.\nClinton has said she partly blames Comey for her loss to Trump in the 2016 election.\nComey oversaw the investigation into the mishandling of classified government secrets by her and her staff on the email server kept in her New York home.\nIn July 2016, four months before the presidential election, Comey made a public announcement closing the investigation, in breach of usual FBI practices, a step he said was necessary to maintain public faith in the investigation’s integrity.\nHe said Clinton and her staff were “extremely careless” in handling classified information and that there was evidence they may have unknowingly broken laws, but recommended against prosecution.\nReporting by Jonathan Allen; Editing by Frank McGurty and Andrea Ricci\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-19T17:49:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-19T18:06:43.002+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
