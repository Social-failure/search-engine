We are very satisfied with the progress made so far”.\nSince taking over, Genish has sought to patch up relations with Rome, which considers some of the company’s assets strategic. The relations had become particularly strained when Vivendi became TIM’s biggest investor.\nIn the same statement, Genish said he was “100 percent committed to the re-launch of TIM and to the fine-tuning of the industrial plan to 2020, which represents a long-term personal and professional project”.\nTelecom Italia shares were flat by 0916 GMT at 0.74 euros.
