It did not enter Japanese territorial waters. \nA foreign submarine was also detected in the same area on Wednesday as well as on Thursday, it added, without identifying the nationality. Both had left the area by Thursday afternoon. \nJapan and China have long been at loggerheads over the tiny, uninhabited islands. They are controlled by Japan but claimed also by China. \n“We want to strongly urge China not to do anything to interfere with improving bilateral ties,” Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga told a news conference. \nKenji Kanasugi, director-general of the Japanese Foreign Ministry’s Asian and Oceanian Affairs Bureau, met with Chinese ambassador Cheng Yonghua at the Foreign Ministry to express grave concern about the move, the ministry said in a statement. \nThe Chinese ambassador responded to the protest by reiterating China’s stance on the islands, the statement added. \nChina routinely rejects Japanese criticism of such patrols, saying its ships have every right to operate in what China calls its territorial waters.
