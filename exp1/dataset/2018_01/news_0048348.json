The United Nations described Myanmar’s crackdown as ethnic cleansing, which Myanmar denies.\n“I pity her because she seems to be caught in the middle of being a Nobel Prize winner for peace and this is now the ruckus, she is heavily criticized,” Duterte said in his speech.\nHuman rights groups have also strongly criticized Duterte’s anti-narcotics campaign during which more than 3,900 suspected drug users and peddlers have been killed in what the police called self-defense after armed suspects resisted arrest.\nCritics dispute that and say executions are taking place with zero accountability, allegations the police reject.\nReporting by Aditya Kalra and Karen Lema; Editing by Sanjeev Miglani and Nick Macfie\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-26T11:26:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-26T11:45:28.005+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
