But a person close to the matter said last week that the two companies were currently not in talks about a potential combination. \nThe two companies are market leaders in Germany’s meal delivery business. \nDelivery Hero, which floated on the Frankfurt stock exchange in 2017 and whose competitors also include Deliveroo, UberEATS and Amazon, has grown into a global company thanks to a string of deals. \nMeal orders at Takeaway.com’s German unit Lieferando are estimated to have outstripped those of Delivery Hero’s top German brands Lieferheld and Pizza.de by 20 percent, Groen told the newspaper. \nDelivery Hero CEO Niklas Oestberg said in November the company “had more orders in Germany than our peers.” Reporting by Arno Schuetze; editing by Clelia Oziel", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-20T16:47:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-20T17:13:22.065+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
