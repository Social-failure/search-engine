(NYSE-MKT:IGC) provides compelling in vivo data compiled from genetically engineered mice to mimic Alzheimer’s shows marked improvement in spatial memory.\nScope of Studies\nTransgenic mice with a gene introduced to mimic Alzheimer’s were used to gauge the impact of IGC-AD1 on learning and memory function. A common model used to study learning and memory behavior in mice is the Morris Water Maze (MWM) test, which specifically evaluates spatial learning and memory. As with many of the results previously disclosed, Dr. Chuanhai Cao, IGC’s Senior Advisor and Associate Professor of Pharmaceutical Sciences at USF’s College of Pharmacy conducted the studies.\nAnalysis\nThe MWM study showed that mice treated with IGC-AD1 at various doses exhibited significantly decreased learning trial errors, and markedly decreased escape latency times as compared with the control groups. For example, normal mice with no Alzheimer’s markers took approximately 2 seconds to resolve the MWM, while mice with Alzheimer’s markers took approximately 8 seconds. Alzheimer’s disease model mice treated with the medication took approximately 4 seconds, an improvement of approximately 50% over the control group of untreated Alzheimer’s model mice. “This is exciting as it holds the potential for improvement in spatial memory and short-term memory among Alzheimer’s patients. “A common endpoint of Alzheimer’s is patients getting lost, or not being able to find their way home,” said Ram Mukunda, CEO of IGC.\n2018 Key Objectives\n“We are preparing the groundwork necessary to get Hyalolex, our lead product formulation for Alzheimer’s ready for Phase 2-B human trials. Independent of this, we expect to make the product available through medical dispensaries in select states of the U.S. In addition, we are working on addressing issues specific to the medical cannabis industry such as transactional difficulties, inadequate product labeling, product identification assurance (PIA) and product origin assurance (POA), using distributed ledgers inherent in blockchain technology. We are ready for an exciting 2018,” concluded Mr. Mukunda.\nAbout MWM\nMWM evaluates learning, memory and factors that influence visual acuity, motor function, and motivation. In the MWM task, the animal is required to discover a hidden platform to escape from swimming in a pool of water. To accomplish this task, the animal forms a “spatial orientation map” in the brain using visual stimuli from extra-maze cues in the testing room. During training, learning is assessed by the amount of time elapsed before the animal climbs onto the platform to escape the water (escape latency) and by the percentage of time or path length spent in the quadrant housing the platform (target quadrant) as well as a number of errors that occur in each trial. This is a test of cognitive function.\nAbout Alzheimer’s Disease\nAlzheimer’s Disease (AD) is a form of dementia. It is known as America’s most expensive disease, with an estimated cost to the U.S. economy of $236 billion. AD currently affects more than 5.3 million Americans and over 65% of AD patients are women. Over the next 20 years, the number of those afflicted with the disease is expected to double. The forecast is staggering, considering that to date, no effective cure has been found.\nAbout IGC\nIGC has two lines of business, a legacy infrastructure business and a cannabis pharmaceutical business that has developed a lead product for treating Alzheimer’s patients. The Company recently announced that it is working on using blockchain to address issues specific to the cannabis industry including transactional difficulties, product labeling, product identification assurance (PIA), and product origin assurance (POA). The Company is based in Maryland, USA.\nFor more information please visit www.igcinc.us and on www.igcpharma.com\nFollow us on Twitter @IGCIR and Facebook.com/IGCIR/\nForward-looking Statements\nPlease see forward looking statements as discussed in detail in IGC's Form 10K for fiscal year ended March 31, 2017, and in other reports filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.\nContact:\nClaudia Grimaldi\n301-983-0998\nSource:India Globalization Capital", "external_links": ["https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=km4AGd-m7vOGmfAFtTND0OvqfC4wm6iAJiDFXruQU10w43twji-GE_FsiUiHLKB-orkgWa6JZ6tOWBvyPfPESA==", "https://www.globenewswire.com/NewsRoom/AttachmentNg/2650acad-810c-469c-9867-d3fbc16492ea"], "published": "2018-01-02T16:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-02T16:30:48.032+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
