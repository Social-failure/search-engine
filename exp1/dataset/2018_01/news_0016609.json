They are talented players and I am sure their time will come again.” \nEngland squad - Joe Root (captain), Moeen Ali, James Anderson, Jonny Bairstow, Stuart Broad, Alastair Cook, Mason Crane, Ben Foakes, Liam Livingstone, Dawid Malan, Craig Overton, Ben Stokes, Mark Stoneman, James Vince, Chris Woakes, Mark Wood Reporting by Ed Osmond; Editing by Toby Davis", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-11T00:37:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-11T01:07:57.002+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
