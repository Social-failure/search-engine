Slideshow (5 Images) \nPliskova will meet top seed Simona Halep for a place in the semi-finals. \n“I think the first set was very close but I needed to step up and be more aggressive,” the tall 25-year-old said in the on-court interview. \n“I was playing fine the other two sets. On this surface I have a chance (against Halep).” Editing by Ed Osmond", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-22T18:03:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-22T18:25:56.010+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
