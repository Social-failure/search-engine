Cuban himself was sporting a glossy black wig with a headband. \nTweet \nInvestor Lori Greiner didn't have a wig to try on, but she did weigh in on the men's new looks on Twitter.\nTweet \nAs the pitch continued, the company's sales numbers paused the laughter.\nIn its first year, The Long Hairs business did $25,000 in sales. In its second year, Healy anticipates seeing $140,000 in sales, selling through the company's website and Amazon , he said. A pack of four hair ties sells for $12and only costs $1.60 to make. A headband costs $16.\n\"It is a fun little business, I give you guys credit,\" Cuban said.\nThose numbers attracted an offer from Kevin O'Leary, who added, \"You guys make crazy margins.\" O'Leary offered to invest $95,000 for a 10 percent stake in the business, with an additional $2 royalty payment per order until he makes $200,000.\nTweet \nCuban also made a bid, offering to give Barto and Healy $100,000 in exchange for 25 percent of the business. The pair negotiated him down to a 20 percent stake and they accepted Cuban's offer.\nTweet \n\"We struck a deal with the big dog,\" Barto said. \"We're in business with Mark Cuban.\"\nDon't miss: 'Shark Tank's' Lori Greiner says this laid-off inventor's product that prevents cooking spatter is her favorite this year \nLike this story?
