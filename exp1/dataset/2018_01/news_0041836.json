His turnaround effort is still likely to take a year or more to play out.\nGE’s fourth-quarter $11 billion charge includes $6.2 billion after tax for reevaluation of insurance assets, $3.4 billion for U.S. tax changes and $1.8 billion for impairments of energy financing at GE Capital.\nBurger on Wednesday reiterated that GE was unlikely to divest itself from its GECAS, the world’s second-largest aircraft lessor.\n“When you compare the stability of earnings, the consistency of earnings and return of capital, that’s definitely not lost on John Flannery, it’s not lost on the board,” Burger said.\nGECAS this year aims to increase its portfolio from a value of $43 billion to $44 billion or $45 billion, but it does not have immediate plans for large new aircraft orders, he said.\n“Over the last couple of years we have put in significant orders both for new (Boeing 737) MAXs and new (Airbus) NEOs. So I think this is a year when we are in what I would call consolidation mode,” he said.\nGECAS plans to deploy between $6 billion and $7 billion of capital this year and would consider acquiring aircraft portfolios from other lessors, he said.\nReporting by Conor Humphries, editing by Louise Heavens\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-01-24T19:28:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-25T13:25:26.003+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
