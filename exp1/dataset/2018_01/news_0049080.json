Zinc, used to galvanize steel, has rocketed 150 percent since early 2016. \nSTOCKS: Shortages of refined metal have seen stocks in LME-approved warehouses fall to their lowest since 2008 at 176,275 tonnes. MZNSTX-TOTAL \nHOLDINGS: Worries about a tight LME market have been reinforced by a large position holding between 80 and 89 percent of zinc warrants and cash contracts. <0#LME-WHL> \nBACKWARDATION: Demand for nearby metal pushed the premium for cash zinc over the three-month contract to $50.50 from $20.75 a week ago. MZN0-3 \nDEFICIT: Consultancy Wood Mackenzie expects a zinc market deficit of 350,000 tonnes this year and 150,000 tonnes in 2019. \nNICKEL: Nickel finished up 1.1 percent at $13,805 after touching $14,040 a tonne, the highest since May 2015. The stainless steel ingredient has been boosted by expectations of surging demand for use in batteries to power electric vehicles. \nTECHNICALS: Nickel last week burst above a long-term downtrend from 2011, triggering technical buying. Fibonacci resistance comes in at $14,590, said brokers Marex Spectron. \nOUTPUT: 2017 nickel production by Canadian miner First Quantum Minerals fell 24 percent year-on-year to 17,837 tonnes, contributing to a global market deficit. \nTIN: LME tin ended 1.5 percent higher at $21,925 after reaching $22,000 a tonne, the highest since November 2016. The metal used for soldering has risen 17 percent since mid-December. \nSTOCKS: Tin stocks are near record lows and one entity holds between 50 and 79 percent of warrants and cash contracts, fanning fears over availability. MSNSTX-TOTAL <0#LME-WHL> \nCHINA: A senior official said economic growth in China, the world’s biggest metals consumer, will likely slow to 6.5-6.8 percent this year. \nCOPPER STRIKE: Chile’s Codelco has struck a contract deal with workers at its Andina copper mine as it tries to reach advance agreements with unions in a year busy with labour negotiations. \nOTHER METALS: Copper ended unchanged at $7,085 a tonne, aluminium ended down 1.4 percent at $2,225.50 a tonne and lead closed 0.4 percent higher at $2,602 a tonne.
