He had been brought to put Altice's ailing French mobile operator SFR back on track. ( reut.rs/2lTOirC ) \nThe appointment comes a month after Sprint struck a deal with Altice's U.S. business that will allow the U.S. telecom provider to use Altice's cable infrastructure to transmit cellular data and develop a 5G network. ( reut.rs/2CsAkUR ) \n“(Combes) has strong Street credibility and comes to Sprint as the company is looking to turn the ship around in a choppy environment,” GBH Insights analyst Daniel Ives said. \nHe will also be appointed to Sprint’s board at a later date and will be responsible for leading the company’s financial operations, strategy and continued cost transformation, the wireless carrier said. \nSprint and T-Mobile recently called off their merger talks to create a stronger U.S. wireless company to rival market leaders, leaving Sprint to engineer a turnaround on its own.
