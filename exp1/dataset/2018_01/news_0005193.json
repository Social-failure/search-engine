On Thursday, the grid had a reserve of over 2,100 MW. One megawatt is enough to power about 1,000 U.S. homes. \nBlomberg said, however, that the loss of Pilgrim “does further challenge the region on fuel availability because we need to rely on other generating resources to meet consumer demand and meet overall grid reliability.” \nThe region, which usually gets about half of its power from gas-fired generators, was already receiving more electricity from oil-fired units instead of gas. \nBlomberg said Pilgrim shut Thursday afternoon “due to storm conditions.” \nEntergy spokesman Patrick O‘Brien said the company was ”working to determine the cause of the line loss, noting the plant had been operating safely for 227 days following the completion of its most recent refueling outage in May 2017. \n“We will take this opportunity to conduct preventive maintenance that we could not otherwise perform with the plant operating at full power,” O‘Brien said.
