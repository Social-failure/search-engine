Changes may be unveiled as soon as the Feb. 19 budget, analysts say.\nBut in an Institute of Policy Studies survey 40 percent of 2,000 respondents said they would not be comfortable paying for higher social spending on the elderly through higher taxation instead of tapping on the national reserves.\nOf the remaining, 34 percent said they would be comfortable and 26 percent said they remained neutral.\nThe telephone survey of Singaporean citizens and permanent residents aged 21 years and above was conducted between November and December.\nReporting by John Geddie; Editing by Neil Fullick\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-01-18T15:33:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-19T12:32:34.001+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
