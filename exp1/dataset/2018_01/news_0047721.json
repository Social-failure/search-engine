She goes, 'Dad, I love it,'\" the former New York Yankee said in an interview with CNBC's \" Closing Bell \" on Friday.\nRob Tringali | SportsChrome | Getty Images Alex Rodriguez #13 of the New York Yankees enters the field with daughters Natasha and Ella during the pre-game ceremony honoring Alex's 3000th hit before the game against the Toronto Blue Jays at Yankee Stadium on September 13, 2015 in the Bronx borough of New York City. Rodriguez, one of the highest-paid athletes of all time, is no stranger to investing. It started in 2003 when he bought a duplex. That investment has grown into a diversified holding company, A-Rod Corp, which focuses on real estate, sports and wellness, media and entertainment.\n\"We usually like to invest in companies that we understand, that we're passionate about and we can bring our expertise, which is more than capital. We don't want to be just capital,\" Rodriguez said.\nHis firm's latest investment is in Petros Pace Finance, which specializes in financing commercial properties that want to reduce their carbon footprint.\nAs far as stocks, he said he likes to keep it simple and focus on things the family is using every day. That means names such as Google , Amazon and Facebook. He said he also likes Berkshire Hathaway, J.P. Morgan Chase and Bank of America.\nRodriguez reportedly made more than $325 million playing baseball. He retired in 2016.\nDisclaimer\nWATCH: Former MLB all-star A-Rod breaks down a new $10 million investment show chapters Former MLB all-star A-Rod breaks down a new $10 million investment 22 Hours Ago | 04:23", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-27T01:52:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-27T01:54:12.003+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
