The building is part of an investment plan that includes $15 billion of new lending and nearly $5 billion in spending and is due in part to the reduction in U.S. corporate taxes and a more favourable regulatory environment.\nWhile the New York-based bank did not say which markets it intends to enter, it noted that it does not have branches in Boston, Philadelphia or Washington, D.C.\nJPMorgan has found that people who want to open new accounts look to see which banks have convenient branches even though they will do most of their transactions electronically.\nDuckett said branches are critical to establishing the bank’s presence locally and serve as hubs for mortgage lending, asset management and services to small businesses, such as accepting daily cash deposits.\nAcross its established markets where it has 5,130 branches in 23 states, the number of locations is slowly decreasing as the bank consolidates and uses more ATMs, Duckett said.\nChief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon said for years that he would like to try to expand into more cities. But Dimon held back because of the need to build capital for higher regulatory requirements and fund upgrades in information technology.\nThe federal tax cuts are expected to save JPMorgan, the largest U.S. bank by assets, more than $4 billion annually, analysts estimate.\nDuckett said the new branch building will be different from that before electronic transactions were popular. Chase will start with higher mix of ATM kiosks in the markets than it has now. And, the bank will also open scaled-down “Everyday Express” offices of ATMs and as few as two employees.\nIn 2013, to add to its Florida franchise and gain experience entering new cities, JPMorgan opened three branches in Jacksonville. Now it has 20 branches there.\nReporting by David Henry in New York; Editing by Lisa Shumaker\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-24T00:24:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-24T00:42:38.004+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
