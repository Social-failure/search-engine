That is only stored in users' mobiles, computers and other terminals,\" WeChat said in a post on the social media platform. \n\"WeChat will not use any content from user chats for big data analysis. Because of WeChat's technical model that does not store or analyse user chats, the rumor that 'we are watching your WeChat everyday' is pure misunderstanding.\" \nLi Shufu, chairman of Geely Holdings , owner of the Volvo car brand, was quoted in Chinese media on Monday as saying Tencent Chairman Ma Huateng \"must be watching all our WeChats every day\". \nLike all Chinese social media platforms, WeChat is required to censor public posts deemed \"illegal\" by the Communist Party. WeChat's privacy policy says it may need to retain and disclose users' information \"in response to a request by a government authority, law enforcement agency or similar body\". \nWeChat did not immediately respond to a request for further comment. \nAccording to a report by Amnesty International, Tencent ranked at the bottom of 11 tech firms running the world's most popular messenger apps for how they use encryption to protect user privacy. \nChina's cyber watchdog in September announced a new rule making chat group administrators and companies accountable for breaches of content rules. \nIn the same month it handed down maximum penalties to tech firms including Tencent, Baidu and Weibo Corp for failing to properly censor online content, and asked them to increase content auditing measures.
