REUTERS/Hannah McKay \nIn November, Brokenshire was forced to begin setting a budget for the province, but he said a return to direct rule could still be avoided. \nTalks between Irish nationalists Sinn Fein and the pro-British Democratic Unionist Party had been expected to resume in the coming weeks. \nBrokenshire was criticised for continually resetting deadlines in talks to restore the region’s power-sharing government. \nDespite studious efforts by Brokenshire to be seen as an honest broker, some of the parties said a deal by the DUP last year to prop up May’s government made this impossible. \nA reversion to direct rule could further strain relations with Ireland, which have deteriorated drastically in the past 12 months. \nLast year, Bradley overruled the advice of regulator Ofcom and pushed for the firmest possible scrutiny of the proposed Sky deal. Her as-yet unnamed successor will have to handle the preliminary findings of a review by the competition regulator, expected this month.
