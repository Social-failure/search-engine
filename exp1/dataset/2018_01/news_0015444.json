The Baltic Exchange is looking to support the LNG freight market as it matures and we hope to deliver greater transparency through an index.” \nThe exchange publishes the Baltic Dry Index, which is the most widely known freight benchmark, that tracks rates for ships transporting dry bulk commodities including iron ore and coal.
