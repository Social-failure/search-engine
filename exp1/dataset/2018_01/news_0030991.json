He said the miner’s wife was also shot in the attack and was recovering.\nLonmin spokeswoman Wendy Tlou said the company’s head of security “has confirmed a murder and attempted murder. We are still awaiting official information from the police and don’t know the motive at this stage”.\nSeveral AMCU members were shot dead on the platinum belt last year, while NUM members have also been attacked. The houses and cars of NUM members at Harmony Gold’s Kusasalthu mine were torched in the gold sector late last year.\nDozens of South African miners have been killed in violence stemming from labor unrest in recent years, including 34 who were shot dead by police in August 2012 during a wildcat strike at Lonmin’s Marikana mine.\nReporting by Ed Stoddard; Editing by Paul Tait\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-01-19T14:58:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-19T14:18:06.003+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
