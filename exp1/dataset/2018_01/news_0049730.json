CVC acquired an 80 percent stake in the betting business from pay-television operator Sky ( SKYB.L ) just over three years ago in a deal that at the time valued it at 800 million pounds.\nSky, which itself is in the target of a 11.7 billion-pound takeover by Twenty-First Century Fox Inc ( FOXA.O ), still owns 20 percent of Sky Bet.\nThe British government is considering cutting the maximum stake that customers can place on fixed-odds betting terminals (FOBTs), machines that critics say fuel problem gambling.\nThe measures, which could see FOBT stakes cut to 2 pounds from 100 pounds, are expected to trigger a wave of deal-making among betting firms as they seek to offset the impact of the crackdown and shift away from high street shops.\nIn December, Ladbrokes Coral ( LCL.L ), Britain’s largest betting shop operator with more than 3,500 sites, agreed to be bought by online gambling company GVC ( GVC.L ) in a deal that gives the bookmaker a valuation of at least 3.2 billion pounds.\nThe deal has exemplified how the growing popularity of internet gambling has quickly transformed the industry, as more gamblers move online. While the Ladbrokes brand dates back more than 130 years, its new owner GVC was only founded in 2004.\n($1 = 0.7101 pounds)\nReporting by Dasha Afanasieva and Ben Martin; editing by Alexander Smith\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-01-30T00:36:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-30T03:16:05.023+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
