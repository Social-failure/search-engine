It burned for much of the day after an initial blast at 8:45 a.m. on Monday because part of the blowout preventer appears to have failed, which allowed gas to continue feeding the fire, local officials said. \nBy Lynn Cook Russell Gold \nFive people are presumed dead following a well explosion in Oklahoma, authorities said Tuesday, in what appears to be the deadliest shale drilling accident since the boom in U.S. oil and gas production began a decade ago. \nThe men were working Monday morning on a new natural gas well near Quinton, 150 miles east of Oklahoma City, when it blew out, causing an intense fire that toppled the drilling rig’s derrick. \nSeventeen other employees escaped the site, one with minor injuries, but the missing men had not been recovered as of Tuesday, leading authorities to assume the worst. \n“We have moved from rescue to recovery,” said Chris Moore, sheriff of Pittsburg County, Okla. “We are waiting for the scene to be cooled down and stabilized for the investigation to continue.” \nRead: Oil prices rise as traders bet that U.S. supplies fell a 10th week in a row \nThe well was being drilled by Patterson-UTI Drilling Co.
