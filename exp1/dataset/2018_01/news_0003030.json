This year, the firm projects Google will make $40.08 billion in U.S. digital ad revenue, while Facebook is poised to bring in $21.57 billion. \nThough YouTube is still the preferred digital video platform to advertise on, Facebook is encroaching on its top position. In particular, 41 percent of the survey takers considered Facebook video the best place to launch a new ad campaign over TV (25 percent) and YouTube (10 percent). While the digital ad market is expected to have a compound annual growth rate of 13 percent between 2018 and 2023, Google is only expected to increase 11 percent.\nThere was also increasing interest in advertising on Snapchat -like service Instagram Stories, with ad buyers saying they preferred Instagram Stories over Snapchat.\nBoth Facebook and Google shares are expected to outperform, with Facebook's price target at $220 while Alphabet's at $1,230.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-04T19:52:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-04T19:54:27.022+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
