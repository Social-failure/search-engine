Thank you, thank you, thank you,” she squeaked from the red and white polka dot stage. Slideshow (5 Images) \nPop star Katy Perry, also dressed in red and white polka dots for the occasion, said she had been a fan of Minnie since the age of two or three. \n“Minnie and Mickey printed diapers - that was my first memory ever and it turned into a lifelong devotion,” the “Firework” singer said. \n“No one rocks a bow, or the colour red, quite like her,” Perry added. \nWalk of Fame honorees are selected by the Hollywood Chamber of Commerce. \nWomen have stepped up their campaign in recent years for equal pay in Hollywood and better representation behind and in front of the camera. \nIt took Minnie much longer than her boyfriend to receive Monday’s accolade because Disney only nominated her last year, Walk of Fame producer Ana Martinez told the Thomson Reuters Foundation. \n“Maybe he was more popular back in the day,” Martinez said. \nDonald Duck, Tinker Bell, Snow White and other Disney characters were immortalized on the Walk of Fame before Minnie.
