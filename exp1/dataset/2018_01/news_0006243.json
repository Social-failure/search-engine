We have always opted for peace and dialogue”. \nEsquerra lawmakers have said Puigdemont has the right to again be Catalan president, but if he is unable to return from Brussels he should step aside for Junqueras. \nEsquerra and Junts per Catalunya, along with a smaller separatist party, have not yet agreed on a coalition. \nRajoy fired both Junqueras and Puigdemont when he imposed direct control over Catalonia after its separatist-controlled government declared independence following an Oct. 1 referendum on secession from Spain, which courts ruled illegal. \nJunqueras’s defense, and other separatist leaders, contend that the independence drive was legal and they have criticized the Spanish government and judiciary for what they call a heavy-handed response. \nAt a court hearing on Thursday, Junqueras said he was a man of peace and dialogue. \nHowever, judges said on Friday they did not believe that his offer of dialogue indicated he would abandon the “conflict with the state.” Reporting by Jesús Aguado and Inmaculada Sanz; Editing by Angus Berwick and Adrian Croft", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-05T14:21:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-05T14:28:56.007+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
