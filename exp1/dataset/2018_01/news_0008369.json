REUTERS/Rick Wilking \nNevertheless, Nvidia said development of the Uber self-driving programme had gained steam, with one million autonomous miles being driven in just the past 100 days. \nWith Volkswagen, Nvidia said it was infusing its artificial intelligence technology into the German automakers’ future lineup, using Nvidia’s new Drive IX platform. The technology will enable so-called “intelligent co-pilot” capabilities based on processing sensor data inside and outside the car.

The system on a chip delivers 30 trillion operations per second using 30 watts of power. \nBets that Nvidia will become a leader in chips for driverless cars, data centres and artificial intelligence have more than doubled its stock price in the past 12 months, making the Silicon Valley company the third-strongest performer in the S&P 500 during that time.
