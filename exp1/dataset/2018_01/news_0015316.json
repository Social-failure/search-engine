The benchmark lost 0.6 percent in the previous session.\nMajor indexes on Wall Street finished in the red on Wednesday as investors grew anxious after Bloomberg reported that China, the world’s biggest foreign holder of U.S. Treasuries, could slow or halt U.S. government bond purchases.\n“If China was to reduce their involvement in buying U.S. government debt, it would have a significant impact on interest rates, which is why I think we’re seeing our banks lead the market lower today,” said Christopher Conway, head of research and trading at Australian Stock Report.\n“The pullback we saw yesterday and the pullback we are seeing today is relatively healthy considering the run-up we had seen in the market prior to this minor sell-off.”\nFinancials bore the brunt of the downturn. Australia and New Zealand Banking Group declined 0.9 percent to its lowest in a week, while Westpac Banking Corp and Commonwealth Bank of Australia fell about 0.7 percent each.\nHealthcare giant CSL Ltd was among the biggest drags on the index, suffering its largest drop in over five weeks.\nMaterial stocks, which opened higher on the back of solid oil and metal prices, snapped back into the red with the rest of the market. Heavyweight BHP Billiton Ltd fell 0.8 percent, the worst loss in over three weeks.\nNew Zealand’s benchmark S&P/NZX 50 index dropped 1.4 percent to an over a four-week low at 8,248.23, with losses seen across most sectors.\nDairy firm A2 Milk Company slumped 4.2 percent to a near four-week low, while Ryman Healthcare Ltd posted its biggest intraday drop in over 11 weeks.
