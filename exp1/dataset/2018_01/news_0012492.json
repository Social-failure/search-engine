Punk icon Vivienne Westwood announced last month that she would eschew a runway show and showcase her collection via an audio-visual presentation. \nOther big Brands, including Britain’s Burberry and J.W. Anderson, decided to skip the event last year and this year respectively, in favor of holding ‘co-ed’ shows during London’s fashion week for womenswear in February. \n“All we’re trying to do is shorten the distance from a consumer to a pair of trousers,” said London Fashion Week Men’s Chairman Dylan Jones, who is also the editor of British GQ magazine. \n“If a brand or a designer deems that it’s much better for them to do a joint show, a show out of season, a digital show, go direct to consumer – doesn’t matter. It’s all about amplifying British creativity and selling.” FILE PHOTO: Models present creations at the Burberry catwalk show during London Fashion Week in London, Britain February 20, 2017.

And that’s the great thing about fashion – it keeps changing.” Reporting by Mark Hanrahan and Pedro Caiado; Writing by Mark Hanrahan; editing by Ralph Boulton", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-05T17:39:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-05T17:55:20.038+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
