The Dow rose 0.42 percent, while the S&P 500 gained 0.83 percent and the Nasdaq 1.5 percent.\nThe gains in riskier assets came as industry surveys from India to Germany to Canada showed quickening activity.\n“The breadth of the recovery is extraordinary,” said Deutsche Bank macro strategist Alan Ruskin, noting that of 31 countries covered, only three failed to show growth while all the largest manufacturing sectors improved.\nElsewhere, spot gold reached its highest since mid-September at $1,321.33, before edging back to $1,313.81 per ounce.\nOil prices hit their highest since mid-2015, only to stall when major pipelines in Libya and the UK restarted and U.S production soared to the strongest in more than four decades.\nBrent crude futures was trading flat at $66.57 a barrel, while U.S. crude futures CLc1 nudged up 7 cents to $60.43 a barrel.
