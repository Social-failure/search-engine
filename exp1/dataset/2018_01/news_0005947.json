Toyota now has 10 manufacturing operations in the United States. \nToyoda stepped down as company president in 1995. Toyota said in a short statement that Toyoda died of pneumonia on Dec. 30. He is survived by his wife, Ayako Toyoda. \nReporting By Joe White; Editing by Bill Rigby\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-06T19:17:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-06T19:37:19.002+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
