We think this a great model.” Reporting by Bill Berkrot in New York; Editing by Matthew Lewis and Jonathan Oatis", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-01-08T20:05:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-08T14:06:04.045+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
