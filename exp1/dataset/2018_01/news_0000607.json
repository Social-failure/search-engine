The stock was set for its worst ever daily fall after the UK department store said price cuts failed to lure shoppers in. \nDisappointment at the retailer’s performance dented other UK retailers which had rallied strongly on Wednesday after Next’s Christmas trading beat. \nOverall analysts were becoming marginally less negative on euro zone company earnings as the Q4 results season began.
