Gribbin. \nTrump, who spoke frequently about improving infrastructure in the United States during his 2016 election campaign, earlier on Tuesday in a separate meeting on immigration policy stated his desire to see an infrastructure package passed quickly. \n“The Trump Administration looks forward to working with all members of Congress who want to join us in rebuilding America,” a White House official said. \nFor more on Trump’s past statements on U.S. infrastructure spending, watch Fortune’s video: \nRepublican Senator John Barrasso of Wyoming, who chairs the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee that would oversee an infrastructure bill, said the meeting was an opportunity for the administration to explain its priorities. \n“The meeting gave senators the chance to have a direct back-and-forth with administration leadership on their priorities,” Barrasso said in a statement. \nSenator Tom Carper of Delaware, the top Democrat on the committee, praised the meeting as an opportunity to work with the administration. \n“While there is no shortage of issues on which the president and I disagree, the kind of large scale trillion dollar infrastructure investment that then-candidate Trump talked about is something that has the potential to elicit bipartisan support here in Congress,” Carper said in a statement.
