REUTERS/Phil Noble \nPeugeot-maker PSA bought General Motors’ loss-making European arm, which operates as Opel on the continent and Vauxhall in Britain, last year and has been pursuing a restructuring plan to return it to profitability. \nThe French group said in October it would cut 400 jobs at its Ellesmere Port site and on Monday announced a further 250 losses, reducing the workforce by a third to make it more efficient, renewing workers’ fears about the future. \nThe source familiar with the matter said Clark and Tavares would discuss a number of issues and Wednesday’s face-to-face had been planned for some time. \n“The meeting has been in the diary for a while,” the source said. \nA PSA spokesman confirmed that the meeting was taking place. \n“Business as usual. Carlos Tavares meets quiet often members of government where the Group operates,” he said by email.

REUTERS/Phil Noble \nThe firm is due to decide as soon as this year whether to build new cars at the site, in the latest test of Britain’s ability to attract investment as it leaves the European Union. \nThe head of Britain’s biggest trade union Len McCluskey is also due to meet Tavares this month and warned that any plans to close the firm’s Vauxhall car plant in northern England will cost it sales in Opel-Vauxhall’s largest market.
