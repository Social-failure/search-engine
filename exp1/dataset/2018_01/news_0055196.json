He pointed to increased competition among companies due to globalisation and digitisation which made it difficult to pass on rising production costs to clients through higher prices. \nThe German government expects national consumer price inflation (CPI) to slow to 1.7 percent this year from 1.8 percent in 2017, despite having lifted its 2018 growth forecast to 2.4 percent from 1.9 percent previously, a government document showed on Tuesday. \nThe euro zone will publish preliminary inflation data on Wednesday, with the annual rate expected to edge down to 1.3 percent in January from 1.4 percent in December according to Reuters polls. \nThe ECB confirmed last week that it will continue buying bonds at least until September and for as long as inflation is not on a sustained path towards it target. It also pledged to keep rates at their current, ultra-low levels for long after those purchases stop. \nInflation in the euro zone is comfortably above one percent but it is not expected to hit the ECB’s target for years to come. \n“The ECB can take it easy because inflation won’t be galloping,” VP Bank economist Thomas Gitzel said. \n“Provided that there won’t be major fluctuations in oil prices, this picture won’t change. So for now, Mario Draghi can stick to his chosen course,” Gitzel added. \nHawks among the ECB rate-setters, including the German representative on the central bank’s policymaking body, Bundesbank head Jens Weidmann, have argued that it would be “appropriate” for the ECB to stop its bond purchases before the end of this year. \nWeidmann and other rate-setters have been blaming the ECB’s 2.55 trillion-euro ($3.17 trillion) bond-buying programme for fuelling bubbles in the property and bond markets.
