The government has no official figure.\nA few countries, including Nepal, India, New Zealand, Australia and Canada, have already offered third gender options.\nTheir citizens can choose between male or female, or they may select an indeterminate gender, which is usually marked by an ‘x’ or ‘o’ in the passport.\nReporting by Beh Lih Yi @behlihyi, Editing by Jared Ferrie; Please credit the Thomson Reuters Foundation, the charitable arm of Thomson Reuters, that covers humanitarian news, women's rights, trafficking, property rights, climate change and resilience.
