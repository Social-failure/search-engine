The new regional distribution centre forms part of Lidl’s plan to invest 1.45 billion pounds ($1.96 billion) in Britain in 2017-18. \nLidl UK, which currently trades from 690 stores, said it will open five new London stores in the next two months and has plans for a further five warehouses. \nLidl UK is scheduled to update on Christmas trading on Wednesday. \nLast week German rival Aldi UK [ALDIEI.UL] reported an over 15 percent rise in total sales for December and said it would press ahead with its aggressive expansion in 2018.
