They're brighter and more colorful than traditional LCD panels, and Samsung is currently the sole provider.\nLG Display doesn't have the same capacity as Samsung, however. The Korea Herald said Samsung can pump out 10 million screens a month while LG is aiming to hit around 6 million.\nEarlier reports from KGI suggested that Apple is gearing up to launch three new iPhones in 2018, with 6.5-inch, 5.8-inch and 6.1-inch screens.
