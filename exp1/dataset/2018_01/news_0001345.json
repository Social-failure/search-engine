The knockout tournament provides a winner take-all purse of $250,000. \n“It really will be an intriguing contest,” Australian Open Tournament Director Craig Tiley said. \n”These guys are all coming in at different stages of their preparation, but once their competitive instincts kick in, which will be almost instant in this format, there will be some absorbing contests. \n“Remember, there is not much room for error. You lose the tie break and you are out.” Reporting by Greg Stutchbury in Wellington; Editing by Rory Carroll", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-01-01T08:33:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-01T03:56:08.005+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
