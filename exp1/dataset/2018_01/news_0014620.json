While it has promised to reduce carbon intensity over 2016-2020, total emissions are still expected to rise over the period.\nChina last month launched its long-awaited nationwide emissions trading system, which will cover the power sector in the first phase, and is aimed at reducing carbon emissions.\nReporting by David Stanway; Editing by Michael Perry\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-09T03:27:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-09T10:24:52.006+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
