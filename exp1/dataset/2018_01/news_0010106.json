WTI the day before hit its strongest since late 2014 at $64.77 a barrel.\nBrent crude futures were at $69.27 a barrel, virtually unchanged from their last close. Brent also marked a December-2014 high the previous day, at $70.05 a barrel.\n\"OPEC has acted successfully to reduce the inventory overhang and demand growth remains robust in the short term,\" said Sanjeev Bahl, analyst at Edison Investment Research in a 2018 outlook.\nThe production cuts started in January last year and are set to last through 2018.\n\"There is potential for oil prices to move higher as inventories normalise,\" Bahl said.\nU.S. commercial crude oil inventories <C-STK-T-EIA> fell almost 5 million barrels in the week to Jan. 5, to 419.5 million barrels.\nThat's slightly below the five-year average of just over 420 million barrels.\nFuel price hedging company Global Risk Management said in its 2018 outlook that \"the likelihood of elevated oil prices this year seems imminent\", largely due to the ongoing supply cuts led by OPEC and Russia as well as political risk especially in Iran, Venezuela and Libya.\nGlobal Risk Management said this was despite U.S. oil production <C-OUT-T-EIA>, currently at 9.5 million barrels per day (bpd), likely breaking through 10 million bpd.\nAnother factor that may hamper crude prices would be a drop-off in orders from refineries.\nIn Asia, Singapore average refinery profit margins <DUB-SIN-REF> have fallen below $6 per barrel this month, their lowest seasonal level in five years.\nAs a result, some refiners have already scaled back their output, reducing demand for feedstock crude.\nChina's crude oil imports in December eased to 33.7 million tonnes (7.97 million bpd), versus 37.04 million tonnes in November, customs data showed on Friday.\nMeanwhile, its December oil products exports hit a record 6.17 million tonnes, as refiners churn out more fuel than even thirsty China can absorb.\nTaking into account price supportive and pressuring factors, a market survey of over 1,000 energy professionals conducted by Reuters in January showed crude oil price expectations clustered in a range of $60-$70 per barrel for 2018.\n(Reporting by Henning Gloystein; Editing by Joseph Radford)", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-12T07:38:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-14T00:10:35.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
