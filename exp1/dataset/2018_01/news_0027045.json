Qatar Airways is one of the largest Middle East airlines and is a major customer of Airbus and its rival, Boeing ( BA.N ). \n(This version of the story restores the dropped word “be” in paragraph eight) Additional reporting by Tim Hepher in Paris; Writing by Saeed Azhar; Editing by Jane Merriman and Keith Weir", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-17T15:06:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-17T15:49:13.017+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
