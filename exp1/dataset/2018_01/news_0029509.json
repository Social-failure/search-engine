Rocket owns a 43 percent stake in Home24, while other investors include Swedenâ€™s Kinnevik and Baille Gifford.\n$1 = 0.8167 euros Reporting by Emma Thomasson; Editing by Maria Sheahan\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-01-18T19:52:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-19T12:19:43.008+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
