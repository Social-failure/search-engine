REUTERS/Alkis Konstantinidis \nRegistrations declined to 1.03 million passenger cars from 1.09 million a year earlier, the consulting firm said on Friday. Its numbers are based on a combination of published national data and estimates for some smaller markets that have yet to report. \nThe seasonally adjusted annualised rate (SAAR) of Western European sales slipped 1.9 percent from November levels to 14.29 million cars, according to LMC. \nSales slumped 14.4 percent in Britain and were down 3.2 percent in Italy, 1 percent in Germany and 0.5 percent in France while Spain posted a 6.2 percent gain, LMC said. \n“The selling-day effect meant most markets in the region were down year-on-year, though Spain was notable in bucking this trend,” LMC analyst Jonathon Poskitt said.
