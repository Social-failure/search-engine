Earlier this month, workers staged short walkouts at carmakers Ford and Daimler and washing machine manufacturer Miele.\nAcross Germany, more than 250 companies are to be affected, IG Metall has said.\nThe union has also asked for workers to be given the right to reduce their weekly hours to 28 from 35 to care for children, elderly or sick relatives, and return to full time after two years.\nEmployers have offered a 6.8 percent increase but have rejected the demand for shorter hours unless they can also increase workers’ hours when necessary.
