Extra carrying capacity typically allows airlines to carry more payload or fly further. \nPlueger said Airbus appeared for the time being to favour increasing the maximum takeoff weight of the A321neo over more radical developments such as investing in a new carbon wing. \nNeither Boeing nor Airbus could be immediately reached for comment.
