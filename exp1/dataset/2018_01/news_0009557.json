Boatwright was the game’s leading rebounder with 11.\nStanford was down by 11 at halftime and 68-53 near the midpoint of second half before rallying.\nOscar da Silva’s 3-pointer with 6:21 to play capped a 12-0 spurt that got the Cardinal within 68-65.\nThe Cardinal were still down four with under three minutes to go before baskets by Travis and Okpala tied the score and set the stage for Davis’ go-ahead layup with 1:43 left.\nStanford scored the game’s first seven points, but USC responded with seven 3-pointers in the final 15 minutes of the first half, propelling the Trojans into a 47-36 lead.\nMcLaughlin had a pair of 3’s in an early 11-0 burst that erased Stanford’s lead. He and Boatwright each had one late in the half, when the Trojans pulled away into their double-digit lead.\nMcLaughlin had 14 of his 16 points in the half.\n--Field Level Media\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-01-08T13:48:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-09T16:56:03.063+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
