That duo went on to dominate the year.\nWith so much uncertainty about so many contenders, this year’s men’s event is one of the hardest to predict for years, although three-times former champion Mats Wilander believes returning from an injury can make players especially dangerous.\n“It can free up the mind because you’re coming in with lower expectations maybe,” the Swede, who will be hosting his Game, Set and Mats show for Eurosport during the Open, told Reuters.\nFederer displayed that freedom last year and Wilander believes that fellow Swiss Wawrinka, who ended last season in August with a knee complaint, could arrive with a similar attitude this time around at Melbourne Park.\n”Wawrinka is the perfect player for a major,“ Wilander said. ”He has won three, won the Aussie Open.\n“Stan can be up and down in the season but delivers at the majors. If he comes back with the joy of fighting and the joy of playing and his confidence is high, he is as dangerous as all the other guys.”\nWith so many injuries, questions have been raised about the demands of the men’s game, but Wilander does not subscribe to the theory that it is anything sinister.\n”What it shows is that the top guys are staying at the top longer, for whatever reason that is,“ he said. ”Now going past 30 is not that important because they look after themselves.\n”But they have more miles on the clock and that results in injuries. With Novak the elbow, Rafa the knee, Federer the knee and now Murray the hip, it’s just wear and tear eventually.\n”The other thing is that the younger guys have not taken their places. That means we focus more on the old guys.\n“If Federer was 15 in the world and Rafa 20 and (Alexander) Zverev and (Nick) Kyrgios were one and two and winning majors we wouldn’t even be talking about the older guys.”\nWilander also said that even though they are older and more creaky, Federer and Nadal still possess an aura that means they win matches before leaving the locker room.\n“Even when less than 100 percent they are still intimidating,” he said.\nReporting by Martyn Herman, editing by Pritha Sarkar\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-08T06:17:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-08T06:34:58.019+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
