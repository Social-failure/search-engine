The output gap shows demand exceeds supply by the most in more than nine years. Stock prices are at their highest in 26 years, and corporate profits are near an all-time high.\nBusiness investment is rising, exports are growing and the labor market is the tightest in decades, due partly to a shrinking population.\nReporting by Stanley White; Editing by Shri Navaratnam\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-01-24T08:44:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-24T15:23:24.008+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
