Five other players chipped in six to nine points apiece.\nMarcus Lee led all scorers with 23 and all rebounders with 12 for the Golden Bears (7-15, 1-8), but it wasn’t enough to keep them from falling further into the conference basement. Justice Sueing hit for 14 points and Darius McNeill added 13.\nUSC led just 31-29 at the half, but put its stamp on the second half pretty quickly. Stewart drained a 3-pointer at the 16:19 mark to cap an 8-2 spurt that made it a 39-31 game. Chimezie Metu dunked with 13:56 left to give the Trojans their first double-figure lead at 44-34.\nCal made one more push, edging within 46-41 with 11:53 remaining on a rare five-point possession. Lee converted a 3-point play and McNeill hit two foul shots after Metu was whistled for a technical, his fourth personal foul.\nBut USC ran off and hid at that point. Mathews canned a 3 just over two minutes later to restore a 10-point advantage and Jordan McLaughlin, who dished out 10 assists, added a 3-ball on the next trip to make it 60-47. The margin reached 22 points in garbage time.\nThe Golden Bears got off to a quick start for the second time on their Los Angeles road swing. They led UCLA 27-14 in the first half Thursday night before fading, and established a 16-8 edge at the second media timeout in this one.\nHowever, the Trojans reeled them in over the half’s remainder and left for the locker room with a two-point edge after Mathews converted a 3-pointer with 12 seconds remaining.\nCal was held to 38.6 percent shooting from the field and committed 20 turnovers, 14 in the first half.\n--Field Level Media\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-01-29T07:27:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-29T21:59:30.015+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
