The Wall Street Journal first reported the news Sunday evening.\nThe offer represents a premium of 63 percent to Bioverativ's Friday closing price and would be all cash.\nBioverativ is a spin-out of biotech giant Biogen , and drew $274.8 million in third-quarter revenue from its two products for hemophilia. That was up 27 percent from the prior year's quarter, though the franchise faces increasing competition from Roche , and, further down the line, from one-time gene therapy approaches being pursued by BioMarin , Spark Therapeutics and others.\nSanofi, based in Paris, had been at the table of two of the largest biotech deals in recent years, but had come up empty-handed: Johnson & Johnson's purchase of Actelion for $30 billion in January 2017, and Pfizer's acquisition of Medivation for $14 billion in August 2016.\nRepresentatives from Sanofi and BioVerativ didn't immediately respond to requests for comment on Sunday night.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-22T05:24:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-22T05:25:43.015+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
