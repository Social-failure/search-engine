It closed at 2798 on Thursday.\nInvestors still fretted about bond yields and inflation.\nThe most frequently asked question by institutions was “what level of bond yields will cause an equity correction”, while private clients were most concerned about how to position for inflation.\nWhile bonds also drew strong inflows of $5.1 billion this week, TIPS (inflation-protected U.S. Treasury bonds) funds drew record inflows of $1.5 billion in a sign investors were growing more cautious about inflationary pressures.\nStrong flows into financials stocks and big redemptions from real estate investment trusts were also incipient signs of inflation positioning.\nBAML strategists pointed to slowing flows and hesitant price action in credit markets as signs of strain. “Credit is ‘glue’ keeping cross-asset bull market together,” they wrote, labeling the market a “clear bear catalyst”.\nIssues including a potential U.S. government shutdown, NAFTA negotiations, and oil prices were noise to worry about, strategists said, but they wouldn’t affect bullish positioning unless they dented earnings or translated into higher rates.\nHaving pushed back their prediction for a big market correction for month after month last year, BAML’s strategists didn’t put a new date on the long-awaited sell-off.\nFeedback from clients pointed to a correction occurring only when real GDP forecasts, wage inflation and 10-year U.S. Treasury yields all rise above 3 percent and the S&P 500 reaches 3,000 points, they said.\nIn the meantime “frothy price action could continue,” strategists concluded, adding that their bull and bear indicator of market sentiment had risen to 7.4, near a sell signal.\nReporting by Helen Reid; Editing by Keith Weir\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-01-19T20:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-19T14:14:38.014+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
