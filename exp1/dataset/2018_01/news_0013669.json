But under Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, whose nationalist party has long admired Israel for its tough approach to terrorism, ties have flowered across the economy.\n“We have had diplomatic relations for 25 years, but something different is happening now,” Netanyahu said soon after the two sides signed nine agreements covering cooperation in cyber security, space and oil and gas exploration.\nIsrael has given initial approval for Indian energy companies to explore oil and gas in the eastern Mediterranean, in the first such move by Indian firms in that region.\nNetanyahu, who said he saw a “kindred spirit” in Modi in terms of getting things done, pushed for a free trade pact with Asia’s third largest economy during the talks on Monday.\nModi agreed to open trade discussions, Indian foreign ministry secretary in charge of economic relations Vijay Gokhale told reporters. “A delegation from the commerce ministry will actually go next month for discussions on trade,” he said.\nBilateral trade has jumped from $200 million in 1992, when the two countries opened diplomatic relations, to $4.16 billion in 2016, largely in favor of Israel.\nIndia's Prime Minister Narendra Modi speaks as his Israeli counterpart Benjamin Netanyahu looks on during a signing of agreements ceremony at Hyderabad House in New Delhi, India January 15, 2018.

It has offered to transfer technology and eventually build the missile with a local partner in a boost for Modi’s signature Make-in-India drive for a domestic defense base.\nWithout referring to the anti-tank missile deal, Modi said he had invited Israeli companies to take advantage of India’s liberalised rules in the defense sector to “make more in India with our companies.”\nLast year, Modi made a first trip to Israel by an Indian prime minister ever.\n(This version of the story has been refiled to delete reference to Tel Aviv in first paragraph)\nAdditional reporting by Nidhi Verma; editing by Mark Heinrich, William Maclean\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-15T16:11:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-15T16:22:04.033+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
