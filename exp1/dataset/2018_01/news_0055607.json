(NYSE: BXP) , the largest public owner and developer of office buildings in the United States, reported results today for the fourth quarter ended December 31, 2017.\nResults for the quarter ended December 31, 2017\nNet income attributable to common shareholders was $103.8 million compared to $147.2 million for the quarter ended December 31, 2016.

Net income attributable to common shareholders for the quarter ended December 31, 2016 includes a gain on sale of investment in unconsolidated joint venture of approximately $59.4 million, or $0.35 per share basic and $0.34 per share on a diluted basis.

FFO of $1.49 per share diluted was lower than the mid-point of the Company’s guidance previously provided of $1.53 - $1.54 per share diluted primarily due to: $0.08 per share due to a loss from early extinguishment of debt; $0.03 per share due to better than expected portfolio operations; and $0.01 per share due to better than expected development and management services revenue.\nThe Company updated its guidance for full year 2018 EPS and FFO per share as follows:\nProjected EPS (diluted) for 2018 updated to $3.24 - $3.37 per share from $2.55 - $2.71 per share; and Projected FFO per share (diluted) for 2018 updated to $6.23 - $6.36 per share from $6.20 - $6.36 per share.

Net income attributable to common shareholders per share (EPS) was $2.93 basic and $2.93 on a diluted basis, compared to $3.27 basic and $3.26 on a diluted basis for the year ended December 31, 2016. Funds from Operations (FFO) were $959.4 million, or $6.22 per share basic and $6.22 per share diluted. This compares to FFO of $927.7 million, or $6.04 per share basic and $6.03 per share diluted, for the year ended December 31, 2016.\nThe reported results are unaudited and there can be no assurance that these reported results will not vary from the final information for the quarter and year ended December 31, 2017.

The overall percentage of leased space for the 164 properties in service (excluding the Company’s two residential properties and hotel) as of December 31, 2017 was 90.7%.\nSignificant events during the fourth quarter included:\nDevelopment activities\nOn November 17, 2017, the Company partially placed in-service 191 Spring Street, a Class A office redevelopment project with approximately 171,000 net rentable square feet located in Lexington, Massachusetts.

The development agreement provides for the execution of a 75-year ground lease for the property upon completion of the entitlement process and relocation of existing tenants anticipated to occur in 2019.\nCapital markets activities\nOn December 4, 2017, the Company's Operating Partnership completed a public offering of $850.0 million in aggregate principal amount of its 3.200% unsecured senior notes due 2025. The notes were priced at 99.757% of the principal amount to yield an effective rate (including financing fees) of approximately 3.350% per annum to maturity. The notes will mature on January 15, 2025, unless earlier redeemed. The aggregate net proceeds from the offering were approximately $841.1 million after deducting underwriting discounts and transaction expenses. On December 17, 2017, the Company's Operating Partnership completed the redemption of $850.0 million in aggregate principal amount of its 3.700% senior notes due November 15, 2018. The redemption price was approximately $865.5 million. The redemption price included approximately $2.8 million of accrued and unpaid interest to, but not including, the redemption date. Excluding the accrued and unpaid interest, the redemption price was approximately 101.49% of the principal amount being redeemed. The Company recognized a loss from early extinguishment of debt totaling approximately $13.9 million, which amount included the payment of the redemption premium totaling approximately $12.7 million. On December 18, 2017, the Company declared a regular quarterly cash dividend of $0.80 per share of common stock for the period from October 1, 2017 to December 31, 2017, payable on January 30, 2018 to shareholders of record as of the close of business on December 29, 2017. This represents an increase of approximately 6.7%, or $0.05 per share, over the most recent quarterly cash dividend of $0.75 per share.\nTransaction completed subsequent to December 31, 2017:\nOn January 9, 2018, the Company completed the sale of its 500 E Street, S.W. property located in Washington, DC for a net contract sale price of approximately $118.6 million. After adjusting for outstanding lease related costs assumed by the buyer, the gross sale price was approximately $127.6 million. 500 E Street, S.W. is an approximately 262,000 net rentable square foot Class A office property. The property is 100% leased with 21% expecting to vacate in February 2019. On January 24, 2018, the Company entered into a lease agreement with a tenant for a build-to-suit project with approximately 276,000 net rentable square feet of Class A office space at the Company's 17Fifty development project located in Reston, Virginia. The Company expects that the building will be complete and available for occupancy during the first quarter of 2020.\nEPS and FFO per Share Guidance:\nThe Company’s guidance for the first quarter and full year 2018 for EPS (diluted) and FFO per share (diluted) is set forth and reconciled below. Except as described below, the estimates reflect management’s view of current and future market conditions, including assumptions with respect to rental rates, occupancy levels and the earnings impact of the events referenced in this release and otherwise referenced during the conference call referred to below. The estimates do not include possible future gains or losses or the impact on operating results from other possible future property acquisitions or dispositions, other possible capital markets activity or possible future impairment charges. EPS estimates may be subject to fluctuations as a result of several factors, including changes in the recognition of depreciation and amortization expense and any gains or losses associated with disposition activity. The Company is not able to assess at this time the potential impact of these factors on projected EPS. By definition, FFO does not include real estate-related depreciation and amortization, impairment losses on depreciable real estate or gains or losses associated with disposition activities. There can be no assurance that the Company’s actual results will not differ materially from the estimates set forth below.\nAs set forth below, the Company has updated its projected EPS (diluted) for the full year 2018 to $3.24 - $3.37 per share from $2.65 - $2.81 per share. This is an increase of approximately $0.58 per share at the mid-point of the Company’s guidance consisting of $0.56 per share related to gains on the sale of real estate, lower interest expense of $0.04 per share and $0.03 per share of better than expected portfolio performance. These items are offset by an unbudgeted asset sale in January 2018 that the Company expects will result in a decrease of ($0.05) per share.\nIn addition, the Company has updated its projected guidance for FFO per share (diluted) for the full year to $6.23 - $6.36 per share from $6.20 - $6.36 per share. This is an increase of approximately $0.02 per share at the mid-point of the Company’s guidance and results from $0.03 per share of better than expected portfolio performance and lower expected interest expense of $0.04 per share. These items are offset by the unbudgeted asset sale in January 2018 projected to result in a decrease of ($0.05) per share.\nFirst Quarter 2018 Full Year 2018 Low - High Low - High Projected EPS (diluted) $ 1.15 - $ 1.17 $ 3.24 - $ 3.37 Add: Projected Company Share of Real Estate Depreciation and Amortization 0.88 - 0.88 3.55 - 3.55 Less: Projected Company Share of Gains on Sales of Real Estate 0.56 - 0.56 0.56 - 0.56 Projected FFO per Share (diluted) $ 1.47 - $ 1.49 $ 6.23 - $ 6.36 Boston Properties will host a conference call on Wednesday, January 31, 2018 at 10:00 AM Eastern Time, open to the general public, to discuss the fourth quarter and full year 2017 results, the 2018 projections and related assumptions, and other matters that may be of interest to investors.

National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts (“NAREIT”), we calculate Funds from Operations, or “FFO,” by adjusting net income (loss) attributable to Boston Properties, Inc. common shareholders (computed in accordance with GAAP) for gains (or losses) from sales of properties, impairment losses on depreciable real estate consolidated on our balance sheet, impairment losses on our investments in unconsolidated joint ventures driven by a measurable decrease in the fair value of depreciable real estate held by the unconsolidated joint ventures and real estate-related depreciation and amortization. FFO is a non-GAAP financial measure, but we believe the presentation of FFO, combined with the presentation of required GAAP financial measures, has improved the understanding of operating results of REITs among the investing public and has helped make comparisons of REIT operating results more meaningful. Management generally considers FFO and FFO per share to be useful measures for understanding and comparing our operating results because, by excluding gains and losses related to sales of previously depreciated operating real estate assets, impairment losses and real estate asset depreciation and amortization (which can differ across owners of similar assets in similar condition based on historical cost accounting and useful life estimates), FFO and FFO per share can help investors compare the operating performance of a company’s real estate across reporting periods and to the operating performance of other companies.\nOur computation of FFO may not be comparable to FFO reported by other REITs or real estate companies that do not define the term in accordance with the current NAREIT definition or that interpret the current NAREIT definition differently.\nIn order to facilitate a clear understanding of the Company's operating results, FFO should be examined in conjunction with net income attributable to Boston Properties, Inc. common shareholders as presented in the Company's consolidated financial statements. FFO should not be considered as a substitute for net income attributable to Boston Properties, Inc. common shareholders (determined in accordance with GAAP) or any other GAAP financial measures and should only be considered together with and as a supplement to the Company's financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP.\nBOSTON PROPERTIES, INC.\nPORTFOLIO LEASING PERCENTAGES\n% Leased by Location December 31, 2017 December 31, 2016 Boston 94.1 % 90.7 % New York 86.9 % 90.2 % San Francisco and Los Angeles 89.3 % 89.8 % Washington, DC 91.3 % 89.9 % Total Portfolio 90.7 % 90.2 %\nView source version on businesswire.com : http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180130006478/en/\nBoston Properties, Inc.\nMichael LaBelle, 617-236-3352\nExecutive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer\nor\nArista Joyner, 617-236-3343\nInvestor Relations Manager\nSource: Boston Properties, Inc.", "external_links": ["http://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.bostonproperties.com&esheet=51751008&newsitemid=20180130006478&lan=en-US&anchor=www.bostonproperties.com&index=2&md5=d3ce4fafab1979ed35cf53f98a760a39", "http://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.bostonproperties.com&esheet=51751008&newsitemid=20180130006478&lan=en-US&anchor=Boston+Properties%2C+Inc.&index=1&md5=9b870e658ce65efc417eaf35f404e0a3", "http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180130006478/en/", "http://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.bostonproperties.com&esheet=51751008&newsitemid=20180130006478&lan=en-US&anchor=www.bostonproperties.com&index=3&md5=2ea8da8f965319c6ab194cc9ae6c2cc4"], "published": "2018-01-31T02:10:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-31T02:08:57.002+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
