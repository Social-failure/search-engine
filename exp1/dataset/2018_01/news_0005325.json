The company will also continue to source its mint and mustard locally, it said.\nThe move comes as British businesses prepare for the country’s exit from the European Union, and as Unilever also reviews its dual-headed Anglo-Dutch structure.\n“The government is disappointed Unilever has decided to close its Norwich plant, though we welcome Unilever’s commitment to mustard milling and mint production in Norwich,” a spokesman for the British government said, adding that it will work closely with the company, local government officials and unions throughout the consultation period.\nJeremiah Colman began selling mustard near Norwich in 1814. His great-nephew Jeremiah James Colman established the factory there in 1858. Unilever acquired the business in 1995 from what is now Reckitt Benckiser ( RB.L ).\nReporting by Martinne Geller, editing by David Evans and Adrian Croft\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-01-04T23:57:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-07T00:00:55.024+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
