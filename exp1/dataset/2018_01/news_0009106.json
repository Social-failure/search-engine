Courtland team members will join SRE and continue to operate out of Courtland’s Cleveland office.\n“The integration of Courtland and its highly talented team of professionals with StepStone Real Estate will ensure that we continue to deliver the highest quality customized investment solutions to our clients as we expand our global client base and product and service offerings,” said Jeff Giller, Partner and Head of SRE. “Courtland’s founder, Michael Humphrey, was an icon in our industry, with exceptionally high standards and an impeccable reputation that helped to shape the institutional real estate world into what it is today. We intend to honor Michael’s legacy by maintaining the high standards and fiduciary orientation that we believe are shared by StepStone and Courtland.”\n“We are extremely pleased to be adding a firm of the quality and reputation of Courtland to the StepStone platform,” said Monte Brem, StepStone’s founder and Chief Executive Officer. “Merging Courtland into StepStone Real Estate is a reflection of our deep dedication to continuing to build an exceptional real estate practice as we serve our clients across all private market sectors.”\n“SRE and StepStone’s greater global footprint will enhance Courtland’s ability to provide its clients advice on international real estate opportunities,” said Mr. Novick. “When evaluating potential strategic alternatives for Courtland, first and foremost in our consideration was how our potential options would benefit our clients.
