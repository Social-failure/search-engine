It led the way for several Mexican states to allow same-sex marriage, and was first to offer women abortions in most cases.\nSalomon Chertorivski, who is seeking the nomination of the Party of the Democratic Revolution (PRD) for the post of mayor of Mexico City, gestures during an interview with Reuters in Mexico City, Mexico, January 3, 2018. REUTERS/Daniel Becerril “I am sure that this discussion will have the same luck,” Chertorivski said.\nMexico has softened its drug laws in recent years, decriminalizing possession of small amounts of several drugs, although it retains harsh penalties for larger quantities.\nSlideshow (3 Images) Recreational marijuana is still broadly prohibited, but in 2015 the Supreme Court granted four plaintiffs the right to grow their own marijuana for personal consumption on human rights grounds. The country legalized the use of marijuana for medical and scientific needs in June.\nThose milestones have helped stir debate in Mexico, where violent drug cartels have contributed to a death toll of at least 140,000 people over the past decade.\nChertorivski said legalizing cultivation would take business away from illegal gangs and keep marijuana users from drifting into criminal activity. He also proposed more than doubling the minimum wage to reduce crime.\nDespite the trend toward legalization north of the border, cartels still make millions of dollars from smuggling marijuana into the United States.\nReporting by Frank Jack Daniel, Editing by Rosalba O'Brien\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-04T00:40:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-04T00:53:46.004+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
