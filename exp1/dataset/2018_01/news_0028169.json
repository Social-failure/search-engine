Or maybe even the big one.\nEndeavor Content has acquired the rights to Michael Wolff's No. 1 best-selling book, \"Fire and Fury: Inside the Trump White House,\" and plans to develop it into a TV show or a feature film.\nNo TV network or film studio has been attached to the project.\nA \"Fire and Fury\" adaptation could be the first major dramatic portrayal of the Trump White House. HBO had plans to develop a show from a book by Mark Halperin and John Heilemann about the final days of the 2016 campaign, but that project was canceled after Mr. Halperin was accused of sexual misconduct.\nRead more from The New York Times: \nHuffPost, breaking from its roots, ends unpaid contributions \nTrump hands out 'Fake News Awards,' sans the red carpet \nWeeks after Matt Lauer is ousted, 'Today' changes show's top producer \nNews about the rights to Mr. Wolff's book being acquired was reported by The Hollywood Reporter , and was confirmed by a spokeswoman for Endeavor Content.\nMr. Wolff was expected to be the executive producer of the project, and would be joined by the British television executive Michael Jackson.\nThere is heated competition in television these days for major projects, and \"Fire and Fury\" will most likely attract a lot of interest. Since its publication less than two weeks ago, Mr. Wolff's book has raised questions about Mr. Trump's fitness for office, and helped lead to the banishment of the former chief White House strategist Stephen K. Bannon from the president's circle of advisers.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-18T19:52:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-18T20:18:23.003+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
