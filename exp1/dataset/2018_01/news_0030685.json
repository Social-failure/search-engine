They will now do so on Jan. 29 instead.\nCanada’s foreign ministry confirmed the shift in dates after Canadian and Mexican sources said the three ministers could not meet on Jan. 28 because of logistical reasons.\nProspects for the talks are unclear. Trump told Reuters on Wednesday that terminating NAFTA would result in the “best deal” to revamp the pact, which he blames for Mexico’s large trade surplus with the United States. pnL1N1PD00C]\nTrump is also insistent that Mexico pay for a wall he wants to have erected along the southern U.S. border, a demand he repeated on Thursday.\nMexican Finance Minister Finance Minister Jose Antonio Gonzalez Anaya on Thursday reiterated his government’s opposition to the idea.\n“Mexico will not pay for a wall and it’s not a negotiating stance from Mexico – it’s an issue of national sovereignty and dignity,” he told reporters after talks with Canadian Finance Minister Bill Morneau in Toronto.\n“Our position has been clear from the beginning and will continue to be clear,” he added.\nMorneau, asked how Canada’s government would support businesses if Trump announced the United States was pulling out, said Ottawa was focused on “making sure we continue to be constructive at the table and get to a better NAFTA agreement.”\nReporting by David Ljunggren in Ottawa and Anthony Esposito in Mexico City; Editing by Tom Brown\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-01-19T02:28:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-19T12:30:37.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
