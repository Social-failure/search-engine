They spend a lot of money on poor energy sources like kerosene, diesel and even candles,” said Manoj Sinha, chief executive of Husk Power Systems.\nGrowing investments in mini-grids are evidence they are the “most capital-efficient way to help reach national electrification goals while driving inclusive and sustainable development”, he told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.\nHusk offers its customers a “pay-as-you-go” energy service, using mobile phones and a smart metering system.\nDespite being one of the world’s fastest-growing economies, per capita electricity consumption in India is only about a third of the global average. About 300 million people - a quarter of the population - still live without electricity.\nPrime Minister Narendra Modi has pledged to supply power to every citizen by 2019, but reaching remote villages remains a challenge with high distribution losses.\nMini-grids like Husk’s and those of OMC Power, in which Japan’s Mitsui & Co invested about $9 million last year, are helping narrow the gap in states like Uttar Pradesh and Bihar, which are among the most energy-deficient in India.\nHusk plans to add nearly 300 mini-grids in the South Asian nation over the next four years, Sinha said.\nRenewable energy accounts for 13 percent of India’s total installed capacity, and is key to its electrification plan.\nItaly’s Enel Green Power, Japan’s SoftBank, Taiwan’s Foxconn Technology and Greenko Group, backed by the sovereign wealth funds of Abu Dhabi and Singapore, are among other foreign investors in renewable energy in India, helping lower clean-energy costs.\n“Access to reliable electricity drives development and is essential for job creation, women’s empowerment and combating poverty,” said Gerth Svensson, Swedfund’s chief executive.\nIndia’s ministry for new and renewable energy aims to deploy at least 10,000 mini- and micro-grids in “unserved and under-served parts” of the country, with a combined capacity of 500 megawatts or more by 2021.\nBut the lack of a comprehensive national policy on mini-grids is a major deterrent for investors, said Aruna Kumarankandath at the New Delhi-based Centre for Science and Environment.\nUttar Pradesh is the only state with a mini-grid policy, while Bihar’s renewable energy policy includes mini-grids, she said.\n“Mini-grids still occupy a very small space in the renewable energy sector; their per-unit costs are still quite high, and investments have not been very big,” Kumarankandath said.\n“A comprehensive government policy is needed for the expansion of mini-grids - otherwise for investors there are lots of questions, including exit options for when the areas have adequate grid supply,” she added.\n @rinachandran; editing by Megan Rowling.
