If any competitor can say that he almost collided with another, we will all have a 10-minute penalty.”\nKoolen, a former chief executive of online hotel reservation website booking.com, had complained that double world rally champion and 2010 Dakar winner Sainz had hit his quadbike and failed to stop.\nThere are five stages remaining to be run in the event which started in Lima, Peru, and ends in the Argentine city of Cordoba on Jan 20.\nMonday’s ninth stage was canceled as a result of bad weather.\nReporting by Alan Baldwin, editing by Pritha Sarkar\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-01-16T06:06:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-16T10:14:19.007+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
