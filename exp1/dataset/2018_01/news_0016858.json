Lawmakers enacted a fiscal 2018 budget in July, but the state still has a $9.1 billion backlog of unpaid bills to vendors and service providers. \nCC Care, a Chicago-based skilled nursing home operator, filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in October, saying in court papers that slow, erratic and low Medicaid payments were having a “disastrous effect” on all nursing homes in the state. \nSome nursing facilities have waited up to nine months to receive their Medicaid payments, which they rely on to cover everything from salaries, rent and food to laundry and medical equipment and services, restructuring experts have told Reuters. \nThe lawsuit against the Illinois Department of Healthcare and Family Services was filed by Generations Health Care Network, Carlyle Healthcare Center, St. Vincent’s Home, Clinton Manor Living Center and Extended Care Clinical. \nAs a result of the state’s reductions in Medicaid reimbursement rates, the five operators said they have substantially limited, or are considering limiting, their participation in the Medicaid program. This will “severely curtail” Medicaid patients’ access to nursing care services, they said.
