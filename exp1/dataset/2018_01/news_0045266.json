But the government has insisted it is respecting due process and that the companies of detained businessmen will continue operating normally. \nThe allegations, which could not be verified, include kickbacks, inflating government contracts, extortion and bribery. \nThe Ritz is expected to reopen for business next month, and official sources have told Reuters that the authorities were close to winding up a major part of the crackdown. Riyadh hopes to recover about $100 billion of illicit funds and expects a small number to be prosecuted. \nIn late November, senior Saudi Prince Miteb bin Abdullah, once seen as a leading contender to the throne, was freed after reaching a settlement with authorities that involved paying more than $1 billion, according to a Saudi official. \nAnother top businessman who has been held at the Ritz-Carlton is billionaire Prince Alwaleed bin Talal, chairman and owner of global investment firm Kingdom Holding 4280.SE. A Saudi official told Reuters this week that he was negotiating a possible settlement but so far had not agreed on terms. \nThe attorney general’s statement said those who were released are free to move without restrictions.
