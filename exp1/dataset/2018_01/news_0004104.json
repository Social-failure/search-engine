Rising spending in the run up to the elections and lack of revenue reforms slowed the pace of deficit reduction, it said.\nFitch, however, said in October Malaysia’s 2020 target would “require a step-up in consolidation efforts in 2019 and 2020, but is not unattainable.”\nNajib faces his toughest election yet as he looks to counter bad publicity from a corruption scandal involving state-owned fund 1Malaysia Development Berhad (1MDB) and a growing challenge from Mahathir Mohamad, his former mentor turned rival.\nMalaysia’s economy expanded at its fastest pace in more than three years in the third quarter of 2017, a turnaround from 2016 when low oil prices hurt.\nReporting by Liz Lee; Editing by Sam Holmes\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-01-04T12:06:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-04T07:53:38.023+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
