The industrial assets will be sold as part of a global auction.\nAustralia’s near 100-year automotive industry came to end in October after GM shut its plant to move manufacturing to cheaper locations. The closure came a year after Toyota Motor Corp and Ford Motor Co also moved out, eliminating thousands of manufacturing jobs.\nAustralian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull and other lawmakers have met with Gupta, who recently rescued Australian steel maker Arrium’s Whyalla plant and outlined ambitious plans to develop large scale solar and battery projects to help power the plant in South Australia.\nReporting by Sonali Paul; editing by Richard Pullin\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-22T06:25:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-22T07:01:26.011+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
