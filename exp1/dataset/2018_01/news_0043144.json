The same for everyone,” the video says. It features the chain’s mascot holding an oversized coffee mug, a reference to a mug that FCC chairman Ajit Pai has often used. \nA spokeswoman for Pai did not immediately comment. \nLast week, a group of 21 U.S. state attorneys general and the District of Columbia, filed legal papers to challenge the FCC’s decision to do away with net neutrality while Democrats said they needed just one more vote in the U.S. Senate to repeal the FCC ruling. \nRepublicans control both chambers of Congress, so even if Democrats could win a Senate majority, a repeal would also require winning a vote in the House of Representatives and would then still be subject to a likely veto by President Donald Trump who backed the FCC action. \nThe FCC vote handed AT&T Inc, Comcast Corp and Verizon Communications Inc power over what content consumers can access on the internet. \nCompanies including Facebook Inc and Alphabet Inc said they would support a legal challenge through an industry group.
