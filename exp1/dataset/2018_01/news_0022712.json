It's not that we need capital,\" Ben-Zeev said on the sidelines of an event at the exchange, adding that the IPO would be open to retail and institutional investors.\nTASE aims to become competitive, cheaper and more efficient after seeing around 200 de-listings over the past decade and trading volumes slump. In 2017 stock trading averaged 1.4 billion shekels ($412 million) a day, up slightly from 2016 but well below 2 billion shekels in 2010.\nIts 458 listed companies are worth 767 billion shekels.\nBen-Zeev said the IPO would be based on 2018 financial results but the size of the offering would depend on how much of their stakes members opt to sell.\nBy law, no entity may own more than 5 percent of TASE, and the stakes must be sold within five years or ahead of an IPO.\nFirst International Bank of Israel has the largest stake at 20 percent, followed by Bank Hapoalim at around 13 percent and Bank Leumi with nearly 10 percent.\n($1 = 3.4005 shekels) (Editing by Susan Fenton)", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-15T15:50:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-16T09:55:42.001+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
