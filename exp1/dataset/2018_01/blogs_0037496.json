The green light from its sole shareholder: the Saudi government. \n\"In terms of readiness, we are ready. As we always said, the company by the second half of 2018 will be ready,\" Nasser told CNBC in an interview with Andrew Ross Sorkin from the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. \nThe sale of roughly 5 percent of Aramco is expected to value the company at $1 to $2 trillion, making it the largest initial public offering ever. The IPO is the cornerstone of Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman's plan to create the world's largest sovereign wealth fund and diversify Saudi Arabia 's oil-dependent economy. \nBut rumors about delays to the share sale have long swirled, fueled by the slow drip of information on key aspects of the IPO, including where the shares will be listed. Katie Kramer | CNBC Amin Nasser \n\"It is all depending on the shareholder's decisions where to list because we need to coordinate with the other markets when the decision is made,\" Nasser said. \n\"So from our side as a company, we are ready by the second half of this year, and the rest is on the shareholder's hands,\" he said. \nThe IPO is complicated because Aramco underwrites the finances of the kingdom. Investors have wondered how much light the Saudi government will shed on its oil reserves and the future viability of its fossil fuels business. \nThere are also questions about how Saudi Arabia will balance the national priorities and social welfare spending, funded by oil revenues, with Aramco's duty to shareholders as a public company. \nNasser told CNBC in an interview last year he believes the priorities of the Saudi government and Aramco's future shareholders will be in alignment . \nProgramming note: More of Andrew Ross Sorkin's interview with Amin Nasser will air Wednesday morning on \"Squawk Box.\" ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-23T19:14:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-23T19:35:08.023+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
