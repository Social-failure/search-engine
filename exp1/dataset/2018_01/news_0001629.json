Passengers on business often fly between Silicon Valley and Israel, which is one of the largest global tech centers. \n“The acquisition of the Dreamliner enables us to expand our long-haul network,” said David Maimon, El Al’s chief executive. “San Francisco is an important strategic city for El Al, with great emphasis on the business market.” \nIn November, El Al started nonstop flights to Miami from Tel Aviv, after starting flights to Boston in 2015. It also flies nonstop to New York and Los Angeles. \nEl Al also said it was unifying all European flights under the El Al brand and retiring its low-cost brand UP that flew to five destinations in Europe. \nReporting by Steven Scheer, Editing by Ari Rabinovitch\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-03T11:03:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-03T11:17:46.001+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
