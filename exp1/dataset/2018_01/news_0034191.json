Bunge controls 27 percent of the oilseed crush market there, while ADM has 10 percent, according to data from Credit Suisse. \nJP Morgan analyst Ann Duignan also said Bunge’s processing capacity outside of the United States would likely be considered “prize assets” for ADM. \nADM and Bunge shares rose 4.4 percent and 5.9 percent, respectively, on Monday. \nBunge had rebuffed an acquisition offer from Glencore Plc ( GLEN.L ) last year, but Heather Jones, analyst for Vertical Group, placed the odds of a Bunge takeover above 50 percent after ADM’s approach. \nShe said a bigger bet by ADM on oilseeds could pay off as that market grows over time - presenting a simpler path to improved returns than a lengthy strategic overhaul. \n“Arguably the most bullish longer-term theme in the agribusiness sector is global vegetable protein demand,” she said.
