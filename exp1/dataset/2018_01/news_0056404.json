I am as appalled as you all are,” Denner said.\nThe best way to tackle pollution is to return to a fact-based debate about its causes, but that effort has suffered a significant setback due to the news of the study involving monkeys, he said.\nReporting by Edward Taylor; Editing by Maria Sheahan\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-01-30T17:12:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-31T16:42:14.004+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
