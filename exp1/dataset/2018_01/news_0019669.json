We will fight them until the end, until we have secured our territory,” he added. \nResidents reported the sounds of gunfire and explosions in Beni on Saturday. \nRival militia groups control parts of eastern Congo long after the official end of a 1998-2003 war in which millions of people died, mostly from hunger and disease. \nA surge in militia violence across the country, which followed President Joseph Kabila’s refusal to step down when his mandate expired just over a year ago, has raised fears Congo could slide into all-out war again. \nThe Islamist ADF has long been active along the Congo-Uganda border and has been blamed for a spate of massacres. Last month Uganda launched air strikes and artillery attacks on ADF positions on its side.
