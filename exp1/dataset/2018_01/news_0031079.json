Here’s what we know so far. \nWHO‘S INVOLVED? \nAmong the 14 men charged, there are 11 Singaporeans and three Vietnamese. \nEight of the Singaporeans were employees of Shell Eastern Petroleum (Pte) Ltd, the Singapore subsidiary of Royal Dutch Shell Plc, while two others worked for Sentek Marine & Trading Pte, one of Singapore’s biggest marine fuel suppliers. \nSentek Marine said the suspects were its marketing and operations manager and a cargo officer. The cargo officer is accused in court documents of receiving stolen goods on a Singapore-owned and -flagged ship, Sentek 26. \nThe other Singaporean worked for Intertek, a British-listed company specializing in quality and quantity assurance, including for fuel products. \nThe Vietnamese nationals were charged with receiving stolen property aboard two other ships - Prime South and MT Gaea - both of which are Panama flagged. \nAuthorities have arrested 20 people in connection with the case, sources close to the matter said. WHAT WAS STOLEN AND WHEN? \nThe court documents list thefts on several dates going back to July 2017, many of which happened during the refinery’s normal working hours and involved millions of dollars’ worth of gasoil. \nBelow is a list of the dates of the incidents and the amount and value of gasoil reportedly stolen. In some cases, currency conversions have been done by Reuters. \n* July. 24, 765 metric tonnes valued at S$252,558 \n* Oct. 2, 1,131 metric tonnes valued at $579,445 (S$765,273) \n* Oct. 23, 1,276 metric tonnes at $653,733 (S$863,385) \n* Nov. 11, 300 metric tonnes (S$165,000) \n* Nov. 14, 846 metric tonnes (S$465,520) \n* Nov. 21, 2,322 metric tonnes (S$1,277,430) \n* Dec. 1, 1,133 metric tonnes at $639,726 (S$847,317) \n* Dec. 31, 1,076 metric tonnes (S$592,295) \n* Dec. 31, 1,349 metric tonnes (S$736,445) \n* Jan. 5, 802 metric tonnes (S$437,816) \n* Jan. 7, 1,260 metric tonnes (S$687,960) WHERE WAS THE OIL HEADED? \nThere have been three ships named in court documents as having received the stolen oil - Prime South, Sentek 26 and MT Gaea. \nOver the last three months, those vessels have travelled between ports in Singapore, Vietnam, Thailand and Indonesia, shipping data from Thomson Reuters Eikon show. \nWHAT‘S NEXT? \nSingapore police say investigations are still ongoing. Six of 17 men initially arrested have yet to face charges. \nSome of those charged so far are due back in court on Jan. 22 and Jan. 25, and may face additional charges.
