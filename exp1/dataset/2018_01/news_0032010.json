REUTERS/Antonio Bronic \nFollowing a pair of fortunate draws with Slovenia and Macedonia in their preliminary pool, Germany dug deep to avoid another upset and overpowered the Czechs thanks to eight goals from Steffen Fath and good goalkeeping from Andreas Wolff. \nThe Germans scored six goals without reply to wipe out an 18-16 deficit and Wolff pulled off several stunning saves during the streak, including a penalty by the Czech Republic’s top scorer Ondrej Zdrahala.
