The supplies are scheduled to start in the second quarter of 2018. \n“The two parties have agreed to an adjustment to the price and the volume of LNG supply, thus enabling GAIL to develop incremental gas markets to offtake these volumes, thereby mitigating volume risk,” GAIL said. \nThis is a step for GAIL to diversify its LNG portfolio by spreading price reference indexes across multiple geographies, so as to provide consumers a greater flexibility in service, said Chairman B. C. Tripathi. \nThe company has also signed contracts for sourcing up to 5.8 million tonnes of LNG from the United States. \nIt is renegotiating its LNG purchase deals with U.S.-based Cheniere Energy and Dominion Cove Point, Oil Minister Dharmendra Pradhan told lawmakers last month.
