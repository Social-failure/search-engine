Horvath left that team in May and began later that month at Facebook's social virtual reality unit, according to a representative from Oculus.\nHe noted in a Facebook post that his invention had made it into the real world:\nStory Studio, which Facebook closed last year, was nominated for an Emmy for the VR film \"Dear Angelica.\" Horvath won an Emmy for an earlier Oculus film called \"Henry.\"\nFacebook shuttered the unit after deciding it didn't want a stand-alone studio.. \nAccording to Facebook, Flick \"is the smallest time unit which is LARGER than a nanosecond.\"\nCorrection: This article has been updated to reflect that Christopher Horvath began working with Facebook's social virtual reality unit in May, according to a representative from Oculus.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-23T02:22:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-23T02:22:41.004+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
