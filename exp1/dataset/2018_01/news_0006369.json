They all received their state licenses to sell on Friday.\nOne of them, Apothecarium, held a ribbon-cutting ceremony with local politicians and even offered a 20 percent discount for people who brought their mothers.\nEliot Dobris, head of community outreach at Apothecarium, says the business wanted to show that dispensaries are \"respectable places that you can be proud to bring your mom to.\"\nRecreational marijuana became legal in California on Monday, but some municipalities hadn't authorized shops in time for them to sell right away.\n8:45 a.m.\nThis week's announcement that the U.S. Department of Justice would lift its hands-off approach to states that legalized marijuana shocked many in the industry who have been trying to go legit.\nMarijuana stocks plunged and investors fretted in the hours immediately after U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions made the move.\nBy the weekend, though, cooler heads prevailed and many in the industry say they are waiting for the smoke to clear before determining if significant changes are coming.\nLongtime marijuana operators say Sessions' action was merely symbolic and they expect it to be business as usual.\nSessions provided no details other than saying individual U.S. attorneys are authorized to prosecute marijuana operators as they choose.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-06T20:29:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-07T03:41:21.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
