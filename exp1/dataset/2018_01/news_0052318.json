(\"Veritex\" or \"the Company\") (Nasdaq:VBTX), the holding company for Veritex Community Bank (\"Veritex Bank\"), today announced the year end results including record year over year earnings and growth. The Company ended the year with strong capital levels and is poised to further leverage its capital position. Net income available to common stockholders was $4.4 million for the fourth quarter of 2017, a decrease of $0.8 million from the third quarter of 2017, and an increase of $1.2 million from the fourth quarter of 2016. Net income available to common stockholders for the year ended December 31, 2017 was $16.2 million, up $3.7 million, or 29.2%, from the year ended December 31, 2016. Net income for the quarter and year ended December 31, 2017 were negatively impacted by a $1.9 million re-measurement of our deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities due to our new effective tax rate under the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the \"Tax Act\").\nAs part of how we measure our results, we use certain non-GAAP financial measures to ascertain performance. These non-GAAP financial measures are reconciled in the section labeled “Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures” at the end of this press release.\nC. Malcolm Holland, the Company’s Chairman and Chief Executive Officer said, “I am delighted with our accomplishments this year. Our company has grown from $1.4 billion in assets at December 31, 2016 with 11 branches in the Dallas market to $3.0 billion in assets at December 31, 2017 with 21 continuing branches in the Dallas, Fort Worth and Houston markets.\"\nMr. Holland continued \"The fourth quarter has been a particularly busy time for our company, even by Veritex standards. We completed the acquisition of Liberty Bancshares, Inc. and continued to manage cost savings by closing two redundant branches and we sold two Austin area branches on January 1, 2018, thus exiting that market. We continued to increase earnings per share, significantly grew the balance sheet, and were recognized once again as one of the best places to work.\"\nMr. Holland concluded, \"I am excited about 2018 and the opportunities that are ahead of us. Our staff continues to be the reason why we stand apart from the competition. With continued focus on our employees and the Veritex culture, we will be able to achieve the goals we have set for ourselves in 2018.\"\n2017 Fourth Quarter Highlights\nNet income available for common stockholders for the quarter ended December 31, 2017 was $4.4 million, or $0.19 diluted earnings per share (\"EPS\"), compared to $5.1 million, or $0.25 diluted EPS, for the quarter ended September 30, 2017. Core net income available for common stockholders totaled $5.4 million, or $0.23 core diluted EPS, for the quarter ended December 31, 2017, compared to $5.6 million, or $0.28 core diluted EPS, for the quarter ended September 30, 2017. The decrease in core net income available for common stockholders is primarily due to an increase in the provision for loan losses further discussed in the \"Asset Quality\" section of this release. Net income available for common stockholders for the quarter ended December 31, 2017 was impacted by an income tax charge of $1.9 million related to the re-measurement of our deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities at our new expected tax rate due to the enactment of the Tax Act. Net interest margin (\"NIM\") improved to 4.24% and core NIM improved to 3.75% for the quarter ended December 31, 2017, compared to a NIM of 3.78% and core NIM of 3.66% for the third quarter of 2017. Total loans increased $352.3 million, or 18.5%, to $2.3 billion compared to the third quarter of 2017. Excluding acquired loans from the Liberty acquisition, loans grew $39.7 million, or 13.8% annualized. Total deposits increased $357.3 million, or 18.0%, to $2.3 billion compared to the third quarter of 2017. In November 2017, Veritex Bank was named in the list of The Dallas Morning News’ Top 100 Places to Work 2017.\nFull Year 2017 Highlights\nNet income available for common stockholders for the year ended December 31, 2017 was $16.2 million, or $0.86 diluted EPS, compared to $12.6 million, or $1.13 diluted EPS, for the year ended December 31, 2016.\nCore net income available for common stockholders totaled $17.9 million, or $0.95 core diluted EPS, for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to $12.6 million, or $1.13 core diluted EPS, for the year ended December 31, 2016.\nTotal loans as of December 31, 2017 grew $1.3 billion, or 127.8%, compared to December 31, 2016. Excluding acquired loans from Sovereign and Liberty of $1.1 billion, loans grew $203.0 million, or 20.5% compared to December 31, 2016.\nNoninterest-bearing deposits as of December 31, 2017, which includes branch deposits held for sale, increased $324.6 million, or 99.1%, compared to December 31, 2016.\nClosed acquisitions with Sovereign Bancshares, Inc. (\"Sovereign\") on August 1, 2017 and Liberty Bancshares, Inc. (\"Liberty\") on December 1, 2017.\nCompleted a public offering of 2,285,050 shares of common stock with net proceeds of $56.7 million.\nReceived American Bankers' \"Best Bank to Work For\" for the fourth consecutive year.\nResult of Operations for the Three Months Ended December 31, 2017\nNet Interest Income\nFor the three months ended December 31, 2017, net interest income before provision for loan losses was $25.8 million and net interest margin was 4.24% compared to $19.1 million and 3.78%, respectively, for the three months ended September 30, 2017. The $6.7 million increase from the three months ended September 30, 2017 was primarily due to an increase in interest income on loans, which was driven by increased volume in all loan categories resulting from loans acquired from Liberty on December 1, 2017, and continued organic loan growth. Net interest margin increased 46 basis points from the three months ended September 30, 2017, primarily due to a change in mix of earnings assets resulting from increases in loans, which tend to yield greater interest rates than other interest earning assets. Average loan balances represented 84.3% of average interest-earning assets for the three months ended December 31, 2017 compared to 81.9% for the three months ended September 30, 2017.\nNet interest income before provision for loan losses increased by $15.3 million from $10.5 million to $25.8 million for the three months ended December 31, 2017 compared to the same period during 2016. The increase in net interest income before provision for loan losses was primarily driven by higher loan balances resulting from loans acquired from Sovereign and Liberty and continued organic loan growth. For the three months ended December 31, 2017, average loan balances increased by $1.1 billion compared to the three months ended December 31, 2016, which resulted in a $16.5 million increase in interest income. Net interest margin increased 80 basis points from the three months ended December 31, 2016 primarily due to a change in mix of earnings assets resulting from increased loan balances as well as benefits of increases in the prime rates in new and renewed loans. Average loan balances represented 84.3% of average interest-earning assets for the three months ended December 31, 2017 compared to 79.9% for the three months ended December 31, 2016.\nNoninterest Income\nNoninterest income for the three months ended December 31, 2017 was $2.3 million, an increase of $321 thousand compared to the three months ended September 30, 2017. The net increase was primarily due to a $267 thousand gain on the sale of an other real estate owned property during the fourth quarter of 2017 with no corresponding sale in the third quarter of 2017. In addition, the increase was due to $138 thousand of rental income resulting from the purchase of our headquarter building on December 6, 2017 and an increase of $100 thousand in dividend income as a result of bi-annual Federal Reserve Bank stock dividends. This increase was partially offset by a $136 thousand decrease in gain on sale of SBA loans.\nCompared to the three months ended December 31, 2016, noninterest income grew $474 thousand. The increase was primarily due to the $267 thousand gain on the sale of other real estate owned referenced above with no corresponding sale in the fourth quarter of 2016, a $232 thousand increase in service charges and fees on deposit accounts resulting from the additional acquired Sovereign and Liberty deposit accounts and the associated income from these accounts and $136 thousand of rental income resulting from the purchase of our headquarter building.\nNoninterest Expense\nNoninterest expense was $15.0 million for the three months ended December 31, 2017, compared to $12.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2017, an increase of $2.5 million. The increase was primarily driven by a $1.4 million increase in salaries and employee benefits expense, primarily due to one month of additional salaries and employee benefit expenses related to the addition of full-time equivalent employees associated with the Liberty acquisition which closed on December 1, 2017 and one additional month of salaries and employee benefit expenses for employees associated with the Sovereign acquisition compared to the three months ended September 30, 2017. Due to the Sovereign acquisition closing on August 1, 2017, two months of salaries and employee benefit expense related to Sovereign employees were included for the three months ended September 30, 2017 compared to three months of expense related to Sovereign employees for the three months ended December 31, 2017.\nCompared to the three months ended December 31, 2016, noninterest expense for the three months ended December 31, 2017 increased $8.0 million. The increase was primarily driven by a $3.7 million increase in salaries and employee benefits expense related to the additional full-time equivalent employees as result of the Sovereign and Liberty acquisitions. Additionally, occupancy and equipment expense increased $1.0 million primarily due to the addition of eight owned buildings and eight property leases from the Sovereign and Liberty acquisitions and professional fees increased $770 thousand which were primarily a result of the use of legal and other professional services association with the Sovereign and Liberty acquisitions.\nFinancial Condition\nTotal loans were $2.3 billion at December 31, 2017, an increase of $352.3 million, or 18.5%, compared to the third quarter of 2017 and $1.3 billion, or 127.8%, compared to December 31, 2016. We acquired loans from Sovereign and Liberty with an acquisition date fair value of $752.5 million and $312.6 million, respectively. For the fourth quarter of 2017, excluding acquired loans from the Liberty acquisition, loans grew $39.7 million, or 13.8% annualized.\nTotal deposits were $2.3 billion at December 31, 2017, an increase of $357.3 million, or 18.0%, compared to the third quarter of 2017 and $1.2 billion, or 109.3%, compared the year ended December 31, 2016. We assumed deposits with an acquisition date fair value of $809.4 million and estimated $395.9 million in the Sovereign and Liberty acquisitions, respectively.\nAsset Quality\nOur allowance for loan losses as a percentage of loans was 0.57%, 0.55%, and 0.86% of total loans at December 31, 2017, September 30, 2017, and December 31, 2016, respectively. The allowance for loan losses as a percentage of total loans for each of the three quarters ended was determined by the qualitative factors around the nature, volume and mix of the loan portfolio. The decrease in the allowance for loan loss as a percentage of total loans from December 31, 2016 was attributable to the completion of the Sovereign acquisition on August 1, 2017 and the Liberty acquisition on December 1, 2017, as acquired loans are recorded at fair value.\nThe provision for loan losses for the three months ended December 31, 2017 totaled $2.5 million compared to $752 thousand and $440 thousand for three months ended September 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016, respectively. The increase in provision for loan losses compared to September 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016 was primarily due to the general provision required from an increase of loans acquired through the acquisitions of Sovereign and Liberty that were re-underwritten following completion of the respective acquisitions as well as an increase in organic loan growth. Once an acquired loan undergoes new underwriting and meets the criteria for a new loan, any remaining fair value adjustments are taken into interest income and the loan becomes fully subject to our allowance for loan loss methodology. In addition, a provision of $629 thousand was taken for an energy loan moved into nonperforming status discussed below.\nNonperforming assets totaled $14.4 million, or 0.49%, of total assets at December 31, 2017 compared to $2.6 million, or 0.11%, of total assets at September 30, 2017 and $2.4 million, or 0.17%, of total assets at December 31, 2016. The increase of $11.8 million in nonperforming assets compared to September 30, 2017 was primarily due to the addition of a $13.4 million energy loan resulting from a decline in collateral value and deteriorating performance of the borrower.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nThe Company’s management uses certain non-GAAP (generally accepted accounting principles) financial measures to evaluate its performance. Specifically, the Company reviews and reports core net interest income, core non-interest expense, core net income from operations, core net income, core net income available to common stockholders, core diluted earnings per share, core efficiency ratio, core net interest margin, tangible book value per common share and the tangible common equity to tangible assets ratio. The Company has included in this release information related to these non-GAAP financial measures for the applicable periods presented. Please refer to “Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures” at the end of this release for a reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures.\nBusiness Combinations Measurement Period\nThe measurement period for the Company to determine the fair values of acquired identifiable assets and assumed liabilities for Sovereign and Liberty will end at the earlier of (i) twelve months from the date of the acquisition or (ii) as soon as the Company receives the information it was seeking about facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date or learns that more information is not obtainable. Provisional estimates for bank premises, furniture and equipment, goodwill, intangible assets and deferred taxes have been recorded for the Sovereign acquisition and provisional estimates for loans, bank premises, furniture and equipment, goodwill, intangible assets, deferred taxes and deposits have been recorded for the Liberty acquisition as independent valuations have not been finalized. Changes to provisional estimates could potentially have an impact on the re-measurement of our deferred taxes.\nConference Call\nThe Company will also host an investor conference call to review the results on Tuesday, January 30, 2018 at 8:30 a.m. Central Time.
