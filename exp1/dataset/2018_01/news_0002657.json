We will fight for the rule of law, fight for Hong Kong, fight for the future, fight for the next generations.” \nTwo protesters who dressed up as People’s Liberation Army soldiers said they were concerned about the reach of China’s security apparatus. Others called for full democracy as the only lasting means to safeguard the city’s way of life. \nThe organizers of the march said some 10,000 people had showed up. Police, however, put the figure at 6,200.

But I‘m not feeling positive. I think things will get worse.” \nThe Hong Kong government, in a statement, said it “fully respects the right of Hong Kong people to take part in processions and their freedom of expression”. \nChina’s leader Xi Jinping has said that while Hong Kong enjoys a high degree of autonomy under “one country, two systems”, Beijing still holds supreme authority over the city and won’t tolerate any challenge to its authority.
