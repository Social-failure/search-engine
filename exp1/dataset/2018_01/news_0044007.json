another sign of confidence in the region.\nMost emerging market currencies climbed on Wednesday, with the yuan and South Africa’s rand both touching a more than two-year high as the dollar extended its weakest run since 2010-11.\nSTOCKS DIVIDED MSCI’s world equity index, which tracks shares in 47 countries, hit new highs in a continuation of a long running theme but on Wednesday it was a bit more of a mixed picture.\nWall Street scaled new heights overnight on the back of U.S. President Donald Trump’s tax cuts, which will see J.P. Morgan implement a $20 billion investment plan.\nStock futures pointed to another higher open on Wedneday, up 0.18 percent in European trade.\nBut MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan .MIAPJ0000PUS eased 0.2 percent, having jumped 1.2 percent on Tuesday to an all-time peak.\nEuropean shares were also mixed, with a decline in utility stocks and tumbling tech stocks on fresh Apple worries weighing although a strong update from Novartis NOVN.S provided support.\nThe British pound also powered above $1.41, its highest since the vote to leave the European Union in June 2016, aided by the weak dollar and optimism around Britain’s chances of securing a favourable Brexit deal.\nThe dollar’s decline has been a boon to commodities priced in the currency, with gold edging up to $1,341.81 an ounce .\nOil prices were somewhat more subdued after jumping more than 1 percent on Tuesday when Brent crude hit $70 a barrel for the first time in a week.\nBrent futures was down 7 cents at $69.89, still not far off the three-year high of $70.37 reached on Jan. 15, while U.S. crude was higher 20 cents to $64.67 a barrel.\nFor Reuters Live Markets blog on European and UK stock markets open a news window on Reuters Eikon by pressing F9 and type in ‘Live Markets’ in the search bar (Additional reporting by Wayne Cole in SYDNEY and Marc Jones in LONDON; Editing by Mark Heinrich)\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.", "external_links": ["http://tmsnrt.rs/2egbfVh", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-01-24T20:38:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-24T21:31:04.013+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
