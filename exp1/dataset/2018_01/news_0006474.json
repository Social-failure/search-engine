In fact, those familiar with the situation say Boeing executives are in the midst of putting together a plan to address the concerns of Brazilian leaders while still allowing a potential deal to take place. \nThe issue: assuring Brazil's leadership of the sovereignty of Embraer's defense business. \nBoeing and Embraer need Brazil's blessing before a sale can be completed. That's because the Brazilian government holds \"golden shares\" in Embraer giving it the right to veto strategic decisions at Embraer. \nBoeing executives tell CNBC they have no comment on discussions with Embraer. In late December the aerospace giant and Embraer acknowledged they were in talks. \nWhat's the next step in those negotiations? Sources tell CNBC that Boeing executives hope to meet with government officials in Brazil sometime in the next few weeks. While nothing has been scheduled, those close to the matter say Boeing is hopeful it can structure the deal to assuage the concerns Brazil has about Embraer's defense operations. \nOne possibility: structuring Embraer's military business to ensure the sovereignty concerns of Brazil. In the past, Boeing has set up military subsidiaries in Australia and the United Kingdom to meet specific concerns of those governments. \nNeither Boeing nor Embraer are commenting on a potential price to complete a deal. On Friday, Dow Jones cited sources who say Boeing had informally agreed to pay $28 a share for Embraer, which would be a roughly 30 percent premium to the price of Embraer shares in mid-December.
