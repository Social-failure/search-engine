The best this tournament. I started slow but then I got used to the rhythm. I got used to everything. I played very well,” she said. \n“You never know with her because she has crazy good shots sometimes and also the serve. But I read her serve many times today. I just was very strong on the return.” \nThere was early encouragement for Pliskova as she held an extended opening service game then cracked a forehand winner to earn a break point, which she converted when Halep missed a forehand over the baseline.

I don’t think I did something that wrong. Maybe just the big points I play bad against her, then it changes quickly. \n“I think all the matches we play are pretty similar. I feel she just likes my game.” Reporting by Martyn Herman; Editing by John O'Brien", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-24T08:27:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-24T08:57:03.009+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
