They then set up a third firm to sell shares, saying it would go public in the United States. \nThe court said it had ordered the 21 defendants to return over 5.7 billion yuan to more than 170,000 investors. \nChina has launched a campaign to stamp out pyramid schemes which typically promise people they can get rich by joining and then recruiting new investors. \nCases investigated by Chinese police in the first nine months of 2017 involved nearly 30 billion yuan, the official Xinhua News Agency said in October.
