A law providing for hefty fines for social media companies if they do not remove hate speech quickly enough went into force in Germany this year.\n“I do not hide that I am not in favour of hard regulation because the freedom of speech for me is almost absolute,” Jourova told reporters in December.\n“In case of doubt it should remain online because freedom of expression is (in a) privileged position.”\nOf the hate speech flagged to the companies, almost half of it was found on Facebook, the figures show, while 24 percent was on YouTube and 26 percent on Twitter.\nThe most common ground for hatred identified by the Commission was ethnic origins, followed by anti-Muslim hatred and xenophobia, including expressions of hatred against migrants and refugees.\nFollowing pressure from several European governments, social media companies stepped up their efforts to tackle extremist content online, including through the use of artificial intelligence.\nThe Commission will likely issue a recommendation, a soft law instrument, on how companies should take down extremist content related to militant groups at the end of February, an official said, as it is less nuanced than hate speech and needs to be taken offline more quickly.
