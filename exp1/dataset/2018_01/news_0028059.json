The day after this incident, a young local man stabbed the chief of the traditional hunters,” he said.\nAuthorities declined to release the identity of the dead. The Saudi embassy in Conakry did not respond to a request for comment.\nSaudi Arabia has spent millions of dollars to win converts to its strict form of Islam in Africa and gain influence. That has raised concerns of radicalization, especially in West Africa where the more tolerant Sufi Islam has historically been more dominant.\nGuinea is predominantly Muslim, but many in rural areas have been practicing traditional religions for centuries. In those places the reception to foreign Islamic preachers can be hostile.\nAccording to police spokesman Kasse, the dead Saudi was part of a group of five preachers, including three Guineans and one other Saudi.\nWhen the preaching began, a group of onlookers began to boo, said William Fernandez, the Attorney General of the nearby Kankan Court of Appeal. The preacher tried to escape on a motor bike but was caught and killed, he said.\nThe next day, the man who killed the chief of a group of traditional hunters shouted “Allahu Akbar” (“God is Greatest”, in Arabic) before committing the act, Fernandez said, citing testimony from residents. A man is in custody for the crime.\nReporting By Saliou Samb,; Writing by Edward McAllister, Editing by Angus MacSwan\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-01-19T22:17:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-20T02:56:16.167+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
