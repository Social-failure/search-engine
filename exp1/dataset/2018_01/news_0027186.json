Lebanon still regards Israel as an enemy state. \n“I see no obstacle preventing the film from being shown because it has nothing to do with Lebanon or the conflict with the Israeli enemy,” Interior Minister Nohad Machnouk told Reuters. \nGeorge Hanna, head of the publications department in the ministry’s General Security branch, said the film oversight committee could recommend films be banned if they constitute positive propaganda for Israel among other reasons. \n“The Post” dramatises the 1971 battle by American newspapers to publish leaked documents, known as the Pentagon Papers, concerning the U.S. government’s role in the Vietnam War. \nIn 2017, Lebanon banned two films but permitted 317 commercial and 766 festival films to screen, Hanna said. \nThis year, it has already banned another film, “Jungle”, pulling it from cinemas after several days of screenings. It is based on a book by a former Israeli navy serviceman about his travels in the Amazon rainforest. \nBassam Eid, product manager for Empire Cinemas in Lebanon and distributor of “The Post”, said social media campaigns have started to put more pressure on Lebanon’s government over films. \nLast year Lebanon banned the film “Wonder Woman” over the starring role of the Israeli actor Gal Gadot. \nLebanon is widely seen as a relative bastion of free speech in the Middle East.
