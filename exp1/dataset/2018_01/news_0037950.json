Including E.ON’s stake, shareholders have tendered 46.93 percent of Uniper shares so far.\nReporting by Christoph Steitz and Tom Kaeckenhoff, editing by Vera Eckert\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-01-23T18:33:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-23T17:43:57.002+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
