The following month Apple launched its Airpods after dispensing with the plug-in for jack cables in its iPhone 7. \nGN’s original earphones, tailored for athletes with features to track progress and measure heart rate, sold for $370, twice as much as Apple’s equivalent. \n“Apple has helped develop this market with great speed but now we’re launching a new generation,” Svendsen-Tune said, speaking ahead of the launch of the product at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas. \nIn the first half of 2017 around 900,000 wireless headphone units were sold in the U.S. alone, and since the launch in 2016, Apple has accounted for 85 percent of the sales, according to data from the NPD Group. \nGN said it was in second place but had only a single figure market share. But the market is still evolving and competition is fierce. \n“If we can maintain a second place in 2018, I believe we will have done very well,” Svendsen-Tune said. \nGN’s audio division accounts for 40 percent of the company’s revenue, while the hearing aid division contributes 60 percent. \n($1 = 6.1815 Danish crowns)", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-08T05:03:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-08T05:25:16.015+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
