At the time, BC Partners and Nordic Capital had vied to take control of the group. \nDermapharm makes treatments against skin diseases, insect bites and hair loss, as well as allergy drugs and Tiroler Nussoel-branded sun tan lotion. \n($1 = 0.8185 euros)", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-15T18:26:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-15T18:35:58.001+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
