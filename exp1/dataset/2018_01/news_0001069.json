It did not elaborate.\nLast month, the U.S. House of Representatives gave final approval to the biggest overhaul of the U.S. tax code in 30 years, which included cutting the corporate tax rate to 21 percent from 35 percent.\nCompanies from Goldman Sachs ( GS.N ) to Australia’s Worley Parsons ( WOR.AX ) and Navitas ( NVT.AX ) have detailed the impact of the bill on their financial results.\nShares of Brambles on the Australian Stock Exchange were trading 0.9 percent higher at A$10.16 at 2319 GMT, while the benchmark slipped 0.1 percent.\nReporting by Aaron Saldanha in Bengaluru; Editing by Paul Tait and Stephen Coates\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-02T01:13:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-02T01:29:09.031+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
