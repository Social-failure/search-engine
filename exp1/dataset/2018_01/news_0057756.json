Hanifin, a defenseman coming off his first All-Star Game appearance, drew the penalty that led to the power play.\nRask, a center, has 12 goals this season.\nCarolina improved to 2-13-4 when trailing after two periods this season.\nThe Hurricanes posted their first home victory in January after going 0-3-1 to in Raleigh to start the month.\nPageau’s seventh goal of the season broke a scoreless tie with 1:12 to play in the second period. His shot made it through traffic on the way to the net.\nRask had a prime scoring chance in the waning seconds of the second period but was denied by Anderson.\nAho’s tying goal came on a blast at 1:49 of the third. He was set up by Teuvo Teravainen.\nAho was playing for the first time after a four-game absence because of a concussion and knee injury. He benefitted during that stretch from the team’s bye week and then later the All-Star break.\nThe first period was scoreless as both teams struggled to display much timing, combining for 18 shots.\nThe Hurricanes, who came under new ownership earlier this month, invited all fans to the lower level in an effort to make the arena a more intimate atmosphere. The fans had to wait for the tying and winning goals, but they were treated with the desired result.\n--Field Level Media\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-01-31T11:11:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-31T16:15:15.006+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
