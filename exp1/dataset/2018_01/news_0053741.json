He said he expected to keep full control of his global investment firm Kingdom Holding without being required to give up assets to the government. \nHe also said he had been well treated in detention, describing rumours of mistreatment as completely false. He gave the interview partly in order to disprove such rumours, Prince Alwaleed said.
