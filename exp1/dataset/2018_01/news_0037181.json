REUTERS/Michael Kooren/File Photo “The Dutch have a lot of (professional) teams,” said former Dutch speed skater Bob de Jong, who is currently assistant coach of the South Korean national team.\n“They’re always competing as well outside the skating rink. And during training, well, sometimes they help each other and sometimes they are absolutely not helping each other.”\nDe Jong praised Blokhuijsen’s professionalism and commitment to the sport.\n“I was training in another team and we got the same sponsor so we trained a little bit together,” De Jong said. “I know he is really focused on his weight and focusing on his food level and energy level.”\nThat focus helped Blokhuijsen overcome a broken ankle in May last year that could have thrown his preparations for the upcoming Games into disarray.\nSuch is Blokhuijsen’s importance to the Dutch team that Verweij called for him to be given a place in the Olympic squad when it looked like his participation might be in doubt.\n“It’s simple. Sven Kramer, Jan Blokhuijsen and I know what to do on the team pursuit, so I think we should stay there,” Verweij was Quote: d as saying by Dutch online newspaper NU.nl in early December.\n“We should not suddenly make crazy changes.”\nVerweij’s call was heeded by selectors two weeks later, when the Dutch named the same trio of skaters who won gold in Sochi to their team pursuit squad for the Games in South Korea.\nEditing by Peter Rutherford\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-22T15:12:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-22T15:29:10.004+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
