The Zaragoza plant in northeastern Spain employs around 5,300 people and ran at 80 percent capacity last year. \nThe group is “convinced that the employees will understand the need to secure the future of the site through the performance plan, which will pave the way for new investments and projects,” it added. \nPSA gave no details of the five-year framework agreement, which local newspaper Heraldo said provides for a wage freeze for 2018 followed by increases at half the level of inflation and a 5 percent cut to overtime pay. \nUnion sources said late on Monday that an accord was reached after more than 12 hours of talks and shortly before a deadline imposed by PSA.
