Samad said his movement was ready to give concessions in any political talks in order to stop the bloodshed.\nYemen, one of the Arab world’s poorest countries, is embroiled in a proxy war between the Houthi armed movement, allied with Iran, and a U.S.-backed military coalition headed by Saudi Arabia.\nSome 8 million people are on the brink of famine, more than 10,000 have been killed and tens of thousands of others are struggling with cholera, diphtheria and other diseases.\nThe Saudi-led coalition has been trying since the start of the war in March 2015 to capture Hodeidah, Yemen’s biggest port, which receives 80 percent of Yemen’s imports, and has in recent weeks launched a ground campaign and intensified air strikes.\nOn Tuesday, the United Arab Emirates minister of state for foreign affairs, Anwar Gargash, said on Twitter the threats were another proof of “the terrorist nature of the Houthi militias”, especially as Samad was meeting a U.N. delegation. UAE is a major partner of the military coalition fighting the Houthis.\n“The Houthi who decimated crops and seeds, destroyed Yemen, betrayed his ally and partner, is now threatening the international navigation; we are facing a terrorist gang that the end of its existence in Yemen is nigh,” Gargash said.\nReporting by Aziz El Yaakoubi; Editing by Alison Williams\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-09T20:46:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-09T21:01:46.045+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
