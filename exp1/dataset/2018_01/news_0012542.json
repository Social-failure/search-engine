Public and market expectations are considered an important component in inflation outcomes, and Bostic said recent survey evidence \"indicates that individuals may not be completely convinced.\"\n\"This possibility is one factor that might argue for being somewhat more patient in raising rates,\" he said.\nBostic added that the estimated \"neutral\" rate of interest that would keep inflation at target and economic growth at trend may have slipped to \"close to\" 2 percent. If true, it means the Fed could only raise rates two or three more times, from the current range of between 1.25 percent to 1.5 percent, before monetary policy is no longer \"loose\" and encouraging economic activity.\nEven as it raises rates the Fed wants to remain \"accommodative,\" with a federal funds target below neutral.\nWith the Fed also tightening policy by shrinking its balance sheet each month, the central bank \"is approaching a more neutral stance,\" and needs to keep that in mind in setting rates, Bostic said.\nBostic said his outlook incorporates a \"modest\" increase in economic activity from the Trump administration's tax cuts.\nBut he said that among businesses surveyed after the House of Representatives' version of the tax overhaul had been approved, two-thirds or more of larger firms said the changes would not prompt them to expand investment or hiring.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-08T20:17:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-08T20:17:43.039+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
