However, Saudi Arabia, OPEC’s top producer, wants to see crude above $60 to boost the valuation of its national oil company Aramco before an initial public offering of shares this year and to reduce the gap in its state budget, Saudi sources have said.\nOPEC sources say Saudi Arabia has become a strong advocate of higher prices, a shift from a more moderate stance in the past, and Saudi officials have downplayed the threat of a boost in shale production.\nEven so, U.S. production is expected soon to rise above 10 million barrels per day, close to Saudi levels, due largely to soaring output from shale drillers, government data shows. [EIA/M]\nOPEC officials also think the 2018 rally has been mainly driven by unrest in Iran, rather than a tighter balance between supply and demand, giving rise to concern it may not last.\n“Oil prices rose because of the political situation in Iran,” an OPEC source said. “There is a worry now that this would be followed by a sharp decline in prices.”\nA third OPEC source said market fundamentals did not justify the price rally.\n“It is only politics that is changing the mood. The push in prices will mean the peak is near and hence prices will give up some of the gains.”\nWhile OPEC sources say oil market fundamentals remain strong on the back of the supply cuts, others are worried that economic growth in consuming countries could slow and higher prices might encourage some producers to pump above their output target.\nReporting by Rania El Gamal and Alex Lawler; Editing by Dale Hudson\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-09T18:44:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-09T18:59:45.026+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
