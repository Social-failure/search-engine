Pre-existing operators such as Coincheck have been allowed to continue offering services while awaiting approval. Coincheck's application, submitted in September, is still pending.\nCoincheck told a late-Friday news conference that its NEM coins were stored in a \"hot wallet\" instead of the more secure \"cold wallet\", outside the internet. Asked why, company President Koichiro Wada cited technical difficulties and a shortage of staff capable of dealing with them.\nIn 2014, Tokyo-based Mt. Gox, which once handled 80 percent of the world's bitcoin trades, filed for bankruptcy after losing around half a billion dollars worth of bitcoins. More recently, South Korean cryptocurrency exchange Youbit last month shut down and filed for bankruptcy after being hacked twice last year.\nWorld leaders meeting in Davos last week issued fresh warnings about the dangers of cryptocurrencies, with U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin relating Washington's concern about the money being used for illicit activity.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-28T06:08:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-28T06:08:06.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
