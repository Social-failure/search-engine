Attempts by hackers to steal money from ICO projects increased tenfold over the period.\nGroup-IB also took part in a study published this week by Ernst & Young which showed that roughly $400 million of the $3.7 billion raised via ICOs to date had been stolen.\nThe findings come amid a cryptocurrency investing craze, with young companies raising hundreds of millions of dollars online to fund projects, with often little more than a handful of employees and an outline business plan.\nA copy of bitcoin standing on PC motherboard is seen in this illustration picture, October 26, 2017.

REUTERS/Dado Ruvic There is also growing scrutiny from regulators and investors, some of whom say they have been misled or defrauded via ICO schemes.\nGroup-IB said ICOs and cryptocurrency investors were particularly at risk from so-called phishing attacks - when hackers spoof emails and websites to steal passwords and personal information - with some groups who previously targeted banks now stealing as much as $1.5 million a month this way.\nIn some cases, hackers have also attacked and doctored ICO project websites, changing the information so would-be investors send their money to the wrong digital “wallets” used for storing cryptocurrencies.\n“Most attacks use traditional and well-proven techniques, which are also very effective for stealing cryptocurrencies,” said Ruslan Yusufov, director of private client services at Group-IB. “Lots of projects underestimate cybersecurity risks, which leads to an avalanche of threats and successful thefts.”\nReporting by Jack Stubbs; Editing by Alexander Smith\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-24T13:45:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-24T14:04:40.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
