But the Stars needed just 38 seconds to get that goal back as Jamie Benn lit the light after assists from Klingberg and Lindell.\nBenn’s goal chased Lehner, and Johnson was greeted with a goal by Lindell less than three minutes later. Alexander Radulov and Benn got the assists on the score. Finally, the Stars pushed their advantage to 6-1 as Radek Faksa tipped in a shot from Stephen Johns after a pass from Antoine Roussel with 2:29 to play in the second period.\nDallas’ Tyler Pitlick scored the game’s final goal at the 7:24 mark of the third period after assists by Klingberg and Faksa.\nKari Lehtonen started in goal for just the second time in Dallas’ past 15 games and stopped 26 shots to earn the victory. Lehtonen opened the road trip for Dallas on Monday with a 3-2 overtime win against the Boston Bruins.\nBuffalo has lost seven of its past eight games and is mired in last place in the Eastern Conference with the second-worst record in the league.\n--Field Level Media\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-01-21T04:59:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-21T13:20:59.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
