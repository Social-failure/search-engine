If it isn’t, then it destroys the game. The curling stones that we use are designed to curl -- bend -- on the ice. \n“Twenty kilos of granite sliding up the ice is not going to defeat gravity and climb up a hill.” \nModern equipment can measure the level of the ice surface to within 0.01 of a millimeter. \nThen there are the ‘pebbles’, created by sprinkling tiny droplets of water onto the gleaming ice, that freeze instantly and allow the stones to glide and curl in a way they would not otherwise. \n“The roughness of the (stone‘s) running surface and the quality of the pebble will determine how much the stone can curl,” explained Callan. \nThis is because the pebbled surface, which can be likened to the peel of an orange in terms of texture, combines with the stone’s concave bottom to create a micro-layer of water and reduce friction.

REUTERS/Phil Noble/File Photo \nOnly de-ionised water is used, a process that removes any chemicals such as chlorine or fluorine found in tap water. \n“It freezes very quickly and because it freezes so quickly, it freezes very hard. And that makes it ideal to provide a running surface for curling,” said Callan. \nA machine with a blade sharpened to be 100 percent flat and accurate is worked over the ice in pre-determined patterns known as ‘scraping’ to ensure that the surface is completely level. \nAfter this comes the pebbling. And once a game is done, the preparation work starts over. \n“During a game you’ve got up to eight players all sliding about on it (the ice) and sweeping and the stones running up and down,” said Callan. \n“So to make sure it’s fair and equitable all the way across, when a game is finished all of that is scraped off and we start again.” \nEvery building is different, with the number of people likely to be inside also dictating how cold the ice needs to be. Too warm and the pebbles will wear faster, too cold and the stone reacts differently. \n“I’ve just come back from Korea where our outside average temperature was -8 (Celsius) and the air temperature inside the arena was +10 at head height and the ice surface temperature was -5.2,” said Callan. \n“If you’re in an arena and 3,000 people walk in the door all wrapped up in jackets and suddenly all of this heat is inside, you have to be ready for that.” Editing by Amlan Chakraborty", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-16T15:07:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-16T15:31:44.001+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
