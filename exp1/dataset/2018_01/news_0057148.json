Retail shops still operate in the 80s.” \nLuxury goods firms including industry leaders like Louis Vuitton owner LVMH ( LVMH.PA ) or Gucci parent Kering ( PRTP.PA ) have recently made a big push to sell their wares online, launching and revamping e-commerce sites for various labels. \nCartier owner Richemont ( CFR.S ) last week said it would bid for full control of Farfetch’s larger rival, luxury retailer Yoox Net-A-Porter ( YNAP.MI ), as it tries to do more on the web. \nUnlike Yoox, Farfetch does not have to stock inventory. Slideshow (3 Images) LISTING ON THE CARDS? \nOnline sales of high-end items such as shoes, clothing, jewellery, perfumes and handbags should rise to at least a fifth of the luxury goods market by 2025 from 8 percent in 2016, consultants McKinsey said in a report this week. \nNeves did not disclose how much Farfetch was investing in technology, and declined to comment on when the firm would turn a profit or potentially float. \nFarfetch doubled its pool of engineers to just under 1,000 between 2016 and 2017 - out of a total staff of 2,000 - and expects that figure to reach around 1,600 this year, with some 90 engineers working on the “store of the future”, up from 60 now, Neves said. \nAccording to the latest available UK filings, Farfetch revenues increased by 74 percent in 2016 to 151.3 million pounds ($215 million), while net losses widened, to 34 million pounds. \nNeves said in late 2016 that a flotation could be on the cards in two or three years, while investment banks have recently been pitching to work on a possible U.S. listing, two sources familiar with the matter told Reuters this week. \nA fundraising round in 2016 valued the firm at around $1.5 billion. China’s second-biggest e-commerce site, JD.com, has since invested in and partnered with Farfetch. \nChina is one of Farfetch’s fastest growing markets, Neves said.
