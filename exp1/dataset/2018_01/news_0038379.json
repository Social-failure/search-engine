REUTERS/Amit Dave In its request to the court, the government of Rajasthan cited the need to prevent public unrest, in view of sentiment among the Rajput community.\nThe states’ move comes against a backdrop of continued protests by right-wing groups, such as the Shri Rajput Karni Sena, which blocked traffic in parts of northern India on Sunday and shouted slogans demanding for a complete ban on the film.\nMembers of a Rajput community group called the Sarwa Kshatriya Mahasabha in Chhattisgarh have also threatened to disrupt screenings in theatres there.\nThe group plans to hold a protest meeting on Monday in Raipur, the state capital, to warn cinema owners, and will organise a human chain on Wednesday to demand a complete ban.\n“We have already told the cinema-halls not to screen the film,” Rakesh Singh Bais, the group’s president, told Reuters. “If any one does, he will be responsible for the consequences.”\nReporting by Suchitra Mohanty and Jatindra Dash; Writing by Swati Bhat; Editing by Clarence Fernandez\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-22T11:57:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-22T12:12:10.014+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
