Though they remain shy of $64 billion peak reached in August 2008. \nThe index of Nigeria’s top 10 lenders led the charge, rallying 5.3 percent. Diamond Bank, Wema Bank and Sterling Bank each rose more than 9 percent. \nFuel retailer Conoil, Eterna Oil and Champion Brewery gained the maximum 10 percent allowed.
