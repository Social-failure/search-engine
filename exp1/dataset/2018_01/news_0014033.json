Teva said it will provide them with training and counselling to find alternative employment. \nEarlier this month workers from an adjacent tablet plant, which employs 500 people, reached an agreement with Teva on closing that factory by the end of 2019. \nPrime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu had asked the company not to close the Jerusalem site - a request Teva rejected. \nUnder a two-year plan, Teva aims to reduce costs by $3 billion by the end of 2019, from about $16.1 billion in 2017.
