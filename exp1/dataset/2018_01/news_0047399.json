The bathroom, restroom, toilette or loo, as Brits would call it, has a sign on the door that says:\n\"This restroom may be used by any person regardless of gender, identity or expression\"\nThe bathroom is within WEF's Congress Center The inclusive perspective implicit in the bathroom neatly sums up WEF's approach to society, its promotion of gender equality and open-mindedness.\nThe Forum emphasizes that it \"adheres to the principles of independence, impartiality, moral integrity and intellectual integrity\" and that all are welcome.\nWEF was unavailable to comment on whether the bathroom's stance was a new addition to the Forum.\nFollow CNBC International on Twitter and Facebook .", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-25T15:23:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-25T15:40:06.002+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
