(NASDAQ: MRDN) (“Meridian” or the “Company”), an integrated, non-hazardous solid waste services and innovative technology company, is pleased to announce the closing of the acquisition of Wilson Waste Systems, LLC (“Wilson Waste”). The transaction expands Meridian’s footprint in Missouri with environmental service operations in the greater St. Louis marketplace, particularly St. Charles, Lincoln and Warren Counties.\nWilson Waste provides residential and commercial collection and disposal services to approximately 17,000 customers with an employee base of 27 from its sole hauling company located within the City of Warrenton. These operations and employees will immediately be integrated into Meridian Waste’s local Missouri operating systems and team of dedicated waste professionals. Disposal will include 100% internalization into the Company’s Eagle Ridge Landfill in Bowling Green, MO.\n“Wilson Waste has developed a solid base of customers with long-term contracts adding immediate waste volume into our landfill in Bowling Green. This is a classic “tuck-in” acquisition,” said Jeff Cosman, CEO of Meridian Waste. “Over the past year, our operations team in Missouri has consolidated billing systems, accounting systems, routes and new contracts preparing for additional opportunities, like Wilson Waste, in the marketplace. Because of the hard work over the past year building our internal infrastructure, the Company believes Wilson Waste can quickly be consolidated into our operations. The Company’s strategy continues to build internalized volumes into our landfills in Virginia and Missouri, while developing long term objectives with new commercial and residential contracts.”\nAbout Meridian Waste Solutions, Inc.\nMeridian Waste Solutions, Inc.
