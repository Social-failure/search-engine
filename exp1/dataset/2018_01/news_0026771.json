Most Indian companies follow an April-March financial year.\nPrice Waterhouse had appealed to SAT to lift the SEBI ban, but the Tribunal only agreed to give it a reprieve to permit it to complete audits it had already taken on for the 2018 calendar year.\nReporting by Abhirup Roy; Writing by Swati Bhat; Editing by Euan Rocha\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-01-19T15:15:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-20T17:29:17.006+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
