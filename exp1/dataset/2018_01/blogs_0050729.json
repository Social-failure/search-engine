All love. #GRAMMYS.” There was immediate backlash due to Sony’s controversial role in the legal battle between the singer and producer. \nIn 2014, Kesha sued Dr. Luke , claiming that he sexually, physically, verbally, and emotionally abused her. She sought to exit her contract with him and Sony Music via the lawsuit, but Dr. Luke denied the allegations and counter-sued for defamation. In 2016, Kesha dropped the suit. Kesha performs at the 60th Annual GRAMMY Awards at Madison Square Garden on January 28, 2018. Jeff Kravitz FilmMagic \nAmid the legal battle, Sony Music was criticized as not doing enough to support Kesha. The label claimed that it was “not in a position to terminate the contractual agreement between Luke and Kesha.” So Kesha is required to record two more albums with Sony before her contract is fulfilled, and Dr. Luke continues to profit from the albums. The only accommodation Sony Music made was letting Kesha “record without any connection, involvement or interaction with Luke whatsoever,” according to a Sony lawyer’s statement to Vox last year.
