The casino billionaire later paid the manicurist a $7.5 million settlement, the Journal reported. \nBeyond that incident, dozens of people the Journal interviewed who have worked at Wynn’s casinos described a pattern of sexual misconduct. \nWynn denied the accusations, saying, “The idea that I ever assaulted any woman is preposterous.” A spokesman for Wynn didn’t immediately return a request for comment on his resignation from the RNC.
