REUTERS/Reem Baeshen In a nod to conservatives, films will be censored to make sure they remain in line with the kingdom’s “moral values”.\nMORE FUN After watching The Emoji Movie with his wife and daughter on Sunday evening, 28-year-old Sultan al-Otaibi said Saudis are happy to see movies in the theatre instead of staying at home.\nSlideshow (5 Images) “It’s more comfortable, more fun to have a change of scenery and an activity on the weekend. It is a step that was very late in coming but thank God it’s happening now.”\nThousands of Saudis currently travel to Bahrain, the United Arab Emirates and other countries for entertainment. The government wants to retain the money spent on those trips.\nThe authorities expect to open 300 cinemas with 2,000 screens by 2030, building an industry it hopes will contribute more then 90 billion riyals ($24 billion) to the economy and create 30,000 permanent jobs.\nRegional and international cinema chains are also eyeing the Saudi market, keen to tap the spending power of the young people who make up roughly 70 percent of the population.\n“I want to see everything because it is something new for Saudi,” said 30-year-old movie-goer Ibtisam Abu Talib. “I hope everything is available - action, romance, children’s films, comedy. Everything, God willing.”\nReporting By Stephen Kalin, editing by Larry King\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-15T09:53:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-15T10:25:40.001+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
