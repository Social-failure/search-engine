For 2018, analysts at L‘Observatoire de l‘Automobile expect registrations to grow 3.8 percent to 2.2 million. \nDiesel-engine cars - which made up three quarters of all French car sales five years ago - made up just 47.29 percent of new registrations last year, from 52 percent in 2016. \nFollowing the Volkswagen “dieselgate” emissions scandal in 2015, many cities and countries have imposed limits or bans on polluting diesel engines. \nElectric vehicles made up 1.18 percent of new registrations in France last year, hybrids 3.8 percent. \nFrench car manufacturers had a 54.5 percent market share last year, up from 53.5 percent in 2016. The PSA group (Peugeot, Citroen) had 29.2 percent share and the Renault group a 25.3 percent share. \nAmong foreign brands, the Volkswagen group (Volkswagen, Audi, Porsche and other brands) had a 12.4 percent market share, followed by Toyota-Lexus with 4.46 percent and the Fiat group (Fiat, Alfa Romeo, Jeep) with 4.23 percent.
