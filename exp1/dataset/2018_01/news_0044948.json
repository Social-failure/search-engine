The 2019 growth outlook was lifted to 1.9 percent from 1.7 percent.\nFor more on the ECB’s survey, click on: here\nReporting by Balazs Koranyi; editing by Ralph Boulton\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://www.ecb.europa.eu/stats/ecb_surveys/survey_of_professional_forecasters/html/index.en.html"], "published": "2018-01-26T17:02:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-26T11:26:26.015+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
