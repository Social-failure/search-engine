It is also expected to include euro tranches, they added. \nA $13 billion financing would give leverage of around 7.5 times, based on last 12 months Ebitda of approximately $1.7 billion for the F&R unit. Senior leverage of roughly 4.5-5.0 times could give a loan of $8 billion - $9 billion, and junior debt of $4 billion - $5 billion, sources said. \nAnother source familiar with the matter said that leverage was expected to be below 6.0 times. \nAlthough the size of the financing is challenging, liquid banks and investors are eager to lend to new buyouts as the strong level of global demand continues to exceed supply. \n“The market capacity for Europe is about €5 billion between loans and bonds and in the U.S. is $10 billion - $15 billion, so if there is a big deal that pushes capacity and the business has revenue globally it would make sense to have euro and dollars in loans and bonds to create a competitive dynamic in order to get best execution,” a senior banker said. \nIt is the largest LBO loan financing since 2013 when ketchup maker HJ Heinz raised a $14.1billion financing to back its buyout by Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway and 3G Capital. \nThomson Reuters and Blackstone declined to comment. \nThomson Reuters’ board is expected to meet on Tuesday to discuss Blackstone’s offer for the F&R business, which supplies news, data and analytics to banks and investment houses around the world. The unit contributes more than half of Thomson Reuters’ annual revenues. \nUnder the terms of the Blackstone offer, Thomson Reuters would retain a 45% stake in the F&R business in partnership with the US buyout firm. \nLoan Pricing Corp is a unit of Thomson Reuters.
