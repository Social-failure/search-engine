Dmitriev said in late November the central bank’s base scenario did not envisage restrictions on foreign investors’ ability to buy Russian state debt.\nThe central bank will consider several options at its next rate-setting meeting on Feb. 9, including holding the main interest rate unchanged or cutting it by either 25 or 50 basis points, Dmitriev said on Thursday.\nThe central bank last cut the key rate, by 50 basis points to 7.75 percent, in December and said further cuts were possible in the first half of 2018.
