Hammond talked of a rebound in sterling and turned to Mnuchin: “And we seem to be recovering quite a bit more, Steve, thanks very much.” Reporting by Alessandra Galloni and Soyoung Kim in DAVOS; Exditing by Mark Bendeich", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-25T13:08:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-25T13:23:02.007+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
