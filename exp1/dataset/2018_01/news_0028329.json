They have been among the worst performers since the start of 2018.\nOil prices gave up earlier losses, supported by a record drawdown of U.S. crude stockpiles at the Cushing, Oklahoma delivery hub. U.S. crude was up 0.08 percent at $64.02 per barrel.\nInvestors were also focused on the Republican efforts to pass a temporary extension in funding government operations and avert a shutdown, scheduling a vote on the measure in the afternoon.\nThe government is operating on its third temporary funding extension since the 2018 fiscal year began on Oct. 1.\nDeclining issues outnumbered advancers on the NYSE by 2,039 to 859. On the Nasdaq, 1,770 issues fell and 1,084 advanced.
