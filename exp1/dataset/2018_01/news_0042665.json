It has an ambitious target of 2 million NEV sales by 2020 and has signalled longer-term it will phase out the sale of conventional petrol-engine cars.\nHeizmann reiterated that the Volkswagen Group’s immediate target was to sell 400,000 NEVs by 2020, with an aim to boost the volume to 1.5 million by 2025.\nOver the next 7-8 years “we are planning about 40 new locally produced NEVs”, Heizmann said.
