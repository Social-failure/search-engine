That compares with a floor of 72.5 percent agreed by global regulators in December. \nGlobal regulators agreed in December that banks could use their own models to calculate how much risk is on their books. A 72.5 percent floor means that banks can only vary from a standard model by no more than 27.5 percent. Canada’s regulator is proposing banks can only deviate by 25 percent.
