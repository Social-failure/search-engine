After that, banks are required to transfer debts to lower-cost credit products.\nIn demanding clients’ agreement on overdraft transfers, banks are trying to avoid the consumer complaints they received after the credit card regulations were changed. Some clients complained of not being able to chose the new credit products to which their debts were transferred.\nBanks are discussing a rule in which they would be mandated to contact clients to offer them cheaper lines once they identify a customer is using a high percentage of his overdraft credit line for a long period.\nReuters reported last June that the central bank and private lenders were discussing changes in overdraft protection.\nAdditional reporting by Aluisio Alves; Writing by Tatiana Bautzer; Editing by Susan Thomas\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-01-18T05:28:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-18T01:05:34.004+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
