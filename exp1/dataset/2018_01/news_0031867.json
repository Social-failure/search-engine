In its statement, Jeddah Economic Co did not say whether that timetable was still on track. \nThe project, conceived when the Saudi economy was booming, now faces a more difficult environment, as the country's real estate market is slumping due to tough economic conditions caused by low oil prices. \nAlso, senior figures in two companies that are part of the consortium - investment firm Kingdom Holding and Saudi Binladin Group - have been detained since last November in Saudi Arabia's sweeping corruption probe. They are Kingdom chairman Prince Alwaleed bin Talal and Binladin chairman Bakr Bin Laden. \nThe award of the infrastructure contract suggests Saudi authorities are keen for the project to go ahead and do not want the probe to disrupt work. \nThe Jeddah Tower is projected to be over 1,000 metres (3,281 feet) tall, eclipsing Dubai's Burj Khalifa, which is over 828 metres.
