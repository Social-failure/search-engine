He says licenses will also be issued on New Year's Day.\nThe agency so far has issued more than 300 licenses statewide for marijuana distributors, retailers and cultivators.\nIn Sacramento, the state's capital, at least four shops have received licenses to being selling recreational, adult-use marijuana starting Monday morning.\n9:30 a.m.\nCalifornians may awake on New Year's Day to a stronger-than-normal whiff of marijuana as America's cannabis king lights up to celebrate the state's first legal retail pot sales.\nThe historic day Monday comes more than two decades after California paved the way for legal weed by passing the first medical marijuana law in the U.S., though other states were quicker to allow recreational use of the drug.\nBut finding legal pot may be a challenge in the first days of recreational sales in California. Only about six dozen businesses received state licenses to open on New Year's Day.
