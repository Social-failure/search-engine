REUTERS/Etienne Laurent/Pool \nAlthough Central America has seen a more than 90 percent drop in malaria cases since 2000, progress against the mosquito-borne disease has stalled and several countries in the region still have significant problems with malaria. \nAccording to the World Health Organization (WHO), more than 40,270 confirmed cases of malaria were reported in 2016 in Central America, the Dominican Republic and Haiti. \nGates said the collaboration would help cover “financial and technical gaps” in the region as well as strengthening health systems to tackle other diseases carried by mosquitoes, including Zika, dengue and Chikungunya. \nWorldwide, malaria infects around 216 million people a year, killing around half a million of them. Most deaths are among babies and young children in the poorest parts of Africa. The WHO says that in 2016, some $2.7 billion was invested in global malaria control and elimination efforts.
