The ruling Democratic Party has pointed to a sharp fall in arrivals from Libya since July as proof that it is now managing what before seemed like an endless flow of migrant boats.\nArrivals fell by a third last year to 119,000 compared with a year earlier, and they tumbled by two thirds in the second half of the year. The declines came after a deal with the Tripoli government sealed in February, which foresaw aid and training for the Libyans to fight people smuggling and to bolster their coastguard.\nMore than 20,000 are estimated to have died attempting the crossing to Italy in the past four years, the International Organization for Migration (IOM) estimates, making it the deadliest border for migrants in the world.\nThe Northern League, which is a member of the center-right coalition leading in polls ahead of the vote, on Monday vowed to stop the migrant “invasion”.\nReporting by Steve Scherer; Editing by Alison Williams\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-16T20:49:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-16T20:59:20.050+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
