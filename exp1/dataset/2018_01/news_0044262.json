Sobotka took a long pass from Schenn just before he entered the offensive zone, and used Ottawa defensemen Cody Ceci as a screen when he wristed a shot under the leg of goaltender Craig Anderson for his ninth goal of the season. It matches a career high for the left wing who returned after three years in the KHL.\nTarasenkoâ€™s 21st goal of the season doubled the lead six minutes into the third period. Anderson stopped a point shot but the rebound went all the way to the top of the circle on the other side of the rink, and Tarasenko -- who came off the bench and stepped into the shot -- unloaded a rocket that blazed too fast for the netminder to get across his crease and be in position.\nSchenn rounded out the scoring with an empty-net goal.\nThe Senators wasted a four-minute man-advantage early in the second period while down 1-0. They came within an inch as Derick Brassard rang a shot off the post, blowing a golden opportunity.\nAnderson made 38 saves for the Senators, who are now on a four-game losing skid.\n--Field Level Media\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-01-24T12:05:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-24T15:37:57.003+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
