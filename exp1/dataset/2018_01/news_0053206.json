The report shows that only 15.8 percent of transfers involved fees being paid from one club to another. Slideshow (2 Images) \nFees paid to agents also increased significantly. English clubs forked out a reported $125.7 million on intermediary payments and $447 million was handed over worldwide – up from $387 million in 2016. \nBrazil was the country most involved in international transfers with 1,755 of their players switching teams in 2017. \nTwo hundred and fifty four Brazilian clubs conducted international transfer deals with Germany (143), England (132), Argentina (111) and Spain (98) making up the top five. \nSpanish clubs received the most money in transfer fees ($840.4 million), but Portuguese ones posted the highest net receipts of $707.5 million.
