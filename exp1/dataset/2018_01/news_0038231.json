Victor Bailey Jr. also chipped in 18 points off the bench.\nKris Wilkes led the way for UCLA (13-7, 4-4) with 21 points, while Thomas Welsh posted a double-double with 17 points and 10 rebounds. Jaylen Hands gave the Bruins 12 points, five rebounds and four assists off the bench, but also turned it over six times.\nHoliday finished with 14 points on 3-of-10 shooting.\nUCLA, which lost for the third consecutive game, heads to Berkeley for a game against Cal on Thursday before facing Stanford in Palo Alto on Saturday.\n--Field Level Media\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-01-21T14:44:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-22T20:45:42.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
