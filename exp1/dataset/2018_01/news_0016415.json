The group has also approached Rio to buy its Australasian aluminum smelting unit, sources say.\nAlf Barrios, Rio Tinto’s chief executive for aluminum said: “The binding offer ... represents the best option for the development of the site while also delivering value for Rio Tinto as we continue to streamline our portfolio.”\nRio Tinto Chief Executive Jean-Sebastien Jacques, who took charge in July 2016, is moving to divest all but the company’s best-performing units.\nUnder the GFG Alliance, Gupta owns assets around the world that span steelmaking, aluminum smelting, engineering, renewable and non-renewable energy, commodities trading, shipping, property and finance.\nLast year, the privately-owned GFG Alliance struck a deal with UK-based tidalpower firm Atlantis Resources ( ARL.L ) to form a listed company, SIMEC Atlantis Energy, that marked Gupta’s first step onto the stock market.\nFurther such steps are expected this year, most likely the listing of a steel asset in the United States.\n($1 = 0.8328 euros)\nReporting by Maytaal Angel\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-01-10T20:24:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-10T15:56:29.003+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
