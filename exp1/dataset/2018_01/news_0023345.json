Rondae Hollis-Jefferson added 14, while DeMarre Carroll contributed 13 for Brooklyn.\nKent Bazemore added 16 and Dedmon contributed 11 before fouling out for Atlanta, which did not take its first lead until late in the third quarter.\nThe Nets held a 53-50 lead by halftime, opened the third with a 9-2 run and took a 63-52 lead on a Dinwiddie 3-pointer with 8:19 remaining.
