She was re-elected to the ANC’s national executive in December.\nDlamini’s spokeswoman said it was normal practice for the social development ministry to pay to get its message across and that the interview was not been timed to coincide with the ANC leadership conference.\nA spokesman for the SABC said the interview was filmed for an entertainment program and that 149,000 rand was not a large sum for such an interview.\nHe said the SABC had decided not to accept the cash from the government and recognized it had broken its editorial policies.\nAs president, Zuma appoints the board of the SABC. His presidency has been tarnished by a series of corruption scandals, including allegations that Zuma’s friends have influenced government appointments. Zuma denies any wrongdoing.\nAnton Harber, a professor of journalism at Wits University in Johannesburg, said the Dlamini interview had harmed the SABC’s journalistic credibility because the broadcaster had not disclosed that it was paid for.\nHarber joked on Twitter: ”Welcome to the SABC, Madam Minister. Are you an interviewee today, or a client?\nReporting by Alexander Winning; Editing by Richard Balmforth\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-01-20T03:03:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-20T02:56:17.017+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
