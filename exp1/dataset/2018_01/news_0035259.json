With approximately 7,000 employees worldwide, Waters operates directly in 31 countries, including 15 manufacturing facilities, with products available in more than 100 countries.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nThis press release contains financial measures, such as constant currency growth rate, adjusted operating income, adjusted net income, adjusted earnings per diluted share and free cash flow, among others, which are considered “non-GAAP” financial measures under applicable U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission rules and regulations. These non-GAAP financial measures should be considered supplemental to, and not a substitute for, financial information prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). The Company’s definition of these non-GAAP measures may differ from similarly titled measures used by others. The non-GAAP financial measures used in this press release adjust for specified items that can be highly variable or difficult to predict. The Company generally uses these non-GAAP financial measures to facilitate management’s financial and operational decision-making, including evaluation of Waters Corporation’s historical operating results, comparison to competitors’ operating results and determination of management incentive compensation. These non-GAAP financial measures reflect an additional way of viewing aspects of the Company’s operations that, when viewed with GAAP results and the reconciliations to corresponding GAAP financial measures, may provide a more complete understanding of factors and trends affecting Waters Corporation’s business. Because non-GAAP financial measures exclude the effect of items that will increase or decrease the Company’s reported results of operations, management strongly encourages investors to review the Company’s consolidated financial statements and publicly filed reports in their entirety. Reconciliations of the non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures are included in the tables accompanying this release.\nCautionary Statement\nThis release may contain “forward-looking” statements regarding future results and events. For this purpose, any statements that are not statements of historical fact may be deemed forward-looking statements. Without limiting the foregoing, the words, “feels”, “believes”, “anticipates”, “plans”, “expects”, “intends”, “suggests”, “appears”, “estimates”, “projects”, and similar expressions, whether in the negative or affirmative, are intended to identify forward-looking statements. The Company’s actual future results may differ significantly from the results discussed in the forward-looking statements within this release for a variety of reasons, including and without limitation, foreign exchange rate fluctuations potentially affecting translation of the Company’s future non-U.S. operating results; the impact on demand among the Company’s various market sectors from economic, sovereign and political uncertainties; the effect on the Company’s financial results from the United Kingdom voting to exit the European Union; fluctuations in expenditures by the Company’s customers, in particular large pharmaceutical companies; introduction of competing products by other companies and loss of market share; pressures on prices from competitors and/or customers; regulatory, economic and competitive obstacles to new product introductions; other changes in demand from the effect of mergers and acquisitions by the Company’s customers; increased regulatory burdens as the Company’s business evolves, especially with respect to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, among others; impact of the newly enacted tax reform in the United States; shifts in taxable income in jurisdictions with different effective tax rates; the outcome of tax examinations or changes in respective country legislation affecting the Company’s effective tax rate; the effect of the adoption of new accounting standards; the ability to access capital, maintain liquidity and service our debt in volatile market conditions, particularly in the U.S., as a large portion of the Company’s cash is held and operating cash flows are generated outside the U.S.; environmental and logistical obstacles affecting the distribution of products and risks associated with lawsuits and other legal actions, particularly involving claims for infringement of patents and other intellectual property rights. Such factors and others are discussed more fully in the sections entitled “Forward-Looking Statements” and “Risk Factors” of the Company’s annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2016 as filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, which “Forward-Looking Statements” and “Risk Factors” discussions are incorporated by reference in this release. The forward-looking statements included in this release represent the Company’s estimates or views as of the date of this release and should not be relied upon as representing the Company’s estimates or views as of any date subsequent to the date of this release.\nWaters Corporation and Subsidiaries Consolidated Statements of Operations (In thousands, except per share data) (Unaudited) Three Months Ended Twelve Months Ended December 31,\n2017\nDecember 31,\n2016\nDecember 31,\n2017\nDecember 31,\n2016\nNet sales $ 687,275 $ 628,787 $ 2,309,078 $ 2,167,423 Costs and operating expenses: Cost of sales 270,453 251,579 947,067 891,453 Selling and administrative expenses 148,795 130,238 544,703 513,031 Research and development expenses 35,122 32,753 132,593 125,187 Litigation provisions 1,096 3,524 11,114 3,524 Purchased intangibles amortization 1,639 2,358 6,743 9,889 Acquired in-process research and development - - 5,000 - Operating income 230,170 208,335 661,858 624,339 Interest expense, net (4,432 ) (5,756 ) (20,761 ) (24,225 ) Income from operations before income taxes 225,738 202,579 641,097 600,114 Provision for income taxes * 578,910 28,201 620,786 78,611 Net (loss) income $ (353,172 ) $ 174,378 $ 20,311 $ 521,503 Net (loss) income per basic common share $ (4.44 ) $ 2.17 $ 0.25 $ 6.46 Weighted-average number of basic common shares 79,454 80,366 79,793 80,786 Net (loss) income per diluted common share $ (4.44 ) $ 2.15 $ 0.25 $ 6.41 Weighted-average number of diluted common shares and equivalents 79,454 80,954 80,604 81,417 * The provision for income taxes for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2017 includes a $550 million estimate for the impact of the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (Tax Reform), which was signed into law on December 22, 2017. The $550 million income tax provision reduced net (loss) income per share by $6.89 and $6.82 for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2017, respectively. The $550 million income tax provision primarily consists of an estimated U.S. transition tax as well as estimated income tax provisions for state and withholding taxes and a charge associated with the remeasurement of the Company's deferred tax assets and liabilities from 35% to the new U.S. corporate income tax rate of 21%. The final impact of Tax Reform may differ from these estimates, due to, among other things, changes in interpretations, analysis and assumptions made by the Company, additional guidance that may be issued by the U.S. Department of the Treasury, and tax planning actions that the Company may undertake.\nIn the first quarter of 2017, the Company adopted Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-09 (ASU 2016-09) \"Compensation—Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting.\" Starting in the first quarter of 2017, the excess tax benefits or deficiencies related to stock-based compensation are reflected in the Consolidated Statements of Operations as a component of the provision for income taxes, whereas they were previously recognized in equity. ASU 2016-09 is required to be adopted on a prospective basis for the statement of operations and retroactive restatement is not permitted. For the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2017, the Company recognized an excess tax benefit, which decreased income tax expense by $6 million and $20 million, respectively, and added $0.07 and $0.24, respectively, to net (loss) income per diluted share. Additionally, the Company’s Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows will present excess tax benefits as an operating activity, with the prior periods presented adjusted accordingly.\nWaters Corporation and Subsidiaries Reconciliation of GAAP to Adjusted Non-GAAP Net Sales by Operating Segment, Products & Services, Geography and Markets Three Months Ended December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016 (In thousands) Constant Three Months Ended Percent Currency Currency December 31, 2017 December 31, 2016 Change Impact Growth Rate (a) NET SALES - OPERATING SEGMENT Waters $ 602,453 $ 554,226 9 % $ 17,785 5 % TA 84,822 74,561 14 % 2,709 10 % Total $ 687,275 $ 628,787 9 % $ 20,494 6 % NET SALES - PRODUCTS & SERVICES Instruments $ 379,114 $ 352,717 7 % $ 11,215 4 % Service 207,610 185,969 12 % 5,888 8 % Chemistry 100,551 90,101 12 % 3,391 8 % Total Recurring 308,161 276,070 12 % 9,279 8 % Total $ 687,275 $ 628,787 9 % $ 20,494 6 % NET SALES - GEOGRAPHY Asia $ 242,469 $ 225,648 7 % $ 3,289 6 % Americas 235,740 222,422 6 % 732 6 % Europe 209,066 180,717 16 % 16,473 7 % Total $ 687,275 $ 628,787 9 % $ 20,494 6 % NET SALES - MARKETS Pharmaceutical $ 373,245 $ 335,075 11 % $ 11,044 8 % Industrial 216,905 210,899 3 % 6,304 (0 %) Government & Academic 97,125 82,813 17 % 3,146 13 % Total $ 687,275 $ 628,787 9 % $ 20,494 6 % (a) The Company believes that referring to comparable constant currency growth rates is a useful way to evaluate the underlying performance of Waters Corporation's net sales.

The impact of tax reform legislation enacted in December 2017 was excluded in the Company's non-GAAP results as the Company believes this one-time tax charge is not indicative of the Company's normal or future income tax expense.\n(h) Certain income tax items were excluded as these non-cash expenses and benefits represent updates in management's assessment of ongoing examinations or other tax items that are not indicative of the Company’s normal or future income tax expense.\nWaters Corporation and Subsidiaries Preliminary Condensed Unclassified Consolidated Balance Sheets (In thousands and unaudited) December 31, 2017 December 31, 2016 Cash, cash equivalents and investments $ 3,393,701 $ 2,813,032 Accounts receivable 533,825 489,340 Inventories 270,294 262,682 Property, plant and equipment, net 349,278 337,118 Intangible assets, net 228,395 207,055 Goodwill 359,819 352,080 Other assets 204,170 200,752 Total assets $ 5,339,482 $ 4,662,059 Notes payable and debt $ 1,997,774 $ 1,827,263 Other liabilities 1,107,920 532,847 Total liabilities 3,105,694 2,360,110 Total equity 2,233,788 2,301,949 Total liabilities and equity $ 5,339,482 $ 4,662,059 Waters Corporation and Subsidiaries Preliminary Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows Three and Twelve Months Ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 (In thousands and unaudited) Three Months Ended Twelve Months Ended December 31, 2017 December 31, 2016 December 31, 2017 December 31, 2016 Cash flows from operating activities: Net (loss) income $ (353,172 ) $ 174,378 $ 20,311 $ 521,503 Adjustments to reconcile net income to net cash provided by operating activities: Stock-based compensation 9,368 8,394 39,436 40,998 Depreciation and amortization 27,753 24,085 106,002 96,449 Excess tax benefit related to stock-based compensation plans (a) - 930 - 13,844 Change in tax reform assets and liabilities (b) 550,000 - 550,000 - Change in operating assets and liabilities, net (41,765 ) (33,884 ) (18,109 ) (29,874 ) Net cash provided by operating activities 192,184 173,903 697,640 642,920 Cash flows from investing activities: Additions to property, plant, equipment and software capitalization (30,216 ) (22,671 ) (85,473 ) (94,967 ) Business acquisitions, net of cash acquired - 45 - (5,609 ) Investment in unaffiliated company - - (7,000 ) - Payments for intellectual property licenses - - (5,000 ) - Net change in investments (101,548 ) (26,618 ) (438,279 ) (391,342 ) Other cash flow from investing activities, net - - - 4,000 Net cash used in investing activities (131,764 ) (49,244 ) (535,752 ) (487,918 ) Cash flows from financing activities: Net change in debt 39,850 45,121 169,976 159,975 Payments of debt issuance costs (2,984 ) - (2,984 ) (1,705 ) Proceeds from stock plans 24,968 3,617 97,789 62,189 Purchases of treasury shares (86,802 ) (83,835 ) (332,544 ) (325,759 ) Other cash flow from financing activities, net 593 (876 ) 3,894 (10,401 ) Net cash used in financing activities (24,375 ) (35,973 ) (63,869 ) (115,701 ) Effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents 2,467 (13,264 ) 38,669 (21,335 ) Increase in cash and cash equivalents 38,512 75,422 136,688 17,966 Cash and cash equivalents at beginning of period 603,807 430,209 505,631 487,665 Cash and cash equivalents at end of period $ 642,319 $ 505,631 $ 642,319 $ 505,631 Reconciliation of GAAP Cash Flows from Operating Activities to Free Cash Flow (c) Net cash provided by operating activities - GAAP $ 192,184 $ 173,903 $ 697,640 $ 642,920 Adjustments: Additions to property, plant, equipment and software capitalization (30,216 ) (22,671 ) (85,473 ) (94,967 ) Majority facility renovations - (200 ) - 7,299 Free Cash Flow - Adjusted Non GAAP $ 161,968 $ 151,032 $ 612,167 $ 555,252 (a) In the first quarter of 2017, the Company adopted Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-09 (ASU 2016-09) \"Compensation—Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting.\" Starting in the first quarter of 2017, the excess tax benefits or deficiencies related to stock-based compensation are reflected as an operating activity, with the prior periods presented adjusted accordingly.\n(b) In the fourth quarter of 2017, the Company recorded a $550 million income tax provision for an estimate of the impact of the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (Tax Reform), which was signed into law on December 22, 2017. The $550 million income tax provision primarily consists of an estimated U.S. transition tax as well as estimated income tax provisions for state and withholding taxes and a charge associated with the remeasurement of the Company's deferred tax assets and liabilities from 35% to the new U.S. corporate income tax rate of 21%.\n(c) The Company defines free cash flow as net cash flow from operations accounted for under GAAP less capital expenditures and software capitalizations plus or minus any unusual and non recurring items.
