(\"Acuity\" or the \"Company\") (NYSE: AYI) and certain of its officers, on behalf of shareholders who purchased or otherwise acquired Acuity securities between June 29, 2016 and April 3, 2017, both dates inclusive (the \"Class Period\"). Such investors are encouraged to join this case by visiting the firm's site: http://www.bgandg.com/ayi .\nThis class action seeks to recover damages against Defendants for alleged violations of the federal securities laws under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.\nThe complaint alleges that throughout the Class Period, Defendants made materially false and/or misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that: (1) known trends were negatively impacting sales of Acuity's products; (2) Acuity's ability to achieve profitable sales growth was overstated; and (3) as a result, defendants' positive statements about Acuity's current and future business and financial prospects lacked a reasonable basis.\nOn October 5, 2016, Acuity announced financial and operating results for the Company's fourth quarter and fiscal year 2016 (ended August 31, 2016) that fell below expectations, citing \"uncertainty and volatility\" associated with the U.S. presidential election and the U.K.'s referendum vote to exit the European Union. On this news, Acuity's share price fell $12.01, or 4.7%, to close at $242.99 on October 5, 2016. On January 9, 2017, Acuity announced financial and operating results for the first quarter of the Company's fiscal year 2017 (ended November 30, 2016), advising investors of lower-than-expected sales, which the Company attributed to weaker customer demand \"apparently due to . . . election jitters.\" On this news, Acuity's share price fell $34.85, or 14.7%, to close at $202.51 on January 9, 2017. On April 4, 2017, Acuity reported financial and operating results for the second quarter of the Company's fiscal year 2017, continuing to blame \"the impact of continued softness in demand for certain short cycle, small lighting projects,\" but acknowledging for the first time that demand softness \"could potentially linger into the second half of 2017.\" On this news, Acuity's share price fell $30.13, or 14.8%, to close at $173.93 on April 4, 2017.\nA class action lawsuit has already been filed.
