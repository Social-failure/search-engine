Osservatore Romano/Handout via REUTERS They said it would make it difficult for pastors to deal with Catholic couples who want to get married in unusual secular locations instead of a church. Those couples would say “the pope did it, why can’t you?” one commentator wrote.\nBut the pope said the situation of the Chilean couple was a particular one because they had been already been married in a civil service eight years ago and were not able to marry in their parish church because it collapsed in a 2010 earthquake.\n“I questioned them (about marriage) and the responses were clear ... it was clear they had made a commitment for life,” the pope said, adding that the couple had even remembered subjects from the Catholic pre-marriage courses they had taken long ago.\n“Tell the pastors that they were prepared and I made a judgement call. The sacraments are for people. All the conditions were clear,” he said.\nReporting By Philip Pullella; Editing by Toby Chopra\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-22T17:07:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-22T17:35:05.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
