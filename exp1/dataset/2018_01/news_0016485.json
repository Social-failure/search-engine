REUTERS/Bobby Yip/File Photo \nAnt Financial’s planned $1.2 billion (888.76 million pounds) purchase of transfer firm MoneyGram International Inc ( MGI.O ) collapsed last week after a U.S. government panel rejected the deal over national security concerns. \nIt was the most high-profile Chinese deal to be torpedoed since Donald Trump was elected U.S. president a year ago on promises to put America first and protect U.S. jobs from foreign competitors. \n“We’ve noticed recently that protectionist voices have been rising in the U.S.,” Ministry of Commerce spokesman Gao Feng said in a briefing. \nChina was particularly worried about countries using national security concerns as a way to block foreign investment, he added. \nAnt Financial is owned by Chinese internet conglomerate Alibaba Group Holding Ltd ( BABA.N ). \nIn another blow to the global ambitions of Chinese firms, Huawei Technologies Co’s HWT.UL planned deal with U.S. carrier AT&T Inc ( T.N ) to sell its smartphones in the United States also fell apart because of security concerns, people with knowledge of the matter said on Wednesday.
