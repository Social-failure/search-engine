A quarterly dividend of $0.12 per share was declared for common shareholders.\nDividend\nThe Board of Directors declared a $0.12 per share quarterly dividend to be paid on February 23, 2018 to shareholders of record on February 16, 2018.\nNet Income and Results of Operations\n“In late 2016, Summit State Bank embarked on a strategy to increase our asset growth rate, adding to our quality staff to help execute our business plan to increase loan volume and earnings performance,” said Jim Brush, President and CEO. “As a result, we experienced positive results with increased loan and deposit volumes in 2017. However, there is a lag between the increase in new loans and realization of the earnings impact, as a result of various costs to implement our plan.” The following are some of the key accomplishments in 2017:\nLoan totals increased 23.2% for 2017.\nDeposit totals increased 38.8% for 2017.\nAdditional lending staff were hired to focus on SBA guaranteed lending and resulted in $351,000 in gains on sale of loans.\nNet income was $3,292,000 and $0.54 diluted earnings per share for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to net income of $4,967,000 and $0.82 diluted earnings per share for the year ended December 31, 2016.\nFor the quarter ended December 31, 2017, Summit State Bank had net income of $478,000 and diluted earnings per share of $0.08 compared to $1,188,000 of net income and $0.20 diluted earnings per share, for the same period in 2016.\nThe enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act on December 22, 2017 resulted in a write-down of the net deferred tax asset against 2017 earnings of $292,000. Our Board of Directors recognized the contribution of Summit’s employees and desired to share the future positive impact of the new tax law. As a result, each non-executive officer employee was awarded a special bonus, which totaled $144,000 and was expensed in 2017.\nThe Bank experienced a 10.6% increase in gross loans during the fourth quarter and a 23.2% increase for 2017. As a result, the Bank recorded a provision for loan loss of $350,000 for the fourth quarter and $520,000 for the year. This compares to no provision for loan loss recorded in either period in 2016.\nDue to the liability sensitive nature of the Bank’s balance sheet, the interest rate increases brought on by the Federal Reserve during 2017 proved challenging as net interest income declined by $101,000 during 2017 compared to 2016. The increase in loans outstanding were primarily recorded in the second half of the year and therefore did not fully offset the impact of the rising rates on the Bank’s interest-bearing liabilities. However, the increased loans in the second half of the year had positive results in the fourth quarter as interest income increased 14.9% to $5,712,000 and net interest income increased 8.8% to $5,080,000 compared to $4,972,000 and $4,670,000 for the fourth quarter of 2016.\n“The Bank should experience the positive impacts on earnings in 2018 from the increased loans generated in 2017 by having a full year of interest income related to the increase,” said Jim Brush. “We also believe increases in our payroll and other cost will become more measured as we accommodate future growth.”\n“Loan production is working on a healthy pipeline of potential new loans, both conventional commercial real estate and government guaranteed. This should be a key contributor to 2018 loan growth and income,” said Brandy Seppi, Chief Lending Officer and EVP.\nReturn on average assets was 0.62% for 2017, compared to 0.97% for 2016 and return on average common equity was 5.49% for 2017 compared to 8.37% for 2016.\nTotal assets were $610,864,000 at December 31, 2017 compared to $513,704,000 at December 31, 2016. Total assets were higher at December 31, 2017 with the receipt of a large deposit of approximately $55 million, which was partially withdrawn from the Bank after year end.\n“We continue to focus on quality balance sheet growth to target long-term increases in shareholder value. The ratio of loans to assets has increased during 2017 and loan quality remains stable,” said Jim Brush. “Core deposits have also increased to fund loans and maintain stability in a rising rate environment. The balance sheet is liability sensitive and our earnings will be challenged by increased cost of funds in the coming year.”\nAbout Summit State Bank\nSummit State Bank, a local community bank, has total assets of $611 million and total equity of $60 million at December 31, 2017.
