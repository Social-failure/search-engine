Net income for the quarter was $27.3 million, or $0.07 per diluted share, compared with net income of $107.5 million, or $0.28 per diluted share for the fourth quarter of 2016. Net income for the full year 2017 was $355.8 million or $0.95 per diluted share compared with net income of $342.5 million or $0.86 per diluted share for the full year 2016.\nThe tax reform enacted in the fourth quarter of 2017 resulted in a reduction of approximately $133 million in our net income for the fourth quarter and full year 2017 due to the remeasurement of our net deferred tax assets to reflect lower enacted corporate tax rates. The impact of this remeasurement was a reduction of $0.36 per diluted share in the fourth quarter and a reduction of $0.34 per diluted share for the full year 2017.\nAdjusted net operating income for the fourth quarter 2017 was $160.7 million, or $0.43 per diluted share, compared with $107.7 million, or $0.28 per diluted share for the fourth quarter of 2016. Adjusted net operating income for the full year ended December 31, 2017 was $517.7 million, or $1.36 per diluted share, compared with $396.3 million, or $0.99 per diluted share for full year 2016. We present the non-GAAP financial measure \"Adjusted net operating income\" to increase the comparability between periods of our financial results. See \"Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures\" below.\nFourth Quarter Summary\nNew Insurance Written of $12.8 billion was unchanged from the fourth quarter of 2016. Insurance in force of $194.9 billion at December 31, 2017 increased by 2.0% during the quarter and 7.1% year-to-date. Primary delinquent inventory (1) of 46,556 at December 31, 2017 increased from 41,235 at September 30, 2017, driven by new notice activity from areas affected by major 2017 hurricanes. Our primary delinquent inventory declined 7.4% year-to-date from 50,282 at December 31, 2016. As of December 31, 2017, the primary delinquent inventory includes 12,446 from the hurricane impacted areas compared to 7,162 as of December 31, 2016. The percentage of loans that were delinquent, excluding bulk loans, was 3.70% at December 31, 2017 compared to 4.05% at December 31, 2016, and 5.11% at December 31, 2015. Including bulk loans, the percentage of loans that were delinquent at December 31, 2017 was 4.55%, compared to 5.04% at December 31, 2016, and 6.31% at December 31, 2015. Persistency, or the percentage of insurance remaining in force from one year prior, was 80.1% at December 31, 2017 compared with 78.8% at September 30, 2017 and 76.9% at December 31, 2016. The loss ratio for the fourth quarter of 2017 was (13.1%) compared to 12.5% for the third quarter of 2017 and 20.3% for the fourth quarter of 2016. The loss ratios for these periods were each impacted by positive development on our primary loss reserves. The underwriting expense ratio (2) for the fourth quarter of 2017 was 15.9% compared to 15.7% for the third quarter of 2017 and 15.8% for the fourth quarter of 2016. Book value per common share increased by 0.7% during the quarter and 13.8% year-to-date to $8.51 (3) .\n(1) # of loans, (2) insurance operations, (3) based on shares outstanding\nPatrick Sinks, CEO of MTG and Mortgage Guaranty Insurance Corporation (\"MGIC\") said, \"I am pleased to report that in 2017 we achieved another year of strong financial results and continued to position our company for further success. Specifically, our insurance in force increased as we added $49 billion of high quality new insurance and persistency increased, the credit characteristics and performance of the new business written beginning in 2009 remain excellent, the legacy book continued to decline and contributed fewer delinquencies, and we maintained our traditionally low expense ratio.\" Sinks continued, \"In 2017 we retired our 2017 Senior Notes and converted the 2020 Convertible Senior Notes which improved our debt ratios, received ratings upgrades from Moody's and Standard and Poor's, and increased dividends to our holding company to $140 million from $64 million last year.\"\nSinks added, \"Reflecting the current trends in the origination market we expect to write slightly more new insurance in 2018 compared to 2017 and expect that our insurance in force will continue to grow. Further we anticipate that the number of new mortgage delinquency notices, claims paid and delinquency inventory will continue to decline. We will continue to focus on capital management activities and maintaining our industry leading expense ratio. We are well positioned to provide credit enhancement and low down payment solutions to lenders, GSEs and borrowers, now, and in the future.\"\nRevenues\nTotal revenues for the fourth quarter of 2017 were $271.5 million, compared to $266.5 million in the fourth quarter last year. Net premiums written for the quarter were $259.5 million, compared to $243.5 million for the same period last year. Net premiums earned were $237.4 million compared to $235.1 million for the same period last year as a result of an increase in insurance in force offset by a lower effective premium yield. Investment income for the fourth quarter was $31.3 million, compared to $28.1 million for the same period last year.\nLosses and expenses\nLosses incurred\nLosses incurred in the fourth quarter of 2017 were $(31.0) million, compared to $47.7 million in the fourth quarter of 2016. During the fourth quarter of 2017 there was a $103 million reduction in losses incurred due to positive development on our primary loss reserves for previously received delinquencies, due primarily to a lower estimated claim rate, compared to a reduction of $43 million in the fourth quarter of 2016. Losses incurred in the quarter associated with delinquent notices received in the quarter reflect a lower claim rate when compared to the same quarter last year, especially on loans in hurricane impacted areas as we do not expect a material increase in claims from these notices.\nUnderwriting and other expenses\nNet underwriting and other expenses were $43.8 million in the fourth quarter of 2017, compared to $40.6 million reported for the same period last year. Interest expense was $13.3 million in the fourth quarter of 2017, compared to $16.2 million reported for the same period last year. The decrease was a result of the retirement of the 5% Senior Notes and conversion of the 2% Convertible Senior Notes.\nProvision for income taxes\nThe effective income tax rate for the year ended 2017 increased to 54.7% from 33.5% for the year ended 2016 due to the remeasurement of our net deferred tax assets to reflect lower enacted corporate tax rates and the additional provision related to our expected IRS settlement. We expect our tax rate in 2018 to be marginally less than the 21% federal statutory rate.\nCapital\nAs of December 31, 2017 total shareholders' equity was $3.15 billion and outstanding principal on borrowings was $837 ", "external_links": ["http://mtg.mgic.com/", "https://mtg.mgic.com/", "http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/mgic-investment-corporation-reports-fourth-quarter-2017-results-300584378.html", "http://www.mgic.com/underwriting/index.html", "http://www.mgic.com/"], "published": "2018-01-18T14:45:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-18T17:10:41.011+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
