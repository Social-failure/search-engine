The attacker fled the scene afterwards. \nAn image on social media showed the body of what purported to be one of the victims, covered in blood from the waist down. \nThere was no immediate claim of responsibility for the attack. \nIslamic State claimed Friday’s attack on a Coptic church in Helwan, east of Giza on Cairo’s outskirts and on the opposite side of the Nile river. \nEgypt’s large Christian minority has increasingly been targeted in recent years by Islamist militants including Islamic State, which is waging an insurgency in the north of the remote Sinai Peninsula. \nSale and consumption of alcohol in Egypt is legal, and it is sold in specialist shops or licensed premises. Some Islamists say it should be banned because it is forbidden by Islam.
