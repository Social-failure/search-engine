Beattie said New York is considering a state tax credit for employees that would be equivalent to the payroll increase.\nStates are also looking at whether they can glean tax income from the new federal law’s international reforms, including a deemed repatriation of an estimated $2.6 trillion in U.S. corporate foreign profits held overseas, which is expected to generate $339 billion for federal coffers over the next decade.\nOfficials in some states are also trying to determine if they can tax some of the global income that corporations derive from intangible properties, including patents.\n“Politically, that may be the easier money to take, compared to taking money from people who are losing their itemized deductions or their personal exemptions,” Laura Wheeler, a senior fiscal researcher at Georgia State University, told the same tax forum.\nThe Republican tax overhaul limited deductions for state and local tax, or SALT, payments to $10,000 - less than half the sum that many had grown accustomed to deducting from their federal tax bills.\nThe diminished SALT deduction could make it harder for states to raise taxes in future years as they seek to balance budgets.\nThe new law may also hurt larger families by eliminating a personal deduction worth more than $4,000 for each member of households.\nBut corporations have seen their federal income tax rate slashed from 35 percent to 21 percent and will no longer have to pay federal income tax on active foreign profits.\n“Corporations are getting a pretty big nominal tax cut,” said Kim Rueben, an expert on state and local finances at the nonpartisan Urban Institute.\n“There might be room there to think about whether, on the state side, there’s room to change the responsibility on the individual versus the corporate liability for taxes,” she said.\nReporting by David Morgan; editing by Kevin Drawbaugh, G Crosse\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-01-25T05:55:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-25T12:55:34.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
