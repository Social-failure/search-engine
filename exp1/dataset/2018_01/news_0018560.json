It is a step toward fulfilling the group's Alliance 2022 strategy to improve cooperation and cost sharing between the three companies, and boost sales.\n\"We want to create a platform for a start-up to speak to the three companies, which was not always the case,\" Ghosn told reporters at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas on Tuesday.\nThe plan is to create a group that can enable the large corporate alliance to work nimbly and quickly with far smaller start-ups.\n\"We understand CVC's have sometimes a bad reputation among entrepreneurs\" partly due to a perception that they move and make decisions too slowly said Francois Dossa, the current president of Nissan Brazil, who will lead the fund.\nTo combat this perception, the group will be a separate legal entity, and will have its own processes for working with start-ups. The fund will have offices in many of the major tech hubs around the world, such as the Silicon Valley region, Paris, Tel Aviv, Tokyo/Yokohama, and Beijing, Dossa said.\nRenault and Nissan will each have 40 percent stakes in the fund, with Mitsubishi Motors funding the remaining 20 percent.\nThe alliance plans to launch 12 all-electric models over the next six years, and also plans to market vehicles with autonomous drive technology and develop robo-vehicle ride-hailing services.\nRenault-Nissan-Mitsubishi expects combined revenues to reach $240 billion, with annual unit sales of more than 14 million by the end of 2022. The alliance sold 10 million vehicles in 2017.", "external_links": ["https://www.alliance-2022.com/news/alliance-2022-announcement/"], "published": "2018-01-10T02:45:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-10T01:58:46.007+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
