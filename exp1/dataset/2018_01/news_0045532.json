[L8N1OX34J]\nThe party said it stood for the constitutional right of religious freedom, regardless of Wagner’s conversion.\n“Mr. Wagner could also choose another religion,” Daniel Friese, a spokesman of the party, told Berliner Zeitung, noting that Wagner had resigned from the board two weeks ago.\n“Mr. Wagner resigned on January 11 from the state board on his own volition. Only afterwards was it known that he had converted to Islam,” Friese told Reuters.\nWagner declined to comment on his conversion. “He does not want to speak with the press. He believes it is a private affair,” the party spokesman said.\nReporting by Riham Alkousaa; editing by Mark Heinrich\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-01-24T22:42:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-25T13:19:28.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
