Organizers said all people and horses involved were safe. \nThe Merseyside Fire and Rescue Service said initial investigations indicated that an accidental fire within one vehicle had caused others to ignite. \nFirefighters equipped with breathing equipment were still fighting the blaze six hours after they were called to the scene. \nLiverpool City Council opened a reception center for people who were unable to get home because of the blaze. \nThe city’s mayor, Joe Anderson, visited the scene, which he described on Twitter as a major incident. \n“The people of Liverpool never let us down with their generosity and everyone has now been accommodated or given a lift. A big thank you to everyone who called to offer help,” he said.
