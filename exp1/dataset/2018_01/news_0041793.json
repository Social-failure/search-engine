It is part of the bankâ€™s push to provide more capital markets products to corporate banking customers, to improve returns in the business.\nOllerenshaw will report to Jonathan Brown, head of lending and portfolio management for Europe and the Middle East.\nBarclays last week started cutting about 100 jobs in its investment bank, which affected many senior staff, including in debt capital markets.\nSources said at the time Ollerenshaw could move from DCM to another area. He has worked at Barclays for 10 years, including across equity and debt products, and was most recently head of corporate DCM and risk solutions group for Europe and the Middle East.
