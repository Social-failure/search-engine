Saudia Dairy and Foodstuff Co fell 1.6 percent after reporting a 14 percent decline in quarterly profit, as sales shrank slightly. \nIn Dubai, the index fell 0.5 percent as most property developers weakened, with DAMAC down 1.7 percent. \nUnion Properties, however, edged up 0.4 percent after saying it had sold its entire stake in district cooling firm Emicool to Dubai Investments, already the owner of the other 50 percent, for 500 million dirhams ($136 million). Dubai Investments edged down 0.4 percent. \nAbu Dhabi’s index rose 0.2 percent on the back of a 3 percent gain by ADNOC Distribution to 2.73 dirhams. On Thursday, Goldman Sachs initiated the stock with a “buy” rating and a 12-month price target of 3.31 dirhams. \nQatar’s index dropped 0.6 percent as Qatar National Bank, the biggest lender, fell 1.4 percent. QNB’s loan growth is expected to fall back to between 7 and 9 percent in 2018 from around 12 percent in 2017, analysts said at the end of last week after an investor relations conference call with executives of the bank. \nEgypt’s index fell 0.5 percent, but Orascom Development surged 3 percent after the board proposed a share split that would change the par value of the stock to 1 Egyptian pound from 5 pounds.
