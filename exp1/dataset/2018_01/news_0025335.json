We allowed them to cross the river and challenged them. All of the five who crossed the river were killed,” said an Indian officer, Major General Gulab Singh Rawat. \nA Pakistani military source, who declined to be identified, denied that any militants had been killed trying to cross from the Pakistani side to the Indian side. \nIndia accuses Pakistan of backing Islamist militants and encouraging them to launch attacks in Indian-controlled Kashmir, where a separatist insurgency has simmered for years, and in other parts of India. \nPakistan denies that and says India must hold negotiations on the future of Kashmir. \nThe neighbors have fought three wars since their independence from Britain, two of them over Kashmir. CALLING NUCLEAR BLUFF \nArtillery exchanges across the LoC were common for years before the 2003 ceasefire in Kashmir largely brought an end to violence but clashes have again been increasing over the past couple of years. \nRelations have been particularly tense since India said it had carried out cross-border surgical strikes against militants hiding in Pakistan in 2016. \nPakistan said Indian forces never crossed onto its territory. \nOn Friday, Indian army chief General Bipin Rawat said his forces were willing to carry out operations inside Pakistan despite the risk of a nuclear conflict, the Indian daily the Hindustan Times reported. \n“If we will have to really confront the Pakistanis, and a task is given to us, we are not going to say we cannot cross the border because they have nuclear weapons. We will have to call their nuclear bluff,” Rawat said at a press briefing. \nThe comment drew derision from Pakistan’s foreign minister who termed the statement “irresponsible” and an “invitation for nuclear encounter”. \n“If that is what they desire, they are welcome to test our resolve. The general’s doubt would swiftly be removed,” Khwaja Asif said on Twitter. \nPakistan’s military has said 52 civilians were killed and 254 wounded by Indian shelling in the region last year, more than in all of the previous 14 years combined. \nThe two sides accuse each other of repeated violations of the 2003 ceasefire.
