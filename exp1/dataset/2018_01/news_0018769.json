This brought its year-over-year increase to 1.8 percent.\nThe December core CPI reading was also stronger than the 0.2 percent rise forecast among analysts polled by Reuters.\nShortly after the latest CPI report, the 10-year inflation breakeven rate, or the yield gap between 10-year Treasury Inflation Protected Securities and regular 10-year Treasury notes, hit 2.05 percent, its highest level since March before subsiding to 2.03 percent, Tradeweb and Reuters data showed.\nOn Thursday, the 10-year breakeven rate ended at 2.02 percent.\n“The breakeven levels are pricing in a greater expectation of increased inflationary pressure. They have had a nice run since the middle of December and will need to see a continuation of inflationary pressures to sustain current levels,” said Sean Simko, senior portfolio manager at SEI in Oaks, Pennsylvania.\nFriday’s rise in breakeven rates was limited by a pullback in oil prices with U.S. crude futures retreating from $64.77 a barrel set on Thursday, which was the highest level since late 2014.\nReporting by Richard Leong\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-01-12T23:37:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-12T18:19:56.001+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
