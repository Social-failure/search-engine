Its analysis, though, involved only accounts linked to the Internet Research Agency, a suspected Russian propaganda service. \nCollins last month described Facebook’s initial Brexit-related search as inadequate, and said on Wednesday he welcomed the company’s latest response. \n“They are best placed to investigate activity on their platform,” he said in a statement. “I look forward to seeing the results of this investigation, and I‘m sure we will want to question Facebook about this when we know the outcome.” \nFacebook told U.S. lawmakers last year that it had found 3,000 ads bought by suspected Russian agents posing as Americans and seeking to spread divisive messages in the United States about race, immigration and other political topics. \nIn France last year, Facebook suspended 30,000 accounts in the days before the country’s presidential election to try to stop the spread of fake news, misinformation and spam.
