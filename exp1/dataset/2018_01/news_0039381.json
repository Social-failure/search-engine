It was the latest outbreak of gun violence in a nation where school shootings have become frequent. \nThe suspect, who police said was arrested without a struggle, was due to appear in court by Thursday. \nProsecutors intend to ask the court to charge the suspect as an adult, Jason Darnall, an assistant county attorney for Marshall County, told a news conference on Wednesday. \nThe youth will be charged with two counts of murder and multiple counts of assault, Darnall said. A grand jury will meet on Feb. 13 and will decide whether to proceed with the case, he said. \n“Until that point everything remains confidential,” Darnall said. \nThe slain students were identified by state police as Bailey Holt and Preston Cope, both 15, state police said.

Holt was a fan of the University of Louisville’s Cardinals football team. Cope played Little League baseball for the Calvert City Sluggers, in another small town more than 10 miles (16 km) north of Benton.

Hospital officials said four of those were in critical but stable condition. The fifth was in stable condition.
