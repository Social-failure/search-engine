REUTERS/Francois Lenoir Catalan separatists agreed on Wednesday to try to re-elect Puigdemont as regional leader, raising the scenario of the fugitive former leader governing by video link from Belgium. He faces arrest in Spain for sedition and rebellion.\n“Parliamentary rules are very clear,” said Spanish government spokesman Inigo Mendez de Vigo at a weekly press conference. “They do not contemplate the possibility of a (parliamentary) presence that is not in person.”\n“This aspiration is a fallacy, it’s totally unrealistic and it goes against the rule books and common sense,” he added.\nPuigdemont spearheaded a movement last year for the wealthy northeastern region of Catalonia to split from Spain, culminating in Madrid sacking his administration and imposing direct rule. He moved to Brussels shortly afterwards.\nReporting By Sonya Dowsett; Editing by Julien Toyer and Jon Boyle\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-12T17:29:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-12T17:55:50.011+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
