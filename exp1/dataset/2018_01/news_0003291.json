The company also said its internal review of accounting irregularities was progressing. \nBroker moves also drove trading: an upgrade to “buy” from Sydbank sent wind turbine maker Vestas Wind ( VWS.CO ) up 2.6 percent after the company secured several new orders. \nThe Danish bank said a flurry of new orders and less uncertainty in the U.S. market indicated activity in 2018 could be higher than expected. \nTo view a graphic on Europe's miners at 5-year high, click: reut.rs/2CaVart Reporting by Helen Reid,; Editing by Matthew Mpoke Bigg and Ed Osmond", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-02T10:40:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-02T11:10:05.019+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
