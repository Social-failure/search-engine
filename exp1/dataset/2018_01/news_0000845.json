The group claimed responsibility for the latest attack.\nDaniel Bundotich, the deputy county commissioner for Mandera South, said those killed included three police reservists, local civilians who usually assist the police and are assigned uniforms and arms.\n“The militants also set on fire a police lorry ... The police officers were on patrol along Elwak-Kutolo when they were ambushed,” he told Reuters.\nAl Shabaab has also launched other attacks in Kenya targeting civilians, in revenge for Kenya moving its troops into Somalia in late 2011.\nReporting by Humphrey Malalo and Abdi Sheikh; Writing by Duncan Miriri; Editing by Alison Williams\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-03T10:32:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-03T11:06:11.009+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
