AAP/NSW Police/via REUTERS Nicknamed “The Coathanger,” Sydney’s famous arch-span bridge opened in 1932 and, with 8 traffic lanes, 2 railway lines and a footpath and cycleway, is the main harbor crossing linking the city with its northern suburbs.\nWhile wallabies and kangaroos are found in both rural and leafy suburban areas, it is highly unusual to see them in the middle of a major city.\nA supplied video screenshot obtained January 16, 2018 of a wallaby on the Sydney Harbour Bridge in Sydney, Australia. AAP/NSW Police/via REUTERS “I‘m from the ‘bush’ (rural Australia), so I‘m used to see them running around all over the place but I’ve never seen one so close to the city before,” said a driver who gave his name as Ray, one of several people who called Sydney radio station 2GB.\nPolice said the wallaby probably began its city-bound journey at a golf club on the harbor’s north shore before it was spotted hopping south across the bridge in lane 8 at about 5 a.m. (1800 GMT Monday).\n“Traffic controllers ... monitored the wallaby as it hopped across to lane 1 and, without indicating, exited onto Cahill Expressway then to Macquarie Street,” police said in a statement.\nLarry Vogelnest, senior veterinarian at Taronga Zoo, said X-rays showed the wallaby had not suffered any serious injuries.\n“The swamp wallaby remains in a stable condition at Taronga Wildlife Hospital’s intensive care unit ... our hope is that the wallaby will be able to be released back into the wild,” he said in a statement.\nReporting by Tom Westbrook; Editing by Paul Tait\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-16T00:33:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-16T00:42:19.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
