M&C runs, franchises and operates 137 hotels around the world, including sites in London and New York. CDL already owns 65.2 percent of the business and Kwek is M&C’s chairman. \n“The board of CDL respects the decision of the offeree shareholders,” the Singaporean company said. \n“CDL remains committed to maintaining its controlling shareholding in the offeree, supporting the offeree’s strategy as a hotel owner and operator and the extensive capital expenditure program required to improve performance.” \n($1 = 0.7060 pounds)", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-26T18:26:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-26T18:47:23.008+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
