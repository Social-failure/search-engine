Under the new rules, Internet service providers (ISPs) will be able to create a fast lane and sell “paid prioritization,” a euphemism for normal delivery speeds for content providers who pay ISPs a fee. \nThe move has caused some states, like Montana , to sign executive orders preventing any ISP with state contracts to block websites or charge for faster speeds. \nDifferent regulations in different states is a nightmare scenario for big ISPs, which is part of the reason behind AT&T’s ad campaign. \n“Because the Internet is so critical to everyone, it’s understandably confusing and a bit concerning when you hear the rules have recently changed, yet again,” Stephenson wrote. “Legislation would… provide consistent rules of the road.” \nAT&T says it intends to work with Congress as well as consumer advocacy groups to push for the legislation.
