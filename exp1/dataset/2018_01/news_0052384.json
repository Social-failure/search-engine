The combined assets of the two would amount to around $12 billion. \nBTPN said in a statement to the Indonesia Stock Exchange that a “merger is in line with the direction of the Financial Services Authority (OJK) in order to consolidate the financial sector which is expected to improve efficiency and maximise the synergy of the financial sector in Indonesia.” \nIndonesian authorities are pushing for a consolidation among the nation’s 120 banks to boost the sector’s efficiency. \nDetails of a merger, including the value of any transaction, were yet to be decided, Anika Faisal, a director at BTPN, told reporters in Jakarta. \n“About the change in shareholders’ (portions), it is yet to be decided, but it is very possible that share ownership would be diluted,” Faisal said. \nThe SMFG spokesman said a merger would be complimentary given BTPN’s strength in retail business and SMFG’s strength in wholesale. The spokesman said nothing had been decided on raising SMFG’s stake in BTPN. \nAfter the announcement, shares of BTPN on Monday extended earlier gains to end the day up 25 percent. \nFaisal said that there was no plan to sell shares under a merger. \nBTPN had total consolidated assets of 91.37 trillion rupiah ($6.86 billion) by the end of September, while Bank Sumitomo Mitsui Indonesia had 68.58 trillion rupiah. \nBTPN would discuss the merger plan with Indonesia’s financial regulator (OJK), Faisal said. It would require due diligence and a shareholders’ meeting for approval, she said. \nA banking supervisory official at OJK said it had not yet received a request for a merger. $1 = 13,326 rupiah Reporting by Cindy Silviana in JAKARTA and Taiga Uranaka in TOKYO; Writing by Fransiska Nangoy; Editing by Ed Davies and Muralikumar Anantharaman", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-29T13:15:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-29T13:37:02.001+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
