Chandru and H. Suresh.\nTwo of the retired judges said it was important to support the group of Supreme Court judges because they had taken the bold step of speaking out publicly to protect the sanctity of the most important institution of India.\nFriday’s public outburst by judges prompted Prime Minister Narendra Modi to hold an emergency meeting with his law minister on Friday but the government has refused to comment.\nThe four former judges said in the statement that all rules and norms must be laid down clearly for allocation of cases.\n“This must be done immediately to restore public confidence in the judiciary and in the Supreme Court,” the former judges said.\nEditing by David Goodman\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-01-14T20:20:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-14T20:52:21.011+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
