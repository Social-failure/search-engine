Any permanent job cuts would be particularly sensitive ahead of a national election in March.\nItaly has said it aims to strike a deal before the election, and a person familiar with the matter has said the commissioners managing Alitalia were hoping to agree exclusive talks within the coming days.\nFILE PHOTO: An airplane of Alitalia approaches to land at Fiumicino international airport in Rome, Italy, May 3, 2017. REUTERS/Max Rossi/File Photo Lufthansa, British low-cost carrier easyJet ( EZJ.L ) and U.S. private equity fund Cerberus are among companies that have expressed an interest in Alitalia.\nA source close to the matter had told Reuters in November that Lufthansa had offered 250 million euros ($300 million) to take on most of Alitalia’s fleet of aircraft and half of its staff.\nLufthansa had offered to keep around 90 to 100 Alitalia planes, down from a fleet of 123. It is not interested in Alitalia’s ground handling services.\nAlitalia was once a symbol of Italy’s post-war economic boom but is now struggling to compete against low-cost carriers and high speed trains at home. It has not invested sufficiently in higher-margin long-haul routes to get back to profit.\nRome has ruled out renationalising Alitalia, but the fate of the airline remains politically sensitive and any tough restructuring to suit a foreign investor would rankle - especially if it involved thousands of job cuts.\nSpohr said in the letter to Calenda that he saw “considerable merit” in developing the opportunity to add Alitalia to Lufthansa’s stable of airlines but that the German group was not in position to play a leading role in the Italian company’s restructuring.\n“We therefore strongly recommend and indeed encourage the commissioners to start implementing key restructuring measures which would be common and beneficial to all prospective bidders,” he said.\nLufthansa surpassed Ryanair last year to retake the crown as Europe’s largest airline by passenger numbers.\nReporting by Ilona Wissenbach; Additional reporting by Agnieszka Flak; Writing by Maria Sheahan; Editing by Tom Sims and Keith Weir\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-11T20:50:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-11T16:02:52.010+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
