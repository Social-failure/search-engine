Congress is debating whether or not to write new legislation that would grant legal status to these immigrants that were brought to the U.S. as children and remain illegally.\nFormer President Barack Obama enacted DACA to keep the undocumented immigrants, known as dreamers, from being deported.\nThe immigration office said that deferments under DACA do not confer legal residency but gives prosecutors discretion on enforcing immigration laws.
