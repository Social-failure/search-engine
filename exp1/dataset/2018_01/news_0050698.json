TCF Financial Corporation (\"TCF\" or the \"Company\") (NYSE: TCF) today reported net income of $101.4 million for the fourth quarter of 2017, compared with $50.1 million for the fourth quarter of 2016 and $60.5 million for the third quarter of 2017. Diluted earnings per common share was 57 cents for the fourth quarter of 2017 (inclusive of 29 cents per share of items listed below), compared with 27 cents for the fourth quarter of 2016 and 29 cents for the third quarter of 2017 (inclusive of a one-time reduction in net income available to common stockholders of 4 cents per common share related to the redemption of the Series A non-cumulative perpetual preferred stock in the third quarter of 2017). Net income and diluted earnings per common share for the fourth quarter of 2017 were impacted by the following items:\nEstimated net tax benefit of $130.7 million, or 77 cents per common share, as a result of the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (\"Tax Reform\") on December 22, 2017, Pre-tax charge of $88.2 million, or 48 cents per common share, related to impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets, severance, other asset impairments and lease termination write-offs associated with the discontinuation of auto finance loan originations effective December 1, 2017 and Pre-tax impact of $13.1 million, or 5 cents per common share, related to additional TCF Foundation contribution, one-time team member bonuses, planned closure of five branches and inventory finance program extension.\n\"TCF generated positive momentum throughout 2017 that positions us well for continued success in 2018,\" said Craig R. Dahl, chairman and chief executive officer. \"During the year, we successfully improved core earnings trends, reduced our risk profile and executed on our key initiatives. Our success in these areas, combined with the benefits from the recent Tax Reform, enabled us to give back to our team members and communities, invest in our business and drive shareholder value.\n\"During the fourth quarter, we discontinued auto finance loan originations and began deploying capital into other areas that we believe will provide a better return for our shareholders. We expect this initiative to result in a meaningful earnings improvement in 2018. As part of this decision, we announced a new share repurchase program and began repurchasing shares in the fourth quarter.\n\"Enactment of Tax Reform in the fourth quarter not only will reduce TCF’s effective tax rate moving forward, but it also created a significant net tax benefit in the quarter. As a result, we were pleased to provide one-time bonuses to eligible team members and make a significant donation to the TCF Foundation that will increase the grants we provide to nonprofit organizations in the communities we serve. Our strong capital position and earnings outlook have also allowed us to announce a 100 percent increase to our quarterly common stock dividend and the redemption of our Series B non-cumulative perpetual preferred stock on March 1, 2018.\n\"These actions, along with the execution of our business strategy in 2017, put us in a position of strength as we enter 2018. With a continued focus on our four strategic pillars and enhanced capital and earnings positions, we are poised to deliver improved returns for our shareholders.\"\nRevenue\nTotal Revenue Table 2 Change (Dollars in thousands) 4Q 3Q 4Q 4Q17 vs 4Q17 vs YTD YTD 2017 2017 2016 3Q17 4Q16 2017 2016 Change Total interest income $ 270,628 $ 257,605 $ 231,658 5.1 % 16.8 % $ 1,019,057 $ 930,730 9.5 % Total interest expense 28,768 23,502 20,212 22.4 42.3 93,819 82,624 13.5 Net interest income 241,860 234,103 211,446 3.3 14.4 925,238 848,106 9.1 Non-interest income: Fees and service charges 33,267 34,605 35,132 (3.9 ) (5.3 ) 131,887 137,664 (4.2 ) Card revenue 14,251 14,177 13,689 0.5 4.1 55,732 54,882 1.5 ATM revenue 4,654 5,234 4,806 (11.1 ) (3.2 ) 19,624 20,445 (4.0 ) Subtotal 52,172 54,016 53,627 (3.4 ) (2.7 ) 207,243 212,991 (2.7 ) Gains on sales of auto loans, net 2,216 — 1,145 N.M. 93.5 5,460 34,832 (84.3 ) Gains on sales of consumer real estate loans, net 11,407 8,049 16,676 41.7 (31.6 ) 37,327 50,427 (26.0 ) Servicing fee income 9,000 9,966 11,404 (9.7 ) (21.1 ) 41,347 40,182 2.9 Subtotal 22,623 18,015 29,225 25.6 (22.6 ) 84,134 125,441 (32.9 ) Leasing and equipment finance 42,831 34,080 31,316 25.7 36.8 145,039 119,166 21.7 Other 3,218 2,930 1,365 9.8 135.8 11,646 8,883 31.1 Fees and other revenue 120,844 109,041 115,533 10.8 4.6 448,062 466,481 (3.9 ) Gains (losses) on securities, net 48 189 135 (74.6 ) (64.4 ) 237 (581 ) N.M.

Not Meaningful. (1) Annualized. Net Interest Income\nNet interest income for the fourth quarter of 2017 increased $30.4 million, or 14.4 percent, from the fourth quarter of 2016 primarily due to an increase in interest income on loans and leases, partially offset by an increase in total interest expense and a decrease in interest income on loans held for sale. Total interest income increased $39.0 million, or 16.8 percent, from the fourth quarter of 2016 primarily due to higher average balances and increased average yields on leasing and equipment finance loans and leases and increased average yields and higher average balances of commercial loans. The increase was also due to increased average yields on auto finance and consumer real estate loans and higher average balances of inventory finance loans. Total interest expense increased $8.6 million, or 42.3 percent, from the fourth quarter of 2016 primarily due to increased average rates and higher average balances of certificates of deposit, as well as higher average balances of long-term borrowings. Net interest income for the fourth quarter of 2017 increased $7.8 million, or 3.3 percent, from the third quarter of 2017 primarily due to an increase in interest income on loans and leases, partially offset by an increase in total interest expense. Total interest income increased $13.0 million, or 5.1 percent, from the third quarter of 2017 primarily due to higher average balances and increased average yields on leasing and equipment finance loans and leases, higher average balances of consumer real estate loans and increased average yields on commercial loans. Total interest expense increased $5.3 million, or 22.4 percent, from the third quarter of 2017 primarily due to increased average rates and higher average balances of certificates of deposit, higher average balances of long-term borrowings and increased average rates on savings accounts. Net interest margin was 4.57 percent for the fourth quarter of 2017, up 27 basis points from the fourth quarter of 2016 and down 4 basis points from the third quarter of 2017. The increase from the fourth quarter of 2016 was due to overall margin expansion on loans and leases, primarily impacted by interest rate increases, partially offset by higher average rates on higher average balances of certificates of deposit. The decrease from the third quarter of 2017 was primarily due to increased rates on higher average balances of certificates of deposits, as well as decreased average yields on inventory finance loans. These decreases were partially offset by higher average balances and increased average yields on leasing and equipment finance loans and leases.\nNon-interest Income\nTCF sold $126.1 million and $516.0 million of auto loans during the fourth quarters of 2017 and 2016, respectively, resulting in net gains in each respective period. TCF sold no auto loans during the third quarter of 2017. The decrease from the fourth quarter of 2016 was due to the strategic shift in auto finance. TCF sold $359.7 million, $520.8 million and $291.0 million of consumer real estate loans during the fourth quarters of 2017 and 2016 and the third quarter of 2017, respectively, resulting in net gains in each respective period. Servicing fee income was $9.0 million on $4.7 billion of average loans and leases serviced for others for the fourth quarter of 2017, compared with $11.4 million on $5.5 billion for the fourth quarter of 2016 and $10.0 million on $5.0 billion for the third quarter of 2017. The decreases from both periods were primarily due to run-off in the auto finance serviced for others portfolio. Leasing and equipment finance non-interest income for the fourth quarter of 2017 increased $11.5 million, or 36.8 percent, from the fourth quarter of 2016 and increased $8.8 million, or 25.7 percent, from the third quarter of 2017. The increase from the fourth quarter of 2016 was primarily due to an increase in operating lease revenue, mainly driven by the acquisition of Equipment Financing & Leasing Corporation (\"EFLC\") in the second quarter of 2017. The increase from the third quarter of 2017 was primarily due to an increase in operating lease revenue driven by increased originations in the fourth quarter of 2017, as well as an increase in sales-type lease revenue due to customer-driven events.\nLoans and Leases\nPeriod-End and Average Loans and Leases Table 3 Percent Change 4Q 3Q 4Q 4Q17 vs 4Q17 vs YTD YTD Percent (Dollars in thousands) 2017 2017 2016 3Q17 4Q16 2017 2016 Change Period-End: Consumer real estate: First mortgage lien $ 1,959,387 $ 1,953,199 $ 2,292,596 0.3 % (14.5 )% Junior lien 2,860,309 2,977,613 2,791,756 (3.9 ) 2.5 Total consumer real estate 4,819,696 4,930,812 5,084,352 (2.3 ) (5.2 ) Commercial 3,561,193 3,489,680 3,286,478 2.0 8.4 Leasing and equipment finance 4,761,661 4,730,931 4,336,310 0.6 9.8 Inventory finance 2,739,754 2,576,077 2,470,175 6.4 10.9 Auto finance 3,199,639 3,240,413 2,647,741 (1.3 ) 20.8 Other 22,517 20,439 18,771 10.2 20.0 Total $ 19,104,460 $ 18,988,352 $ 17,843,827 0.6 7.1 Average: Consumer real estate: First mortgage lien $ 1,959,067 $ 2,016,049 $ 2,306,421 (2.8 )% (15.1 )% $ 2,081,568 $ 2,424,013 (14.1 )% Junior lien 3,013,356 2,821,051 2,779,725 6.8 8.4 2,814,276 2,810,116 0.1 Total consumer real estate 4,972,423 4,837,100 5,086,146 2.8 (2.2 ) 4,895,844 5,234,129 (6.5 ) Commercial 3,536,725 3,473,425 3,147,517 1.8 12.4 3,433,276 3,126,881 9.8 Leasing and equipment finance 4,713,015 4,316,434 4,252,543 9.2 10.8 4,399,138 4,106,718 7.1 Inventory finance 2,688,387 2,479,416 2,389,980 8.4 12.5 2,646,500 2,414,684 9.6 Auto finance 3,267,855 3,280,612 2,647,088 (0.4 ) 23.5 3,105,326 2,693,041 15.3 Other 13,007 11,567 9,307 12.4 39.8 11,149 9,538 16.9 Total $ 19,191,412 $ 18,398,554 $ 17,532,581 4.3 9.5 $ 18,491,233 $ 17,584,991 5.2 Period-end loans and leases were $19.1 billion at December 31, 2017, an increase of $1.3 billion, or 7.1 percent, from December 31, 2016 and consistent with loans and leases at September 30, 2017. Average loans and leases were $19.2 billion for the fourth quarter of 2017, an increase of $1.7 billion, or 9.5 percent, from the fourth quarter of 2016 and an increase of $0.8 billion, or 4.3 percent, from the third quarter of 2017.\nThe increases from December 31, 2016 for period-end loans and leases and average loans and leases were primarily due to increases in the auto finance and leasing and equipment finance portfolios, as well as increases in the commercial and inventory finance portfolios, partially offset by a decrease in the consumer real estate portfolio. The increases in the auto finance portfolio were primarily due to the reclassification of loans from held for sale to held for investment during the second quarter of 2017, partially offset by the discontinuation of auto finance loan originations effective December 1, 2017. The increases in the leasing and equipment finance portfolio were primarily attributable to a loan and lease portfolio purchase of $445.5 million on September 29, 2017. The decreases in the consumer real estate portfolio were primarily due to decreases in the first mortgage lien portfolio due to run-off and the non-accrual loan sales in the first and third quarters of 2017 totaling $71.2 million.\nThe increase from the third quarter of 2017 for average loans and leases was primarily due to increases in the leasing and equipment finance, inventory finance and consumer real estate loan portfolios. The increase in the leasing and equipment finance portfolio is primarily due to the loan and lease portfolio purchase on September 29, 2017. The increase in the inventory finance portfolio is primarily due to seasonality and the expansion of the number of active dealers. The increase in the consumer real estate portfolio is primarily due to an increase in the junior lien portfolio attributable to the purchase of a loan portfolio of $175.4 million on September 27, 2017. Loan and lease originations were $3.9 billion for the fourth quarter of 2017, a decrease of $0.4 billion, or 8.7 percent, from the fourth quarter of 2016 and consistent with the third quarter of 2017. The decrease from the fourth quarter of 2016 was primarily due to decreased originations in auto finance and consumer real estate, partially offset by higher inventory finance and commercial originations.\nCredit Quality\nCredit Trends Table 4 Change 4Q 3Q 2Q 1Q 4Q 4Q17 vs 4Q17 vs (Dollars in thousands) 2017 2017 2017 2017 2016 3Q17 4Q16 Over 60-day delinquencies as a percentage of period-end loans and leases (1) 0.12 % 0.13 % 0.11 % 0.09 % 0.12 % (1 ) bps\n— bps Net charge-offs as a percentage of average loans and leases (2), (3), (4) 0.38 0.18 0.28 0.11 0.27 20 11 Non-accrual loans and leases and other real estate owned $ 136,807 $ 146,024 $ 158,000 $ 170,940 $ 228,242 (6.3\n)%\n(40.1\n)%\nProvision for credit losses 22,259 14,545 19,446 12,193 19,888 53.0 11.9 (1) Excludes non-accrual loans and leases.

The over 60-day delinquency rate, excluding non-accrual loans and leases, was 0.12 percent at December 31, 2017, consistent with the rate at December 31, 2016 and down 1 basis point from the September 30, 2017 rate. Delinquencies improved in the consumer real estate portfolio from December 31, 2016, however this improvement was offset by higher delinquencies in the auto finance and leasing and equipment finance portfolios. The decrease from September 30, 2017 was primarily due to improved delinquencies in the consumer real estate portfolio, partially offset by higher delinquencies in the auto finance portfolio. The net charge-off rate was 0.38 percent for the fourth quarter of 2017, up 11 basis points from the fourth quarter of 2016 and up 20 basis points from the third quarter of 2017. The increase from the fourth quarter of 2016 was primarily due to increased net charge-offs in the leasing and equipment finance and auto finance portfolios, partially offset by decreased net charge-offs in the consumer real estate portfolio. The increase from the third quarter of 2017 was primarily due to a $4.6 million recovery of previous charge-offs related to the consumer real estate non-accrual loans that were sold in the third quarter of 2017 and increased net charge-offs in the leasing and equipment finance and auto finance portfolios. Non-accrual loans and leases and other real estate owned were $136.8 million at December 31, 2017, a decrease of $91.4 million, or 40.1 percent, from December 31, 2016 and a decrease of $9.2 million, or 6.3 percent, from September 30, 2017. Non-accrual loans and leases were $118.6 million at December 31, 2017, a decrease of $62.9 million, or 34.6 percent, from December 31, 2016 and a decrease of $1.0 million, or 0.9 percent, from September 30, 2017. The decrease from December 31, 2016 was primarily due to the consumer real estate non-accrual loan sales in the first and third quarters of 2017, totaling $71.2 million, partially offset by an increase in non-accrual loans and leases in the leasing and equipment finance portfolio. The decrease from September 30, 2017 was primarily due to a decrease in non-accrual loans in the commercial portfolio, partially offset by an increase in non-accrual loans in the consumer real estate portfolio. Other real estate owned was $18.2 million at December 31, 2017, a decrease of $28.6 million, or 61.1 percent, from December 31, 2016 and a decrease of $8.2 million, or 31.0 percent, from September 30, 2017. The decrease from December 31, 2016 was primarily due to sales of consumer real estate properties outpacing additions and sales of commercial real estate properties. The decrease from September 30, 2017 was primarily due to sales of commercial real estate properties and sales of consumer real estate properties outpacing additions. Provision for credit losses was $22.3 million for the fourth quarter of 2017, an increase of $2.4 million, or 11.9 percent, from the fourth quarter of 2016 and an increase of $7.7 million, or 53.0 percent, from the third quarter of 2017. The increase from the fourth quarter of 2016 was primarily due to increased net charge-offs in the leasing and equipment finance portfolio. The increase from the third quarter of 2017 was primarily due to increased reserve requirements and increased net charge-offs in the consumer real estate portfolio mainly driven by the recovery of $4.6 million in the third quarter of 2017 on previous charge-offs related to the consumer real estate non-accrual loans that were sold.\nDeposits\nAverage Deposits Table 5 Change 4Q 3Q 4Q 4Q17 vs 4Q17 vs YTD YTD (Dollars in thousands) 2017 2017 2016 3Q17 4Q16 2017 2016 Change Checking $ 6,098,522 $ 6,046,372 $ 5,759,806 0.9 % 5.9 % $ 6,018,415 $ 5,688,690 5.8 % Savings 5,154,216 4,859,973 4,681,662 6.1 10.1 4,903,505 4,689,543 4.6 Money market 1,854,442 2,106,814 2,429,239 (12.0 ) (23.7 ) 2,140,553 2,488,977 (14.0 ) Certificates of deposit 5,032,085 4,636,007 4,198,190 8.5 19.9 4,495,062 4,229,247 6.3 Total average deposits $ 18,139,265 $ 17,649,166 $ 17,068,897 2.8 6.3 $ 17,557,535 $ 17,096,457 2.7 Average interest rate on deposits (1) 0.46 % 0.38 % 0.35 % 8 bps 11 bps 0.38 % 0.36 % 2 bps (1) Annualized.

The increases from both periods were primarily due to growth in average certificates of deposit, savings balances and checking balances, partially offset by a decrease in money market balances. The average interest rate on deposits for the fourth quarter of 2017 was 0.46 percent, up 11 basis points from the fourth quarter of 2016 and up 8 basis points from the third quarter of 2017. The increases from both periods were primarily due to increased average interest rates resulting from promotions for certificates of deposit and savings accounts. The increase from the fourth quarter of 2016 was partially offset by decreased average interest rates on money market balances.\nNon-interest Expense\nNon-interest Expense Table 6 Change 4Q 3Q 4Q 4Q17 vs 4Q17 vs YTD YTD (Dollars in thousands) 2017 2017 2016 3Q17 4Q16 2017 2016 Change Compensation and employee benefits $ 127,713 $ 115,127 $ 115,001 10.9 % 11.1 % $ 483,235 $ 474,722 1.8 % Occupancy and equipment 39,578 38,766 38,150 2.1 3.7 156,909 149,980 4.6 Other 158,936 61,408 59,235 158.8 168.3 345,456 231,420 49.3 Subtotal 326,227 215,301 212,386 51.5 53.6 985,600 856,122 15.1 Operating lease depreciation 16,497 15,696 10,906 5.1 51.3 55,901 40,359 38.5 Foreclosed real estate and repossessed assets, net 4,739 3,829 1,889 23.8 150.9 17,756 13,187 34.6 Other credit costs, net 343 209 178 64.1 92.7 677 219 N.M.

Non-interest expense for the fourth quarter of 2017 increased $122.4 million, or 54.3 percent, from the fourth quarter of 2016 and increased $112.8 million, or 48.0 percent, from the third quarter of 2017. The increases from both periods were primarily due to increases in other non-interest expense and compensation and employee benefits. The increase from the fourth quarter of 2016 was also due to increases in operating lease depreciation and foreclosed real estate and repossessed assets expense. Compensation and employee benefits expense increased $12.7 million, or 11.1 percent, from the fourth quarter of 2016 and increased $12.6 million, or 10.9 percent, from the third quarter of 2017. The increases from both periods were primarily due to higher incentive compensation and one-time employee bonuses, partially offset by reduced headcount in auto finance. Other non-interest expense increased $99.7 million, or 168.3 percent, from the fourth quarter of 2016 and increased $97.5 million, or 158.8 percent, from the third quarter of 2017. The increases from both periods were primarily due to charges related to the discontinuation of auto finance loan originations, including goodwill and other intangible assets impairment charges of $73.4 million and severance, asset impairment and lease termination write-offs expenses of $14.8 million, as well as the donation to TCF Foundation of $5.0 million. Operating lease depreciation increased $5.6 million, or 51.3 percent, from the fourth quarter of 2016 primarily due to an increase in leasing and equipment finance operating lease revenue related to the acquisition of EFLC. Net expenses related to foreclosed real estate and repossessed assets increased $2.9 million, or 150.9 percent, from the fourth quarter of 2016 primarily due to lower gains on sales of commercial properties and higher repossessed assets expense attributable to auto finance, partially offset by lower operating expenses primarily due to maintaining fewer consumer real estate properties.\nIncome Tax Expense (Benefit)\nThe Company’s income tax benefit for the fourth quarter of 2017 was $111.0 million, compared with income tax expense of $29.8 million for the fourth quarter of 2016 and $30.7 million for the third quarter of 2017. The income tax benefit for the fourth quarter of 2017 was impacted by an estimated net tax benefit of $130.7 million primarily resulting from the re-measurement of the Company's estimated net deferred tax liability as a result of the enactment of Tax Reform.\nCapital\nCapital Information Table 7 At Dec. 31, At Dec. 31, (Dollars in thousands, except per-share data) 2017 2016 Total equity $ 2,680,584 $ 2,444,645 Book value per common share 13.96 12.66 Tangible book value per common share (1) 12.92 11.33 Common equity to assets 10.42 % 10.09 % Tangible common equity to tangible assets (1) 9.72 9.13 Capital accumulation rate (2) 13.81 8.59 At Dec. 31, At Dec. 31, Regulatory Capital: 2017 (3) 2016 Common equity Tier 1 capital $ 2,242,410 $ 1,970,323 Tier 1 capital 2,522,178 2,248,221 Total capital 2,889,323 2,635,925 Regulatory Capital Ratios: Common equity Tier 1 capital ratio 10.79 % 10.24 % Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio 12.14 11.68 Total risk-based capital ratio 13.90 13.69 Tier 1 leverage ratio 11.12 10.73 (1) See \"Reconciliation of GAAP to Non-GAAP Financial Measures\" table.
