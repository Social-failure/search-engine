I want to thank everyone who broke their silence this year, and spoke up about abuse and harassment,” said Reese Witherspoon, star and co-producer of “Big Little Lies.”\n“To the people out there who are feeling silenced ... we see you, we hear you and we will tell your stories,” she added.\nKidman, who plays a victim of domestic violence in the show and Dern -- both of whom helped spearhead the Time’s Up campaign along with Witherspoon -- made pointed speeches as they accepted their awards.\n“This character that I play represents something that is the center of our conversation right now, abuse. I do believe and hope we can elicit change through the stories that we tell,” Kidman said.\nAmazon Studios’ freshman series “The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel,” about a housewife-turned-comedian in 1950s New York, was the surprise winner of best TV comedy and its star, newcomer Rachel Brosnahan, won best TV comedy actress.\n“There are so many women’s stories out there that need to be told,” Brosnahan said. “So as we enter this new year, please let’s continue to hold each other accountable and invest in and make and champion these stories.”\nReporting by Piya Sinha-Roy; Editing by Sandra Maler\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-01-08T12:38:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-08T14:11:02.065+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
