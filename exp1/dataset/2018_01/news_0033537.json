Backyard pigs were found with the disease in Romania this month. \nGerman farmers have called for 70 percent of the countryâ€™s large wild boar population to be culled to prevent the disease spreading to farm animals. \nBut German Agriculture Minister Christian Schmidt said he would not press for a change in trade rules. Germany could not by-pass European Union rules on the disease, Schmidt said separately at the trade fair.
