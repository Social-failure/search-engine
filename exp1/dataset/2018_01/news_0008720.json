John Kemp is a Reuters market analyst.

Net longs in Brent were up by 4 million barrels to a new record of 565 million.\nIn contrast, net long positions in WTI fell by 6 million barrels to 455 million barrels down from a record 461 million the previous week.\nIncreased bullishness towards middle distillates therefore accounted for all the increase in net long positions across the six major contracts in the petroleum complex.\nGrowing bullishness towards mid-distillates masked a more wary approach to crude and other refined fuels in the week to Jan. 2.\nBIG LONG Portfolio managers have solid fundamental reasons to think middle distillate prices and refining margins will increase further in 2018.\nDistillate consumption, which is closely linked to industrial activity and freight movements, is growing rapidly as a result of the synchronised global economic expansion and faster growth in world trade.\nAt the same time, refiners are struggling to make enough to meet demand. U.S. distillate stocks fell by 24 million barrels over the course of 2017, the largest annual drawdown for at least a decade.\nExceptionally cold weather across the major population centres of the central and eastern United States since the start of the year has boosted consumption of heating oil and threatens to draw down stocks even further.\nThe most intense cold is concentrated in parts of the northern and northeastern United States that rely most heavily on heating oil to warm homes and offices and as an auxiliary fuel for power stations.\nThe winter heating season has not yet reached the half-way point in the United States and already heating demand has been much higher than in the two previous years, though still slightly below the long-term average.\nEven before the recent burst of cold weather, U.S. stocks of distillate fuel oil had fallen below the 10-year seasonal average.\nDistillate stocks therefore start the new year in a depleted state and likely to tighten further if industrial activity and global freight movements continue to rise.\nBut the concentration of positions in U.S. heating oil and European gasoil has become a significant source of downside risk if they attempt to realise some of their profits.\nFunds hold 10 long positions in U.S. heating oil for every short one, the most lopsided positioning for more than seven years since November 2010.\nPositioning in gasoil looks even more stretched, with the ratio of long to short positions climbing over 16:1 and closing in on the record of 19:1 set in early October.\nRelated columns:\n“Distillate fuel oil market set to tighten in 2018”, Reuters, Nov. 17\n“U.S. gasoline and diesel markets look tight”, Reuters, Nov. 9\n“U.S. refiners struggle to keep up with demand for distillates”, Reuters, Oct. 5\nediting by David Evans\n ", "external_links": ["http://tmsnrt.rs/2D5Onkn", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-01-09T09:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-09T17:14:28.004+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
