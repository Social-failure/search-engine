Yancey claims the 94th district seat in Newport News, and the GOP will retain its majority by 51-49.\nA victory for Democratic challenger Shelly Simonds would have split the House 50-50.\nBut the drawing may not be the end of it. Yancey declined an offer from Simonds to make the drawing final, so Simonds said before the drawing that \"all options are on the table\" if she lost.\nSimonds may press for a recount or go to court.\nOn election night, Yancey appeared to have won the race by several votes. A recount last month put Simonds on top by one vote, but the victory was short-lived. The next day a three-judge panel ruled the race a tie, thanks to a ballot that marked circles next to both Simonds' and Yancey's names.\nMore from USA TODAY:\nPhilip Morris says its New Year's resolution is to give up cigarettes \nHere what's in the controversial new book about the Trump White House \nOregonians freaking out over law that requires some of them to pump their own gas \nThe ballot had been thrown out, but the judges determined it should be counted because Simonds' circle had a slash through it. The judges on Wednesday rejected a request from Simonds to reconsider their decision.\nHowever the race is decided, it may not determine the balance of power in the House. Democrats have raised a challenge in another district, won by the GOP candidate, in which some voters were provided an incorrect ballot. A court hearing on that race is set for Friday.\nThe Associated Press contributed to this article.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-04T18:43:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-04T19:45:48.024+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
