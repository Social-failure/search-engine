The ... pangolin scales were destined for Asia,” Bonaventure Adomo, head of Ivory Coast’s anti-smuggling unit, told reporters. Slideshow (2 Images) \nThe unit said two of the suspects came from Ivory Coast and one from Guinea, and that the ivory had come from as far afield as Gabon, Nigeria, Mozambique and Uganda. \nThe anti-trafficking group EAGLE, which worked with the authorities, said two of the suspects were from Vietnam and one from China. \nThe tusks were valued at $450,000 and the pangolin scales $350,000 on the black market, authorities said. \nThe pangolin, a small, armadillo-like mammal, lives in forests in Ivory Coast and elsewhere in West Africa. Global trade in them is banned under a U.N. convention, but their scales are prized in some Asian countries for use in traditional medicines.
