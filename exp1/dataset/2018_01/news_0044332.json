(NASDAQ:EQBK), (“Equity”, “we”, “us”, “our”), the Wichita-based holding company of Equity Bank, reported its unaudited results for the quarter and year ended December 31, 2017, including net income allocable to common stockholders for the year of $20.6 million, or $1.62 per diluted share, and $4.3 million, or $0.31 per diluted share, in the fourth quarter.\nBrad Elliott, Chairman and CEO of Equity, said, “Our velocity continued throughout 2017, and our footprint has been strengthened by the addition of strong community banks in Oklahoma, including Ponca City, Newkirk, and Tulsa, as well as additional Western Kansas locations. We have focused our sales and service teams on organic growth while integrating community banks within our network, and in 2017 our loans grew by 9.0% and core deposits grew by 9.6%, not including the addition of new markets. In 2018, we will continue our strategy of building strong commercial and consumer relationships within our communities, while offering sophisticated banking services. We continue to maintain an active merger pipeline, while serving customers in four states with our entrepreneurial spirit.”\nEquity completed its merger of Prairie State Bancshares, Inc. (“Prairie”) of Hoxie, Kansas, on March 10, 2017. The merger added three bank locations in Western Kansas. At merger, Prairie had assets of $153.1 million, net loans of $130.1 million and total deposits of $125.4 million. Results of operations of Prairie were included in Equity’s results of operations beginning March 11, 2017.\nEquity also expanded into Oklahoma during 2017, completing mergers on November 10 with Eastman National Bancshares, Inc. (“Eastman”) of Ponca City, Oklahoma, and Cache Holdings, Inc. (“Cache”) of Tulsa, Oklahoma. Equity now has five bank offices in Oklahoma, including bank locations in Newkirk, Ponca City, and Tulsa. Results of operations of Eastman and Cache are included in Equity’s 2017 results subsequent to each merger. At the time of merger, Eastman had assets of $259.7 million, net loans of $177.9 million and total deposits of $224.6 million. Cache had assets of $324.6 million, net loans of $287.2 million and total deposits of $278.7 million.\nNotable Items:\nIncome before taxes for the fourth quarter of 2017 was $7.5 million, or $0.50 per diluted share, compared to $981 thousand, or $0.08 per diluted share, for the same time period in 2016. Income before taxes, adjusted to exclude merger expense, was a record $10.7 million, or $0.72 per diluted share, for the fourth quarter of 2017, compared to $6.0 million, or $0.51 per diluted share, for the fourth quarter of 2016. Stated diluted earnings per share in the fourth quarter of 2017 were $0.31. Merger expenses, adjusted for estimated income tax, were $2.1 million in the fourth quarter of 2017, or $0.15 per diluted share. The impact on earnings in the fourth quarter for the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (Tax Reform) resulted in additional income tax expense of $1.2 million, or $0.09 per diluted share. Net income allocable to common stockholders, adjusted for these two items, was a record $7.6 million, or $0.55 per diluted share in the fourth quarter of 2017, compared to 2016 fourth quarter net income allocable to common stockholders, adjusted for merger expenses of $4.1 million, or $0.41 per diluted share.\nHighlights of Equity’s growth include:\nTotal loans held for investment of $2.10 billion at December 31, 2017, as compared to total loans held for investment of $1.38 billion at December 31, 2016. The increase of $719.7 million includes organic growth of $124.5 million, or 9.0%, $130.1 million of loans added in the Prairie merger, $177.9 million of loans added in the Eastman merger, and $287.2 million of loans added in the Cache merger. Total deposits were $2.38 billion at December 31, 2017, and $1.63 billion at December 31, 2016. Signature Deposits, or core deposits comprised of checking accounts, savings accounts, and money market accounts, were $1.61 billion at December 31, 2017, compared to $1.08 billion at December 31, 2016. Organic signature deposit growth was 9.6% for the year. In addition, the Prairie merger added total deposits of $125.4 million, including core deposits of $80.1 million, the Eastman merger added total deposits of $224.6 million, including core deposits of $197.6 million, and the Cache merger added total deposits of $278.7 million, including core deposits of $146.6 million. Total assets of $3.17 billion at December 31, 2017, compared to $2.19 billion at December 31, 2016. The Prairie merger added total assets of $153.1 million, the Eastman merger added total assets of $259.7 million, and the Cache merger added total assets of $324.6 million. Book value per common share of $25.62 at December 31, 2017 and $22.09 at December 31, 2016. Tangible book value per common share of $17.61 at December 31, 2017 and $16.64 at December 31, 2016.\nEquity announced two mergers on December 18, 2017. The first provides entry for Equity into Southwest Kansas, with a merger agreement with Kansas Bank Corporation (“KBC”) of Liberal, Kansas, parent company of First National Bank of Liberal/Hugoton. The second merger is a natural fit into Equity’s Kansas City metropolitan market, and Equity will merge with Adams Dairy Bancshares, Inc. (“Adams”) of Blue Springs, Missouri, parent company of Adams Dairy Bank. Equity expects to close and complete the mergers simultaneously in the second quarter of 2018.\nAfter the mergers, Equity will operate 48 bank locations in four states, adding five bank locations in Southwest Kansas and having a total of seven bank offices in its Kansas City market, including three in Lee’s Summit, Missouri, two in Overland Park, Kansas, and one in Kansas City, Missouri. The mergers mark Equity’s sixteenth and seventeenth integrations since 2003 and the mergers with KBC and Adams will be the sixth and seventh since the Company’s initial public offering in November 2015.\nFinancial Results For Year and Quarter Ended December 31, 2017\nNet income allocable to common stockholders was $20.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, as compared to $9.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, an increase of $11.3 million or 120.3%. Beginning November 11, 2016, financial results reflect the merger of Community First Bancshares, Inc. (“Community”). The merger of Community added five locations in Arkansas with total assets of $462.9 million. Results of operations of Prairie were included in Equity’s results of operations beginning March 11, 2017 and results of operations for both Eastman and Cache were included in Equity’s results of operations beginning November 11, 2017. Merger expenses of $5.4 million, $3.5 million after tax, are included in 2017 results. These costs were incurred mostly in connection with the Prairie, Eastman, and Cache mergers, with a very small amount attributable to the pending KBC and Adams mergers. Merger expenses associated with the Community merger and the then pending Prairie merger totaling $5.3 million, $3.9 million after tax, are included in 2016 results.\nDiluted earnings per share were $1.62 for the year ended December 31, 2017, as compared to $1.07 for the comparable period of 2016. Weighted average fully diluted shares were 12,707,184 and 8,755,526 for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016. The increase in weighted average fully diluted shares reflects the issuance of 479,465 shares in connection with Equity’s March 2017 merger of Prairie and issuance of 1,179,747 and 1,190,941 shares in connection with Equity’s November 2017 mergers of Eastman and Cache.\nNet interest income was $86.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to $52.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, a $33.4 million or 63.5% increase. The increase in net interest income was primarily driven by growth in loan and securities balances, partially offset by an increase in interest expense as we funded the increase in earning assets with increased deposits and borrowings.\nOur net interest margin was 3.83% for the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to 3.30% for the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase in net interest margin was primarily due to an increase in overall yield on interest-earning assets and the utilization of a “leverage” or “spread” opportunity during the first nine months of 2016. The spread opportunity, as more fully discussed in our 2016 Annual Report on Form 10-K, positively impacts net income but negatively impacts net interest margin due to investing in lower yielding interest-earning assets. Net interest margin excluding this spread opportunity was approximately 3.51% for the twelve months ended December 31, 2016. Equity suspended the utilization of this strategy effective October 1, 2016.\nThe provision for loan losses was $3.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to $2.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. Net charge-offs for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017 were $887 thousand compared to net charge-offs of $1.2 million for the comparable period of 2016.\nTotal non-interest income was $15.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to $10.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. Increases in service charges and fees and in debit card income are principally attributable to the addition of accounts and higher transaction volumes associated with the Community and Prairie mergers and to a lesser extent the November 2017 Eastman and Cache mergers. Non-interest income includes net gain from securities transactions of $271 thousand and $479 thousand for the twelve-month periods ended December 31, 2017 and 2016.\nTotal non-interest expense was $67.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to $47.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. These results reflect the full-year effect of the Community merger, the March 2017 addition of three locations in western Kansas, the November 2017 additions of five locations in northern Oklahoma, as well as additions to lending, customer service, corporate and operations staff indirectly attributable to mergers and other growth. Non-interest expense also includes merger expenses of $5.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. These costs were incurred mainly in connection with the Prairie, Eastman, and Cache mergers, with a small amount attributable to the pending KBC and Adams mergers. Merger expenses for the year ended December 31, 2016 were associated with the Community and then pending Prairie mergers and totaled $5.3 million.\nEquity’s effective tax rate for the twelve-month period ended December 31, 2017 was 33.4% as compared to 32.4% for the comparable period ended December 31, 2016. The effective tax rates for each of the comparable periods reflect the levels of tax-exempt interest income, non-taxable life insurance income, non-deductible facilitative merger expenses, and other non-deductible expenses included in income before income taxes as well as federal income tax credits available to reduce Equity’s tax expense for the respective periods. In addition, beginning with the first quarter 2017 adoption of ASU 2016-09, Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting, excess tax benefits, generated when the tax return deductible compensation expense exceeds cumulative compensation cost recognized for financial reporting purposes, have been recorded in the period in which they occur. Prior to adoption of ASU 2016-09, excess tax benefits associated with the exercise of stock options were recognized as additional paid in capital. The 2017 provision for income taxes also includes a fourth quarter charge of $1.2 million, or $0.10 per diluted share, related to Tax Reform. The reduction of the statutory federal tax rate from 35% to 21%, provided for by Tax Reform, resulted in the re-measurement of Equity’s net deferred tax assets.\nFourth Quarter Financial Results\nNet income allocable to common stockholders was $4.3 million for the three months ended December 31, 2017, as compared to $417 thousand for the three months ended December 31, 2016. Diluted earnings per share were $0.31 for the three-month period ended December 31, 2017, as compared to $0.04 for the comparable period of 2016. Weighted average fully diluted shares were 13,809,533 and 10,012,395 for the three-month periods ended December 31, 2017 and 2016.\nNet interest income for the quarter ended December 31, 2017 was $24.6 million as compared to $15.7 million for the quarter ended December 31, 2016. Growth in loan and securities balances, partially offset by the increased deposits and borrowings required to fund that growth resulted in the increased net interest income.\nOur net interest margin was 3.79% for the quarter ended December 31, 2017 and 3.60% for the comparable quarter of the prior year.\nThe provision for loan losses was $503 thousand for the quarter ended December 31, 2017 as compared to $760 thousand for the quarter ended December 31, 2016. Net recoveries for the three months ended December 31, 2017 were $26 thousand compared to net charge-offs of $405 thousand for the comparable period of 2016.\nTotal non-interest income for the quarter ended December 31, 2017 was $4.1 million, compared to $2.8 million for the quarter ended December 31, 2016. Increases in service charges and fees and in debit card income are principally attributable to the addition of accounts and higher transaction volumes associated with the Community and Prairie mergers and to a lesser extent the November 2017 Eastman and Cache mergers.\nTotal non-interest expense for the quarter ended December 31, 2017 was $20.7 million, compared to $16.7 million for the quarter ended December 31, 2016. Non-interest expense includes merger expenses of $3.3 million for the three-months ended December 31, 2017, compared to $5.1 million for the comparable period of 2016. Increased non-interest expense reflects the effect of merger activity, as well as additions to lending, customer service, corporate and operations staff.\nEquity’s provision for income taxes was $3.2 million for the quarter ended December 31, 2017, as compared to provision for income taxes of $564 thousand for the quarter ended December 31, 2016.\nLoans, Deposits, And Total Assets\nLoans held for investment were $2.10 billion at December 31, 2017, compared to $1.38 billion at December 31, 2016, an increase of $719.7 million. The year-over-year increase in loans held for investment includes organic growth of $124.5 million, or 9.0%, $130.1 million of net loans acquired in the Prairie merger in the first quarter of 2017, $177.9 million of net loans acquired in the Eastman merger in the fourth quarter of 2017 and $287.2 million of net loans acquired in the Cache merger in the fourth quarter of 2017.\nAs of December 31, 2017, Equity’s allowance for loan losses to total loans was 0.40%, compared to 0.46% at December 31, 2016. Total reserves, including purchase discounts, to total loans were approximately 1.21% as of December 31, 2017, compared to 1.37% at December 31, 2016. Nonperforming assets of $48.2 million as of December 31, 2017 were 1.52% to total assets, and include $7.8 million of nonperforming assets acquired in the Prairie merger, $8.4 million of nonperforming assets acquired in the Eastman merger, and $520 thousand of nonperforming assets acquired in the Cache merger. Nonperforming assets at December 31, 2016 were $31.3 million or 1.43% of total assets.\nTotal deposits were $2.38 billion at December 31, 2017, as compared to $1.63 billion at December 31, 2016. Total deposits increased $751.6 million between December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2017, including $125.4 million of deposits assumed in the Prairie merger, $224.6 million of deposits assumed in the Eastman merger, $278.7 million of deposits assumed in the Cache merger, and $122.9 million, or 7.5%, of organic deposit growth. Signature Deposits were $1.61 billion at December 31, 2017, as compared to $1.08 billion at December 31, 2016.\nAt December 31, 2017, Equity had consolidated total assets of $3.17 billion, compared to $2.19 billion at December 31, 2016, an increase of $978.8 million. The increase in total assets includes $153.1 million of total assets acquired in the Prairie merger, $259.7 million of total assets acquired in the Eastman merger, and $324.6 million of total assets acquired in the Cache merger.\nCapital and Borrowings\nIn connection with the Prairie merger, Equity issued 479,465 shares valued at $31.79 per share, Equity’s closing price on March 10, 2017.

These forward-looking statements reflect the current views of Equity’s management with respect to, among other things, future events and Equity’s financial performance. These statements are often, but not always, made through the use of words or phrases such as “may,” “should,” “could,” “predict,” “potential,” “believe,” “will likely result,” “expect,” “continue,” “will,” “anticipate,” “seek,” “estimate,” “intend,” “plan,” “project,” “forecast,” “goal,” “target,” “would” and “outlook,” or the negative variations of those words or other comparable words of a future or forward-looking nature. These forward-looking statements are not historical facts, and are based on current expectations, estimates and projections about Equity’s industry, management’s beliefs and certain assumptions made by management, many of which, by their nature, are inherently uncertain and beyond Equity’s control. Accordingly, Equity cautions you that any such forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and are subject to risks, assumptions and uncertainties that are difficult to predict. Although Equity believes that the expectations reflected in these forward-looking statements are reasonable as of the date made, actual results may prove to be materially different from the results expressed or implied by the forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from Equity’s expectations include competition from other financial institutions and bank holding companies; the effects of and changes in trade, monetary and fiscal policies and laws, including interest rate policies of the Federal Reserve Board; changes in the demand for loans; fluctuations in value of collateral and loan reserves; inflation, interest rate, market and monetary fluctuations; changes in consumer spending, borrowing and savings habits; and acquisitions and integration of acquired businesses, and similar variables. The foregoing list of factors is not exhaustive.\nFor discussion of these and other risks that may cause actual results to differ from expectations, please refer to “Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements” and “Risk Factors” in Equity’s Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) on March 16, 2017 and any updates to those risk factors set forth in Equity’s subsequent Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q or Current Reports on Form 8-K, Form S-3 or Form S-4.

Accordingly, you should not place undue reliance on any such forward-looking statements. Any forward-looking statement speaks only as of the date on which it is made, and Equity does not undertake any obligation to publicly update or review any forward-looking statement, whether as a result of new information, future developments or otherwise.
