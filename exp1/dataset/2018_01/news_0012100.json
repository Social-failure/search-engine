The logo of Continental AG, a German automotive manufacturing company specialized in tyres, brakes and car safety products is pictured on a rim at the company's stand during the Hannover Fair in Hanover, Germany, April 25, 2016. REUTERS/Wolfgang Rattay \nA possible separation of Continentalâ€™s business related to combustion engines also remains on the agenda as the auto industry shifts its focus towards electric vehicles, the person said. \nInvestment banks have presented various ideas over the last couple of months, but no specific blueprint has emerged so far, the person said. \nContinental is investing in electric drives and strengthening its expertise in automotive electronics as customers such as Volkswagen ( VOWG_p.DE ), Daimler ( DAIGn.DE ) and Ford ( F.N ) sharpen their focus on electric and self-driving technologies. \nThe Hanover-based group said a year ago it was reviewing its strategy for its Powertrain division after earnings at the business, whose products include transmission control units and fuel pumps, failed to meet expectations. \nBut it has also pledged to keep developing new products and systems for combustion-based power trains until at least 2025 when it expects demand for electric vehicles to start taking off on the back of continuing reductions in battery prices. \nBloomberg earlier reported Continental was in exploratory talks with advisers on a major overhaul or even a breakup of its business, citing people familiar with the matter. \nIt said Continental could create a holding company for its divisions and then list shares of the more profitable units, such as the tyre business, or combine some operations with rivals. \nThe review remains at an early stage, with no decision made yet, it cited the sources as saying. \nContinental, which is due to publish preliminary financial results later on Tuesday, declined to comment. \nShares in the group, which is 46 percent-controlled by the family that owns ball bearings maker Schaeffler ( SHA_p.DE ), jumped as much as 7.9 percent to a record high of 257.40 euros following the report. \nThey were up 5.3 percent at 251.20 euros by 1442 GMT. \nRivals such as Delphi and Autoliv ( ALV.N ) have spun off divisions to simplify their corporate structures and react to the changes in technology. \nCarmaker Daimler ( DAIGn.DE ) has said it may split parts of its business into separate legal entities, which may allow for a partial listing to raise funds to invest in new services such as autonomous and electric cars.
