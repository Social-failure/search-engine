The decision by the pro-government legislative superbody on Tuesday to hold presidential elections by April 30 upset the talks, opposition leader Luis Florido told Reuters.\n“It didn’t end, but it’s in intensive therapy,” Florido said of the negotiations.\nReporting by Jorge Pineda in Santo Domingo, Julia Love in Mexico City and Andreina Aponte in Caracas; Editing by Phil Berlowitz\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-26T00:15:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-26T00:32:07.008+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
