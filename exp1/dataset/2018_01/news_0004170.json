He downplayed Intel's assertion that the security issue will not have a big impact on its business as \"optimistic.\"\nThe analyst noted in some special instances the impeding security patches for Intel chips could cause a decrease in performance of 20 to 30 percent.\n\"While INTC does not see a financial or market share impact from the security issue and performance degradation with the vulnerability, we believe its high performance customers might have a different take,\" he wrote. This is \"a leg up for AMD and Nvidia. A difference in architecture implies less vulnerability as noted by AMD 'with near zero risk' and we believe [the same] for NVDA.\"\nRakesh maintained his buy ratings on AMD, Nvidia and Intel.\nDisclaimer", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-04T16:16:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-04T16:18:35.010+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
