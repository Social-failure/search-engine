BDI plans to release the study on Thursday. \nThe study identified some options for achieving the climate targets, including expanding EU carbon dioxide pricing already in place for the energy and industrial sectors. \nIt also called for increased support for CO2-neutral fuels through the use of alternative energy sources such as methane, and said it was imperative to develop underground systems to capture and store carbon. \nGermany’s would-be coalition partners agreed last week to drop plans to lower CO2 emissions by 40 percent from 1990 levels by 2020, although they intend to keep a 55 percent target for 2030, sources familiar with the negotiations said. \n($1 = 0.8176 euros)", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-17T22:27:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-17T22:56:05.006+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
