As those shares have no name attached, ownership can be concealed and even transferred with no documentation. \nThere are no estimates for how much tax income is lost this way. A global crack down on illegal tax avoidance has allowed tax authorities around the world to recover more than $85 billion over the last eight years, the OECD estimates. \nThe Swiss proposal would only apply to non publicly listed companies and not groups such as pharmaceutical company Roche or lift-maker Schindler that have historically used voting bearer shares to keep companies under the control of their founding families. \nThe proposed rules would carry financial penalties for companies that do not comply. \nIn 2015, Britain banned companies from issuing bearer shares and ordered companies that already had them to convert them into securities whose ownership can be documented. Singapore, Hong Kong, Belgium, Austria and the United States have also passed laws restricting bearer shares in recent years. \nAn earlier Swiss attempt to tighten rules on bearer shares was judged inadequate by the OECD’s Global Forum on Transparency and Exchange of Information for Tax Purposes. \n“If Switzerland does not follow the recommendation, it can expect to be labelled ‘non-conforming’ in this area,” according to a government report issued on Wednesday. \n“That means Switzerland could achieve only a total rating of ‘partial compliance’ during the next review of whether it meets international standards of financial transparency.” \nIn recent years, Switzerland says bearer shares have dwindled as companies voluntarily convert them into registered shares. Bearer shares now represent only 12 percent of the share capital of companies, down from 27 percent in 2014.
