China’s ministry of public security did not immediately respond to a request for comment. \nOn Thursday, Yu released another open letter calling for changes to China’s state constitution to make elections fairer, reduce military power and delete a preamble that gives the Communist Party primacy in national leadership. \nYu had been involved in a number of high-profile and politically sensitive cases, including defending fellow veteran human rights lawyer Wang Yu, following her detention in the summer of 2016. \nYu was detained briefly in October 2017 during a meeting of China’s top leadership after he wrote a letter in which he said Xi was unsuited to rule China and calling for his replacement. \nMost recently, Yu had been attempting to defend another detained rights lawyer, Wang Quanzhang, but the authorities have barred him from meeting Wang. \nWang was detained 920 days ago and his case has yet to come to trial. Neither his wife or any of the lawyers that she has asked to defend Wang, including Yu, have been able to meet with him since.
