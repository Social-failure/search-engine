But the group retains a strong presence in the south and center and can still carry out major attacks. It was blamed for twin bomb blasts in Mogadishu in October that killed more than 500 people.\nThe militants aim to topple Somalia’s government, to drive out African Union peacekeeping troops and to impose the group’s own strict interpretation of Islamic law.\nWriting by Aaron Maasho; Editing by Gareth Jones\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-03T13:32:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-03T13:45:15.010+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
