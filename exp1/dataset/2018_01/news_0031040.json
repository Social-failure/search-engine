The charge encompasses several elements, including a tax on accumulated overseas profits and the revaluation of deferred tax assets and liabilities. As a result, IBM's reported GAAP tax rate, which includes the one-time charge, was 124 percent for the fourth quarter, and 49 percent for the full year. IBM's operating (non-GAAP) tax rate, which excludes the one-time charge, was 6 percent for the fourth quarter; and 7 percent for the full year, which includes the effect of discrete tax benefits in the first and second quarters. Without discrete tax items, the full-year operating (non-GAAP) tax rate was 12 percent, at the low end of the company's previously estimated range.\nFull-Year Results\nFull-year GAAP EPS from continuing operations of $6.14\n-- Includes a one-time charge of $5.5 billion associated with the enactment of U.S. tax reform Full-year operating (non-GAAP) EPS of $13.80\n-- Excludes the one-time charge of $5.5 billion associated with the enactment of U.S. tax reform Full-year revenue of $79.1 billion, down 1 percent\nFULL YEAR 2017 Gross Profit Diluted EPS Net Income Margin GAAP from Continuing Operations $6.14 * $5.8B * 45.8% Year/Year -50% * -52% * -2.1Pts Operating (Non-GAAP) $13.80 $12.9B 47.4% Year/Year 2% -1% -1.6Pts As-a-service Strategic annual exit REVENUE Total IBM Imperatives Cloud run rate As reported (US$) $79.1B $36.5B $17.0B $10.3B Year/Year -1% 11% 24% 20% Year/Year adjusting for currency -1% 11% 24% 18% * Includes a one-time charge of $5.5 billion associated with the enactment of U.S. tax reform.
