Chief Executive Jim Foote is addressing investors following release of CSX’s fourth-quarter earnings for the first time since being made permanent CEO , the WSJ’s Paul Ziobro reports. The abrupt leadership shift in the wake of Mr. Harrison’s death last month capped a tumultuous year at CSX that included a proxy fight that installed Mr. Harrison as CEO, as well as layoffs, management departures and a new operating plan that led to widespread disruptions at the railroad for weeks. Questions about the lean operating plan Mr. Harrison was implementing are still hanging over CSX. Investors, shipping customers and competitors are looking for whether Mr. Foote will restore some services or whether a new leadership team will shutter even more track to reshape the railroad into a far leaner but more efficient operator.\nThe U.S. Supreme Court may take a big role in the direction of online commerce. The court will consider whether states can broadly require online retailers to collect sales taxes even if they lack a physical presence in the state. The WSJ’s Brent Kendall and Richard Rubin write the justices will hear an appeal by the state of South Dakota, which has been seeking to overturn a high-court precedent built from rulings involving mail-order businesses that limits states’ sales tax collections. It’s a challenge to a system of tax and economic regulation that hasn’t kept up with the online explosion that has put far-flung retailers and virtual businesses in competition with local store owners. Many retailers say the playing field is heavily tilted against them, with online companies undercutting prices and effectively gaining a subsidy by offering tax-free sales. Many states also are being hurt as revenues from sales taxes erode.\nAmazon.com Inc. is getting bigger online sales out of its splashy acquisition of a brick-and-mortar retailer. Sales trackers say business at Amazon’s online grocery-delivery service AmazonFresh jumped 35% in the last four months of 2017 from the previous four-month period, boosted by sales of brands from Whole Foods. The WSJ’s Heather Haddon writes the sales of $135 million in the period still pale next to the business of big grocery chains like Kroger Co. , but the growth from Whole Foods’ products should help Amazon build out its grocery delivery service in an increasingly competitive market. Online grocery sales account for less than 3% of the roughly $800 billion grocery market. Analysts expect that share will grow into the double digits in the next five years, however. Amazon sold nearly $2 billion in groceries in the U.S. last year, says One Click, which analyzes patterns in e-commerce transactions.\nCOMMODITIES Photo: Bloomberg U.S. farmers and meatpackers are hoping that consumer demand keeps up with growing production. The country produced a record 99.7 billion pounds of red meat and poultry in 2017, the WSJ’s Jacob Bunge and Benjamin Parkin report, and the industry is on track for an even bigger slaughter this year. Tyson Foods Inc. and other meat companies are building new plants that are expected to push U.S. meat production up this year at the fastest pace in two decades. Producers are following up on several years of rapid growth built on domestic and surging export demand, and now they’re set to test forecasts that see nothing but expansion on the horizon. Some analysts are skeptical, and say trade tensions are a cloud on growth projections. Meat producer Prestage Farms Inc. is already concerned the U.S. withdrawal from the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade pact will undermine its recent export-focused investments.\nThe U.S. wheat glut is resisting farmers’ efforts to cut back production. Wheat farmers planted the least acres of winter wheat in over a century, as tumbling prices and strong production overseas pushed more farmers to switch to crops like soybeans and corn. The WSJ’s Benjamin Parkin and Jesse Newman report American farmers are being hurt by bumper harvests in Russia, where exporters are supplying North Africa and the Middle East at a better price than U.S. farmers can offer. While U.S. planting is at a record low, Russia’s exports are at a record high. Regulators say U.S. wheat stockpiles are rising, and strong corn and soybean harvests signal a difficult year for those commodities. The impact has been evident in transport networks: Grain volumes on U.S. railroads fell 13.9% in the second half of 2017, the Association of American Railroads says, and carloads heading to ports for export were down at a double-digit rate.\nQUOTABLE\n‘ Tax reform, a strong economy and a truck-driver shortage all bode well for a strong 2018 from the freight railroad industry. ’\n—Jason Kuehn of consulting firm Oliver Wyman.\nNumber of the Day 7.4% Average availability rate for industrial and logistics space in the fourth quarter, almost unchanged from the previous quarter , according to CBRE Inc.\nIN OTHER NEWS A large Iranian oil tanker that collided with a cargo ship in the East China Sea sank, dashing hopes of finding survivors .
