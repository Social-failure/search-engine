Bush to help farmers and reduce petroleum imports. But as the program has grown, refiners that lack sufficient blending infrastructure have complained of rising costs. \nValero in 2016 spent $750 million buying fuel credits to comply with the program administered by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, according to its financial statements. \nValero had wanted to tweak the RFS program by shifting the responsibility for fuel blending away from refiners and further down the supply chain to storage terminals. Last February, months after Valero joined the RFA, the association announced it had dropped its opposition to that proposal, triggering a backlash from much of the biofuels industry, which was opposed to the change. \nThe proposal, however, was ultimately rejected by the EPA in October, under pressure from Midwest lawmakers and the corn lobby. \nValero spokeswoman Lillian Riojas in the statement said the reason the company did not renew its RFA membership was cost cutting. “As one of the nation’s largest producers of renewable fuels, we expect to continue to work with RFA on the issues that impact our renewables business,” she added. \nBob Dinneen, president of the RFA, confirmed Valero was no longer a member of the group.
