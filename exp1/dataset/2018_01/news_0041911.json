The benchmark climbed 0.8 percent on Tuesday. \nAustralia’s biggest insurer QBE Insurance led the gains on the index, climbing 5.4 percent in its best session since Nov. 2016 as investors spotted the upside following a sharp fall in the previous session. \nThe insurer’s shares fell as much as 6 percent on Tuesday after it flagged a surprise record annual loss of about $1.2 billion, battered by payouts related to natural disasters. \nIt also said it would conduct a strategic review of its Latin American business. \n“The FY18 guidance looks conservatively set and higher quality,” Morgan Stanley said in a note. “The outlook is for a cleaner QBE portfolio, with greater underwriting discipline, supported by improving fundamentals.” \nMacquarie Group Ltd, Australia’s biggest investment bank, rose 1.6 percent to end at an all-time high. \nHealthcare giants CSL Ltd and Cochlear Ltd gained 0.9 percent and 3.5 percent, respectively. CSL closed at a record high. \nCommonwealth Bank of Australia capped the gains on the index, falling 0.8 percent towards the end of the session to finish at its weakest since early December. \nNew Zealand’s benchmark S&P/NZX 50 index rose 0.2 percent or 16.46 points to finish the session at 8,324.09, ahead of inflation data due on Thursday. \nInflation is seen having held steady in the fourth quarter, surpassing central bank expectations, but still unlikely to undermine the bank’s determination to keep rates on hold at record lows. \nA2 Milk Company was among the top performers on the index, up 2.6 percent to finish at a record. \nPayment solutions provider Pushpay Holdings led the gains with a 5.5 percent jump - its best day in nearly six weeks.
