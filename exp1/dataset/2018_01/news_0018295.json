The rise was more than 10 percent for the watch and jewelry business as a whole,” Hublot Chief Executive Ricardo Guadalupe told Reuters in Geneva ahead of an international watch fair.\n“This year, we expect Hublot sales to rise 5-6 percent, maybe 10 percent if things go well,” he added.\nHublot is one of three LVMH luxury watch brands which also include TAG Heuer and Zenith. It counts Bulgari among its top-end jewelry units.\nThe watch fair is dominated by LVMH’s rival Richemont, with Swiss-made luxury timepieces just emerging from a severe downturn as Chinese demand picks up and the industry’s biggest market, Hong Kong, returns to growth.\nOverall, Swiss watch exports rose 2.8 percent in the first eleven months of 2017.\nReporting by Silke Koltrowitz; Editing by Richard Lough and Alexander Smith\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-01-15T02:23:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-14T20:55:32.022+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
