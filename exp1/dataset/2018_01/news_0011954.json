A logo of Ant Financial is displayed at the Ant Financial event in Hong Kong, China November 1, 2016. REUTERS/Bobby Yip/Files \nThe Cyberspace Administration of China (CAC) said in a statement it had summoned Ant Financial representatives to a meeting last Saturday and told them they had failed to meet the country’s personal information security standards. \nThe rap over the knuckles adds to a tough start to the year for Ant Financial which was recently blocked by U.S. regulators from acquiring MoneyGram International Inc. \nIt is also grappling with new regulations, requiring mobile payment firms to sharply increase the amount of client funds in interest-free reserve accounts, which will likely reduce profits. \nAlipay has a popular end-of-year feature that allows its customers to analyse how they have spent their money over the year. At the end of 2017, the feature began enrolling users who wanted to look at their bills into the credit scoring system, Sesame Credit. \nThat allowed Sesame Credit to collect their data and share the analysis with its partners. Users could only opt out if they unchecked a button on the feature’s landing page. \nSesame Credit apologised last week and cancelled the default option. \n“We immediately initiated a comprehensive review of our privacy protection policy across the business,” Ant Financial chief privacy officer Nie Zhengjun said in a statement on Thursday. \nAnt Financial’s board of directors will be responsible for overseeing all privacy-related matters going forward, Nie said. \nCAC said the company should “step up efforts to conduct a comprehensive investigation of the Alipay platform, carry out special rectifications and take effective measures to prevent similar incidents from recurring.” \nIt quoted Alipay and Sesame Credit as saying that they had learned a “profound lesson” from the incident.
