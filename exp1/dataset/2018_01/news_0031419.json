It would also take on PAE Tanzania’s debts worth another $24 million.\nPAE PanAfrican Energy, a wholly owned subsidiary of Orca, supplies natural gas for power generation to about 40 industrial and commercial customers in Tanzania’s commercial capital Dar es Salaam.\nReporting by Fumbuka Ng'wanakilala; Editing by Elias Biryabarema and Edmund Blair\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-19T16:46:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-19T17:03:41.002+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
