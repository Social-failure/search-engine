It’s like I got it and I go and spend. Maybe I will get the presents for my family, first of all, of course. Because I have a big family.\n“And then for myself a bit. Yeah.”\nIt also set up a glamour tie with compatriot and fourth seed Elina Svitolina.\nAppearing completely at ease during her post-match media duties, Kostyuk said she still had to process her achievement before worrying about her next round.\n”I still didn’t think about that match,“ she said. ”I‘m still, with emotions, I‘m still with this match, and it’s my sixth match here.\n“I feel like with every match, I‘m doing better and better.”\nTennis - Australian Open - Margaret Court Arena, Melbourne, Australia, January 17, 2018.

I feel she’s going to be a dangerous player when she grows up.”\nDespite her comprehensive win over the Australian, Kostyuk said she had struggled to control her emotions and was fuming when given a code violation for coaching after her mum gestured at her from the players’ box.\n”I was so mad, because I didn’t see what mom was showing me.\n“Then when the referee said code violation, I was, like, ‘What? I didn’t even see her, like -- like, I swear I didn’t see what she was showing me’.”\nAfter the match, her mum made another intervention, swiping her phone away from her before she could check congratulatory messages.\n“Well, I take the phone, and I had to eat at the same time,” said Kostyuk.\n“My mom told me leave the phone and eat properly. Because I didn’t have normal breakfast, that’s why I felt quite bad today on court.”\n($1 = 1.2553 Australian dollars)\nEditing by Amlan Chakraborty\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-17T06:49:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-17T07:39:44.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
