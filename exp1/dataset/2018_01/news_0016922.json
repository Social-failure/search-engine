(NASDAQ: ACOR) (“Acorda” or the “Company”) shareholders that a class action lawsuit has been filed on behalf of purchasers of the Company’s securities between April 18, 2016 and November 14, 2017 , inclusive (the “Class Period”).\nREMINDER: Acorda shareholders who purchased securities during the Class Period may, no later than January 18, 2018, seek to be appointed as a lead plaintiff representative of the class. For additional information or to learn how to participate in this action please visit https://www.ktmc.com/new-cases/acorda-therapeutics-inc#join .\nShareholders who wish to discuss this action and their legal options are encouraged to contact Kessler Topaz Meltzer & Check, LLP (Darren J. Check, Esq., D. Seamus Kaskela, Esq. or Adrienne Bell, Esq.) at (888) 299-7706 or at info@ktmc.com .\nAcorda is a biotechnology company focused on the identification, development, and commercialization of therapies for neurological disorders. On January 19, 2016, Acorda announced an agreement to acquire Biotie Therapies Corporation (“Biotie”) for approximately $363 million (the “Biotie Acquisition”). In connection with the Biotie Acquisition, Acorda announced that it would “obtain worldwide rights to tozadenant, an oral adenosine A2a receptor antagonist currently in Phase 3 development in Parkinson’s disease.”\nAmong other things, the shareholder class action complaint alleges that Acorda and certain of its senior executive officers made a series of false and misleading statements and/or failed to disclose to investors that: (i) tozadenant entailed significant undisclosed safety risks; (ii) the Company had overstated tozadenant’s approval prospects and commercial viability; and (iii) for the foregoing reasons, the Company had likewise overstated the benefits of the Biotie Acquisition.\nOn November 15, 2017, Acorda disclosed the deaths of several patients enrolled in final-stage studies of tozadenant. The Company further disclosed that it had paused new enrollment in the drug’s long-term safety studies, pending further discussion with the independent Data Safety Monitoring Board and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.\nOn this news, shares of Acorda’s stock fell $11.20 per share, or nearly 40%, to close on November 15, 2017 at $17.00 per share, on heavy trading volume.\nAcorda shareholders may, no later than January 18, 2018 , petition the Court to be appointed as a lead plaintiff representative of the class through Kessler Topaz Meltzer & Check or other counsel, or may choose to do nothing and remain an absent class member. A lead plaintiff is a representative party who acts on behalf of all class members in directing the litigation. In order to be appointed as a lead plaintiff, the Court must determine that the class member’s claim is typical of the claims of other class members, and that the class member will adequately represent the class in the action. Your ability to share in any recovery is not affected by the decision of whether or not to serve as a lead plaintiff.
