We have to prepare solid ground for peaceful and credible elections so that the results will be respected by all the parties.” \nThe U.N. is trying to revive a stalled peace plan for Libya that was signed in December 2015. \nThe last time the country held elections, in 2014, the results were disputed and a conflict that developed after a 2011 uprising deepened, resulting in rival governments being established in Tripoli and the east.
