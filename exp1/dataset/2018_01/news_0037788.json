A ratio below 100 percent indicates the insurer earns more in premiums than it pays out in claims and expenses.\nDespite rising interest rates, net investment income fell 5.3 percent to $467 million.\nTravelers’ revenue rose 3.6 percent to $7.45 billion.\nReporting by Nikhil Subba in Bengaluru and Suzanne Barlyn in New York; Editing by Arun Koyyur and Jeffrey Benkoe\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-23T14:01:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-23T14:16:12.014+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
