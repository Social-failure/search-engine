Fourth quarter net income was $877,000, or $0.30 per diluted share, which includes a $325,000, or $0.11 per share, one-time tax expense related to recently enacted tax reforms. In the fourth quarter of 2016, net income was $932,000, or $0.34 diluted share. For the full year 2017, net income increased 20% to $3.7 million, or $1.28 per share, compared to $3.1 million, or $1.12 per share for 2016.\nWith the signing into law of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, generally accepted accounting principles required deferred tax assets (DTAs) on corporate balance sheets be revalued to reflect the net present value of the future tax benefits based on the new 21% top rate, which replaces the 35% top rate. As a result of this accounting change, the Company made a one-time adjustment to the value of its DTAs causing a tax expense of $325,000. The following table presents a year-to-year comparison of key financial results before the one-time adjustment.\nComparison of 2017 vs. 2016 without the effect of the accounting adjustment to deferred tax assets SELECT FINANCIAL INFORMATION AND RATIOS\n(unaudited) Year to Date as of: Dec. 31, 2017 Dec. 31, 2016 Percent Change Income before DTA adjustment $ 4,008 $ 3,074 30 % Basic earnings per share before DTA $ 1.42 $ 1.13 26 % Fully diluted earnings per share before DTA $ 1.39 $ 1.12 25 % Return on average assets before DTA 1.09 % .98 % 11 % Return on average equity before DTA 12.23 % 10.90 % 12 %\n“While the benefits of lower tax rates in 2018 and beyond will be substantial for our Company and for most U.S. corporations, balance sheet adjustments for DTAs are generating considerable inconsistencies in fourth quarter earnings for many companies, and we are no different,” said Steve Miller, President and Chief Executive Officer. “Excluding the DTA adjustment, net income increased 30% for the year, 14% from the preceding quarter and 29% for the fourth quarter compared to a year ago. Revenues were solid; deposits were up 12% for the year and 9% on a linked quarter basis, reflecting the strength of our franchise and growth in new customer relationships,” added Miller.\n“We continue to expand our Small Business Administration (“SBA”) lending initiatives, and have again been declared the top Community Bank SBA Lender for the 15 county Fresno District for the fifth consecutive year,” commented Miller. “Overall, the team added quality customer relationships to our portfolio through organic expansion in our core markets. Our customer acquisition success was a direct result of enhanced marketing techniques in both the digital and traditional channels, better leveraging our referral partners and maximizing existing relationships that are a part of a larger “ecosystem” of potential clients. Our participation in programs like Hybrid Crowd Funding provides us access to the local start-up community in the central valley, which enables us to further expand and diversify our customer base.\nFourth quarter 2017 Highlights (as of, or for the quarter ended December 31, 2017):\nPre-tax net income was $2.0 million, up 24% from $1.6 million for the fourth quarter of 2016 and up 16% on a linked quarter basis.

In addition, during the third quarter of this year, we repositioned a portion of our securities portfolio resulting in a gain of $110,000, which is not a normal event.” Debit/credit card interchange income was up 31% and merchant services income also increased 24% year-over-year on higher volumes.

For the full year of 2017, the net interest margin was 4.11%, compared to 4.08% for 2016.\nOperating expenses totaled $2.2 million for the fourth quarter of 2017, compared to $2.0 million for the fourth quarter of 2016 and $2.3 million on a linked quarter basis.
