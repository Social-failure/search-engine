(Nasdaq: AGYS), a global provider of next-generation hospitality software solutions and services, today reported operating results for its fiscal 2018 third quarter ended December 31, 2017.\nSummary of Fiscal 2018 Third Quarter Financial Results\nTotal net revenue was $31.3 million, compared to total net revenue of $33.4 million in the comparable prior-year period. Recurring revenues (which are comprised of support, maintenance and subscription services) were $17.2 million, or 55% of total net revenue, compared to $16.2 million, or 49% of total net revenue, for the same period in fiscal 2017. SaaS revenues increased 26% year over year and comprised 29% of total recurring revenues, compared to 24% of total recurring revenues in the third quarter of fiscal 2017. Gross margin was 49.9% in the fiscal 2018 third quarter, compared to 48.6% in the prior-year period. Net loss in the fiscal 2018 third quarter was $(1.9) million, or $(0.08) per diluted share, compared to a net loss of $(1.7) million, or $(0.08) per diluted share, in the prior-year period. Adjusted EBITDA (non-GAAP) was $2.1 million, compared to Adjusted EBITDA of $3.0 million in the same period last year (see reconciliation below). Adjusted earnings from operations (non-GAAP) in the fiscal 2018 third quarter was $(1.9) million, and includes the impact of approximately $0.7 million in one-time capital expenditures related to the doubling of headcount capacity in India with the opening of additional office space at that facility. Adjusted earnings from operations in the fiscal 2017 third quarter was $(1.4) million (see reconciliation below).\nRamesh Srinivasan, President and CEO of Agilysys, commented, “We continue to make good progress with the various strategic initiatives implemented in early fiscal 2018. These steps are designed to position Agilysys for near and long term growth and profitability. Our recurring revenue base continues to improve, reaching a record level this quarter. SaaS revenue grew 26% over fiscal Q3 2017, continuing to grow faster than the rest of our recurring revenue. Compared to the first nine months of fiscal 2017, adjusted EBITDA increased 28% and adjusted earnings from operations improved 16%, notwithstanding the impact of approximately $1.6M in capital expenditures related to the opening and expansion of the India Development Center.\n“Our current top-line results do not yet reflect our business momentum. We continue to see significant growth opportunities in the market place, including a marked increase in competitive replacement sales contracts during the last four months of calendar 2017. To ensure that Agilysys is well positioned for the future, we have increased our technical development capacity by 60% so far during fiscal 2018, while simultaneously lowering costs as a percentage of revenue compared to Q4 of fiscal 2017. We enter the fourth quarter of this fiscal year with a significantly more efficient overall cost structure and an energized workforce eager to move our product innovation and good business execution initiatives forward.\n“Going forward, we expect to better leverage our growing R&D capacity and operational efficiencies, new sales leadership and initiatives, improving go-to-market initiatives in international regions, strengthening partnerships with large international operators and growing contributions from SaaS and annual software maintenance revenues, to drive profitable growth.”\nFiscal 2018 Outlook\nAgilysys expects that the Company’s full year fiscal 2018 revenue will be towards the low end of the previously provided range of $130 million to $134 million. The Company reiterated its previously provided expectation that it will generate positive Adjusted Earnings from Operations (non-GAAP measure) in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018.\nThe Company defines adjusted earnings from operations as adjusted EBITDA, less capital expenditures and capitalized software development costs, which management believes is a meaningful measure of earnings and provides insight to investors on the Company’s overall profitability and cash generation from core operations. Adjusted earnings from operations includes costs for capitalized efforts while minimizing the seasonality of the Company’s cash flows due to the timing of billing.\nTony Pritchett, Chief Financial Officer, commented, “We are pleased with the execution and progress with our strategic initiatives during the first nine months of fiscal 2018. While revenue for the third quarter of fiscal 2018 was less than the comparable quarter last fiscal year, the mix of revenue continues to improve, which is a good trend for us. We continue to be prudent and sensible with the management of our cost structure. Our expectation for positive Adjusted Earnings from Operations in the fourth quarter remains, and the cash balance should be at or slightly higher than the $38.5 million level we saw at the end of the second quarter of fiscal 2018. Going forward, we expect to leverage our ability to grow revenue along with our significantly streamlined cost structure to generate shareholder value.”\n2018 Third Quarter Conference Call and Webcast\nAgilysys is hosting a conference call and webcast today, January 25, 2018, beginning at 4:30 p.m. ET.
