It is my great privilege to join the Prentice board and bring a unique perspective to hopefully help more families see their children grow in such a wonderful way.”\nAlicia Maciel, Executive Director at The Prentice School says, “As a Prentice parent, Dr. Bixby has first-hand experience of our mission. She has been a strong supporter of the school refinements we have implemented to ensure our students receive a high-quality education. We are honored to add her visionary leadership and diverse skill set to our Board of Directors.\"\n“We are thrilled to have Dr. Bixby join the Prentice board,” says Mark Gaines, Prentice board President. “Not only is she a current Prentice parent that can provide real-time perspective on how we are doing, but she is also a medical professional that can provide us perspective on how to better partner with the medical community in providing educational services for children with learning differences.”\n“Prentice is a phenomenal place that has changed the direction of my son's educational career. School has become a safe, supportive, fun, and successful place to be for a child who previously ran and hid when told school would be starting again,\" says Dr. Bixby. “At Prentice, the positive transformation of every student is truly magical. I have trusted the Prentice board and educational team with my child and I am so grateful and impressed with how he has grown academically, socially and in his confidence.”\nDr. Bixby is also an International Board Certified Lactation Consultant and the Lactation Medical Director at CHOC Children’s Hospital where she focuses on breastmilk handling and breastfeeding support in the NICU.
