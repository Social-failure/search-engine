I was just really happy for him.” \nAll-rounder Mitchell’s first test hundred came after he was called into the team for the third Ashes clash in Perth and was a reward for the hard work he did on his batting after his recuperation from surgery. \n“To be honest I really didn’t think I was going to play any part for Australia this summer,” he said. \n“It’s been a whirlwind month for both of us really and we’re just both really happy to be here now and to be contributing to a winning Australian team.” \nShaun’s recall for the series was his eighth and caused huge controversy, the selectors being vindicated when he scored an unbeaten 126 in Adelaide. \n“Six months ago I lost my contract and was left out of the test team and didn’t know what the future held at this level,” he recalled. \n“I went away and wanted to just enjoy myself and when I did get picked again it was emotional.” \nShaun’s 156 on Sunday was his sixth test century and, combined with Mitchell’s 101, helped put Australia in a strong position to claim a 4-0 series victory on the final day on Monday. \nNeither brother, though, was prepared to consider yet whether they might retain their places for the tour of South Africa later this year. \n“It’s been nice contributing to the team over the last few weeks and today,” said Shaun. “I’ll just keep working hard, keep enjoying it, and not look too far ahead.” (Editing by Amlan Chakraborty)", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-07T10:46:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-07T11:20:53.001+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
