City AM reported that U.S. buyout house Carlyle was planning a bid of its own.\nMelrose (down 0.2 percent) said it plans to meet GKN shareholders to convince them of the benefits of its 7 billion- pound offer, which GKN management had rejected.\nJohnson Matthey shares were one of the biggest risers, up 2.1 percent after broker Berenberg raised its target price for the shares.\nAcacia Mining rose 2.7 percent after it reported gold production in the last quarter of 2017 exceeded expectations.\nGold prices on Monday rose to their highest since September, buoyed by a weaker U.S. dollar, which slumped to three-year lows against a basket of currencies.\nBritish bookmaker William Hill rose 0.5 percent after saying its adjusted operating profit for 2017 would rise 11 percent year-on-year, beating analyst expectations, thanks to strong trading in recent weeks and favourable sporting results.\nBP and Royal Dutch Shell retreated 0.3 percent as oil prices held just below December 2014 highs .\nFinancials also weighed on the index with Standard Chartered losing 1.2 percent and HSBC 0.6 percent.
