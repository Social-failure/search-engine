All parties are urged to remain cautious,” Agung Pribadi, press relations officer at the natural resources ministry, said in a statement. \nThe volcano has been spewing lava and ash since late November, when authorities raised the alert status to the highest. \nBali airport was closed for three days, leaving thousands of tourists stranded and prompting others to cancel their year-end holiday plans.
