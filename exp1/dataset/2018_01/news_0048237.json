REUTERS/Anton Vaganov He said some of the protests had been thinly attended.\nAsked whether the Kremlin considered Navalny a threat, Peskov said “no”.\nAround 1,500 protesters converged at a square adjacent to the Kremlin on Sunday, with hundreds also attending rallies in St. Petersburg, Russia’s second-biggest city, in Yekaterinburg in the Ural mountains, and other major centers.\nMoments after Navalny appeared at Sunday’s rally in Moscow he was wrestled into a patrol wagon and taken into detention.\nHe was released around midnight without charges, his lawyer Olga Mikhailova told Reuters, but would face court at a later date.\nIf charged with violating laws on holding demonstrations, Navalny could face up to 30 days in prison.\nWriting by Polina Ivanova; Editing by Andrew Osborn and Jeremy Gaunt\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-29T12:11:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-29T12:30:06.017+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
