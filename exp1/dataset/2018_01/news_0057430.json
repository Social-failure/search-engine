Real people would lose the benefits they need.\"\nSocial Security provides retirement, disability and survivor benefits to qualifying recipients, the bulk of whom are age 65 or older. The Social Security trust fund, which helps support it, is projected to be depleted by 2035. At that point, unless changes are made, recipients will receive only about 75 percent of benefits , according to the Social Security Board of Trustees.\nMedicare, which provides healthcare coverage for some 50 million older Americans, is also in jeopardy.\n\"Medicare still faces a substantial financial shortfall that will need to be addressed with further legislation,\" according to a 2017 report by the program trustees. \"Such legislation should be enacted sooner rather than later to minimize the impact on beneficiaries, providers, and taxpayers,\" the report said.\nBetween 2010 and 2050, the population of people over the age of 65 in America will double , according to The Kaiser Family Foundation.

Tom Cole, R- Oklahoma, told CNBC in December that \"tax cuts produce growth, entitlement spending doesn't.\"\nDavid Kamin, a former economic policy advisor in the Obama administration and a law professor at New York University, said Trump's silence on these programs in the State of the Union address was purposeful.\n\"The fact that he didn't mention any of these things indicates this isn't an area where he is willing to discuss with the American people the actual trade-offs that the tax cut involves,\" Kamin said.\nMore from Personal Finance\nTrump cites 401(k) gains, yet most workers don't have one\nTrump touts college savings gains in speech, but ignore student debt\nEquifax extends free credit freezes until June 30", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-31T19:45:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-31T20:31:04.579+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
