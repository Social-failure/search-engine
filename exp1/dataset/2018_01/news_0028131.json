Before coming to this tournament, I tried to adjust and fix my swing flaws with my coach,” Chapchai told reporters. \n”Today, I was attempting to play the same way as I did during practice and follow my coach’s advice. \n“For this tournament, I didn’t think too much and I didn’t set any target. I‘m just enjoying the experience and trying to get used to my new golf swing as well as getting a better swing rhythm.” \n“For the next two days, I will do the same as I did today and don’t think much about the result.” \nIndia’s Shiv Kapur shot a 67 to lie just two shots off the lead alongside Americans Jarin Todd (66) and Casey O‘Toole, who could complete only six holes in his second round.
