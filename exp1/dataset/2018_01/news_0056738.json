It also adds pressure on Jia, who has defied Chinese regulators’ orders to return from the United States, where he has been based since the summer. \nJia resigned as chairman and CEO from Leshi after property developer Sunac China made a $2 billion investment last year in Leshi to become its second-largest shareholder. But he remains Leshi’s largest shareholder with a 25.67 percent stake, though most of that has been pledged to financial institutions. \nLeshi, which makes internet-connected TVs and produces video entertainment, was deeply intertwined with LeEco units for related transactions but is increasingly trying to distance itself from the conglomerate. \nWith loans and financial liabilities of around $1.5 billion, Leshi said last week it is seeking equity stakes in the car businesses of Jia, including Faraday Future, for debts owed by him and LeEco units totalling 7.5 billion yuan. LeEco has disputed that figure. \nLeEco did not immediately respond to an emailed request for a comment. \nLeshi is due to report 2017 results on April 24. \nIts shares plunged by the daily limit of 10 percent on Wednesday, the sixth consecutive day they have tumbled the maximum allowed since resuming trading a week ago following a nine-month suspension. \nShares of Sunac China dropped as much as 5.4 percent in Hong Kong on Wednesday morning before recouping the loss by noon.
