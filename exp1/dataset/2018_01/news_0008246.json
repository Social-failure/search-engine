But it is not clear when, or if, Republicans and Democrats in Congress will agree to restore funding to CHIP, despite the program being popular across party lines.\nCHIP covers about 9 million kids. The Health Affairs report noted that the Trump administration, in its 2018 budget proposal, has called for \"substantial cuts\" to CHIP and the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, \"which directs three-quarters of its benefits to households with children.\"\nThe report's authors said they believed their analysis was the first study to compare mortality among children of all ages in the United States to other wealthy countries.\nThe other countries examined in the study were Australia, Austria, Belgium, Canada, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Iceland, Ireland, Italy, Japan, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland and the United Kingdom.\nIn the first decade examined, from 1961 through 1970, the death rate among kids under age 1 in the U.S. were 240.7 per 10,000, a slightly better rate than 250.3 deaths per 10,000 in the other countries, according to the analysis.\nThe mortality rate among children age 1 to 19 during that decade was the same in the U.S. as in the other 19 countries: 6.7 deaths per 10,000 kids.\nBut starting in 1971, the U.S. child mortality rate was higher than the other 19 countries, even as that rate dropped significantly in each decade.\nFor the decade ending in 2010, the mortality rate among infants in the U.S. was 68.8 per 10,000. In the 19 other countries, the rate was just 39 deaths for 10,000.\nAmong children age 1 to 19, the mortality rate in the U.S. was 3.1 per 10,000 compared to 2.0 per 10,000 in the 19 other countries.\nThe authors of the analysis said that a higher rate of deaths related to babies born prematurely was a key reason for the U.S. outpacing other nations in infant mortality, as was a higher rate of injuries among that age group.\nThe report also said that for children ages 15 to 19 in the U.S., the two most common causes of death were motor vehicle accidents and assaults involving a gun.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-08T23:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-08T23:03:01.069+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
