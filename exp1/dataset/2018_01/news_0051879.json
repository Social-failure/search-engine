Net Income in the fourth quarter 2017 benefited from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act that was signed into law in December 2017. The net financial impacts were reflected in Other After-Tax Adjustments and were excluded from non-GAAP operating earnings. The impact included: A $625.6 million benefit from the re-measurement of our net deferred tax liability using the lower corporate tax rate; A $43.1 million one-time deemed repatriation tax expense on foreign earnings; and A $14.2 million reduced tax benefit of foreign dividends paid and lower future tax benefits from investments. Non-GAAP operating earnings for fourth quarter 2017 of $350.8 million, compared to $372.0 million for fourth quarter 2016.

Quarterly common stock dividend of $0.51 per share for first quarter 2018 was authorized by the company’s Board of Directors, bringing the trailing twelve-month dividend to $1.93 per share, a 15 percent increase compared to the prior year trailing twelve-month period. The dividend will be payable on Mar. 29, 2018, to shareholders of record as of Mar. 5, 2018.\n“2017 was a very good year for Principal,” said Dan Houston, chairman, president and CEO. “We had record net income for the year; and record non-GAAP operating earnings, despite the fourth quarter decline. We also increased AUM by $77 billion, or 13 percent, in 2017, to $669 billion at year-end, creating solid momentum going into 2018.”\n“Throughout the year, we continued to deliver strong investment performance, to expand our solution set, and enhance relationships with customers and distributors,” Houston added. “We again balanced investments in growth with disciplined expense management. We committed $180 million to strategic acquisitions in 2017; and we distributed more than $730 million to shareholders through common stock dividends and share buybacks, reflecting our balanced approach to capital deployment and our ongoing commitment to creating long-term value for our shareholders.”\nOther highlights\nFourth Quarter\nRetirement and Income Solutions (RIS) sales of $4.3 billion, $2.9 billion in RIS-Fee and $1.4 billion in RIS-Spread, helped drive end of period account values to $265.0 billion, a 15 percent increase over the prior year quarter. Principal Global Investors (PGI) ended the quarter with record AUM of $430.9 billion. Pre-tax return on operating revenues less pass-through commissions 2 increased to 37.0 percent on a trailing twelve-month basis, a 30-basis point increase from a year ago.

Specialty Benefits premium and fees 3 increased 9 percent compared to the year ago quarter. Individual Life premium and fees increased 8 percent over the year ago quarter.\nFull-Year 2017\nStrong Morningstar investment performance 4 , with 76 percent of Principal’s investment options above median on a one-year basis, 69 percent on a three-year basis and 83 percent on a five-year basis. In Retirement and Income Solutions-Spread, full year pension risk transfer sales were a record $2.8 billion. Principal International reported record combined 5 net revenues (at PFG share) of $922.0 million in 2017, an increase of 16 percent over 2016. U.S. Insurance Solutions sales were a record at $560.0 million, up 6 percent over prior year. Deployed $913.0 million of capital. This included: $540.0 million of common stock dividends, including the $0.49 per share common dividend paid in the fourth quarter; $193.0 million to repurchase 3.1 million shares of common stock; and $180.0 million in acquisitions and increased ownership in PGI boutiques. Strong capital position with estimated statutory risk-based capital (RBC) ratio for Principal Life Insurance Company of 445 percent at year-end, above our 415-425 targeted range. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act had an immaterial impact on our estimated RBC ratio at year-end.

The company does not undertake to update these statements, which are based on a number of assumptions concerning future conditions that may ultimately prove to be inaccurate. Future events and their effects on the company may not be those anticipated, and actual results may differ materially from the results anticipated in these forward-looking statements. The risks, uncertainties and factors that could cause or contribute to such material differences are discussed in the company’s annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended Dec. 31, 2016, and in the company’s quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended Sept. 30, 2017, filed by the company with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, as updated or supplemented from time to time in subsequent filings. These risks and uncertainties include, without limitation: adverse capital and credit market conditions may significantly affect the company’s ability to meet liquidity needs, access to capital and cost of capital; conditions in the global capital markets and the economy generally; volatility or declines in the equity, bond or real estate markets; changes in interest rates or credit spreads or a sustained low interest rate environment; the company’s investment portfolio is subject to several risks that may diminish the value of its invested assets and the investment returns credited to customers; the company’s valuation of investments and the determination of the amount of allowances and impairments taken on such investments may include methodologies, estimations and assumptions that are subject to differing interpretations; any impairments of or valuation allowances against the company’s deferred tax assets; the company’s actual experience could differ significantly from its pricing and reserving assumptions; the pattern of amortizing the company’s DAC and other actuarial balances on its universal life-type insurance contracts, participating life insurance policies and certain investment contracts may change; changes in laws, regulations or accounting standards; the company may not be able to protect its intellectual property and may be subject to infringement claims; the company’s ability to pay stockholder dividends and meet its obligations may be constrained by the limitations on dividends Iowa insurance laws impose on Principal Life; litigation and regulatory investigations; from time to time the company may become subject to tax audits, tax litigation or similar proceedings, and as a result it may owe additional taxes, interest and penalties in amounts that may be material; applicable laws and the company’s certificate of incorporation and by-laws may discourage takeovers and business combinations that some stockholders might consider in their best interests; competition, including from companies that may have greater financial resources, broader arrays of products, higher ratings and stronger financial performance; a downgrade in the company’s financial strength or credit ratings; client terminations, withdrawals or changes in investor preferences; inability to attract and retain qualified employees and sales representatives and develop new distribution sources; an interruption in telecommunication, information technology or other systems, or a failure to maintain the confidentiality, integrity or availability of data residing on such systems; international business risks; fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates; the company may need to fund deficiencies in its “Closed Block” assets; the company’s reinsurers could default on their obligations or increase their rates; risks arising from acquisitions of businesses; and loss of key vendor relationships or failure of a vendor to protect information of our customers or employees.\nUse of Non-GAAP financial measures\nThe company uses a number of non-GAAP financial measures that management believes are useful to investors because they illustrate the performance of normal, ongoing operations, which is important in understanding and evaluating the company’s financial condition and results of operations. They are not, however, a substitute for U.S. GAAP financial measures. Therefore, the company has provided reconciliations of the non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP measure at the end of the release. The company adjusts U.S. GAAP measures for items not directly related to ongoing operations. However, it is possible these adjusting items have occurred in the past and could recur in future reporting periods. Management also uses non-GAAP measures for goal setting, as a basis for determining employee and senior management awards and compensation, and evaluating performance on a basis comparable to that used by investors and securities analysts.\nEarnings conference call\nOn Tuesday, Jan. 30, 2018, at 10:00 a.m. (ET), Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer Dan Houston and Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer Deanna Strable will lead a discussion of results and the impacts on future prospects, asset quality and capital adequacy during a live conference call, which can be accessed as follows:\nVia live Internet webcast.
