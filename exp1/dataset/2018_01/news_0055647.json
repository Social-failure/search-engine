Turnover was 3.6 trillion yen, the highest since early December.\nThirty-one of the Topix’s 33 subsectors were in negative territory, with mining companies and steelmakers among Wednesday’s big losers.\nInpex Corp dropped 2.4 percent and Nippon Steel & Sumitomo Metal shed 2.1 percent.\nBucking the weakness, Advantest Corp jumped 5.7 percent after it raised its net profit outlook to 15 billion yen ($137.96 mln) from 14.5 billion yen for the fiscal year ending March 2018.
