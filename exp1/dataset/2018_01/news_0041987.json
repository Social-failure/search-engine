I would expect inflation to begin to decline,” he told the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland on Thursday.\nHammond sat beside U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, who sent the U.S. dollar tumbling on Wednesday with his remark that a weaker greenback helped U.S. trade. Hammond talked of a rebound in sterling and turned to Mnuchin: “And we seem to be recovering quite a bit more, Steve, thanks very much.” (Reporting by Alessandra Galloni and Soyoung Kim in DAVOS; Exditing by Mark Bendeich)\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-01-25T18:55:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-26T21:27:12.041+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
