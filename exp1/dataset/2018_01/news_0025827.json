Since then, there have been frequent clashes between Palestinians and Israeli forces in the West Bank and along the Israel-Gaza border. \nPalestinians want mostly Arab East Jerusalem as the capital of a future state. Israel took East Jerusalem in the 1967 Middle East war and annexed it in a move internationally unrecognised. It sees the entire city as its eternal, indivisible capital. \nA total of 18 Palestinians and one Israeli have been killed in the flare-up since Trump’s announcement, though analysts say neither Israel nor the Palestinians are interested in a major escalation.
