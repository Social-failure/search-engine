They are controlled by Japan but claimed also by China.\n“The presence of the submarine in Japan’s contiguous waters, along with that of the frigate, has unilaterally raised tensions. We are deeply concerned,” Defence Minister Itsunori Onodera told reporters.\nJapanese Vice Foreign Minister Shinzuke Sugiyama telephoned China’s ambassador to Japan, Cheng Yonghua, to lodge a strong protest and demand measures be taken to prevent a repeat, the ministry said in a statement.\nChina routinely rejects Japanese criticism of such patrols, saying its ships have every right to operate in what China calls its territorial waters.\nReporting by Elaine Lies; Editing by Simon Cameron-Moore\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-12T12:40:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-12T13:32:00.013+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
