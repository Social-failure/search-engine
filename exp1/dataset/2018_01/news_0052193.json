RECORD GROWTH SPURS DEMANDS \nIG Metall’s call for all-day strikes comes after union leaders and employers in the southwestern state of Baden-Wuerttemberg, home to companies such as Mercedes-Benz maker Daimler ( DAIGn.DE ) and sports car firm Porsche ( VOWG_p.DE ), failed to reach agreement in 16 hours of talks overnight. \nEmboldened by the fastest economic growth in six years and record low unemployment, IG Metall is demanding an 8 percent pay rise for 3.9 million metals and engineering workers across Germany for 27 months. \nIt has also asked for workers to be given the right to reduce their weekly hours to 28 from 35 to care for children, elderly or sick relatives, and return to full time after two years. \nIt said on Saturday it had offered concessions to employers in the latest round of talks, proposing a flexible model allowing workers to choose between extra money and time off. \nEmployers have offered a 6.8 percent increase but have rejected the demand for shorter hours unless they can also increase workers’ hours when necessary. \n“The union kept coming with new ideas that drove up the price more and more,” regional employers’ association Suedwestmetall said. \nIG Metall, meanwhile, blamed the employers for the lack of a deal, saying they had gotten lost in details during the talks rather than seeking agreement on the major issues. \nThis is IG Metall’s first major push for shorter hours since workers staged seven weeks of strikes in 1984 to help push through a cut of the working week to 35 hours from 40 hours. \nAny deal in Baden-Wuerttemberg would typically be applied in other German states as well.
