A woman walks in strong wind caused by Typhoon Lan, past an electronic board showing the graphs of the recent movements of Japan's Nikkei average outside a brokerage in Tokyo, Japan, October 23, 2017. REUTERS/Issei Kato \nMSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan dropped 0.15 percent from its record high as resource shares declined after oil and other commodities succumbed to profit-taking after recent gains. \nJapan’s Nikkei fell 0.4 percent from its 26-year peak hit the previous day. \nWall Street paused its rally, hit by a 1.2 percent fall in energy stocks as well as weakness in General Electric. The U.S. conglomerate raised the prospect of breaking itself up and announced more than $11 billion in charges from its long-term care insurance portfolio and new U.S. tax laws. \nCboe volatility index, which measures investors’ expectation on price swings in U.S. shares, rose to a one-month closing high of 11.66 from near record low levels seen earlier this month. \nWorld shares have rallied since the start of this year on prospects of strong global growth and improving earnings in the U.S. and elsewhere. \nIndeed, MSCI’s broadest gauge of the world’s stock markets rose 0.3 percent to another record high on Tuesday, extending its gain so far this month to 4.2 percent. \n“U.S. corporate earnings are beating estimates more than usual. People have been talking about ‘goldilocks economy’,” said Soichiro Monji, chief strategist at Daiwa SB Investments, adding market fundamentals remain solid. “Now they are starting to think a ‘red-hot’ economy may be a better description.” \nIn the currency market, the dollar was broadly weak, sticking near a three year low against a basket of currencies. \n“As more countries in the world are starting to unwind their stimulus, the dollar’s yield advantage will shrink and prompt a correction in the dollar’s strength since 2014,” said Minori Uchida, chief FX analyst at Bank of Tokyo Mitsubishi-UFJ. \nThe Bank of Canada is widely expected to raise its benchmark interest rate by 25 basis points to 1.25 percent later in the day, with analysts expecting three hikes this year. \nInvestors also expect the European Central Bank’s eventual exit from stimulus as a major market theme for this year. \nThree sources close to the ECB’s policy told Reuters that the ECB is unlikely to ditch a pledge to keep buying bonds at next week’s meeting just yet as rate setters need more time to assess the outlook for the economy and the euro. \nAlthough the report briefly pushed down the euro on Tuesday, the currency scaled a three-year high of $1.2323 in Asian trade on Wednesday. \nThe ECB last week signalled a growing appetite for revising its policy message in “early” 2018, and specifically a promise to continue its 2.55 trillion euro money-printing programme until inflation heads back to target \nThe dollar also hit a four-month low of 110.19 yen before steadying around 110.56 yen. The Chinese yuan flirted with Monday’s two-year high in both onshore and offshore trade. \nGold traded at $1,340.6 per ounce, near Monday’s four-month peak of $1,344.7. \nOn the other hand, digital currencies tumbled, with bitcoin falling to a six-week low of $10,162 after reports said South Korea and China could ban trading, which intensified fears of a wider regulatory crackdown. \n“Cryptocurrencies could be capped in the current quarter ahead of G20 meeting in March, where policymakers could discuss tighter regulations,” said Shuhei Fujise, chief analyst at Alt Design. \nBitcoin traded at $10,968, down 3.7 percent in Asia, after a fall of 16.3 percent on Tuesday, its biggest daily decline in four months. \nOil prices pulled back from three-year highs as traders booked profits but healthy demand underpinned prices near $70 per barrel, a level not seen since the market slump in 2014. \nPrices have been driven up by oil production curbs in OPEC nations and Russia, and demand amid healthy economic growth \nU.S. crude futures traded little changed at $63.80 per barrel after hitting a December 2014 peak of $64.89 on Tuesday. \nGlobal benchmark Brent crude futures fetched $69.24 a barrel, off a peak of $70.37 on Monday, which matched a high from December 2014 at the start of a three-year market decline.
