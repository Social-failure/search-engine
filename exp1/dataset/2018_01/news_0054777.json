The 22 victims included seven children while more than 500 were injured.\nAfterwards Parker, 33, told reporters he had rushed into the venue following the blast, comforting a badly injured girl who had lost both her legs and cradling a woman with serious head and leg wounds who died in his arms.\nHis story drew praise in the media and widespread public sympathy with a crowdfunding page raising more than 52,000 pounds ($73,000) to help him.\nHowever, he was sentenced to four years and three months in jail at Manchester Crown Court on Tuesday having admitted at an earlier hearing that he had stolen a purse from a woman and a mobile phone from a 14-year-old girl, both of whom had been seriously injured in the attack.\nHe also pleaded guilty to fraud for later using a bank card in the stolen purse at a restaurant.\n“Christopher Parker entered Manchester Arena in the immediate aftermath of the explosion,” said Ben Southam from the Crown Prosecution Service.\n“It was a devastating and distressing scene, and while he did offer some comfort and assistance to a number of victims who had been injured by the bomb, the evidence showed he was also looking for opportunities to take advantage of the situation.”\nReporting by Michael Holden; editing by Stephen Addison\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-30T15:59:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-30T16:08:59.008+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
