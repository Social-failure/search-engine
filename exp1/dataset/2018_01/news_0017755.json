On Thursday, the benchmark shed 0.5 percent. \nOn Friday, material stocks were lifted by iron ore supply concerns stemming from a cyclone brewing in northwest Australia. \nSpot iron ore .IO62-CNO=MB touched its strongest level in nearly five months overnight, boosted by the possibility of a tropical cyclone off the nation’s west coast choking supply. \nAustralia’s metals and mining index finished 2 pct higher at its best in nearly half a decade. \nMining heavyweight BHP rose as much as 2.6 percent, hiked to its best close since September 2014, while rival Rio Tinto advanced 1.7 percent to its highest in well over six years. \nSouth32 Ltd, the third-largest miner by market capitalization, spiked 4 percent to a record close. \nHowever, financials dampened market cheer, with Commonwealth Bank of Australia and Australia and New Zealand Banking Group shedding 0.5 percent and 0.7 percent each. \nANZ said it will not sell its vehicle finance unit - New Zealand’s largest non-bank lender - to China’s HNA Group after New Zealand blocked the deal over concerns about the vendor’s ownership structure. \nNew Zealand’s benchmark S&P/NZX 50 index erased earlier gains to end 0.1 percent lower at 8242.35, its worst week in over a year. \nFalling healthcare and consumer staples stocks offset gains in utilities and energy, with Fisher & Paykel Healthcare Corp Ltd, the biggest weight on the index, extending losses to a fifth session. \nEnergy utility provider Infratil Ltd rose 2.6 percent and helped the index the most. \nNew Zealand-listed shares of ANZ shed 0.8 percent to close at its lowest since Dec. 15 after the bank nixed its deal with HNA Group.
