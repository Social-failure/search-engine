She fights for every point, and it’s always so special when you feel this fight on court.”\nBroken early, Sabalenka won four games in a row en route to a 5-2 lead in the first set when Zhang staged a comeback to level it at 5-5 before the Belarusian clinched the set.\nSabalenka was more in control in the second set when she claimed a decisive break at 4-3 before serving out to set up a quarter-final clash with fifth seed Lesia Tsurenko of Ukraine.\n“It’s always special when you beat two good players in a row in the same tournament,” Sabalenka said.\n“It gives me more confidence. You finish the match and you really just think, ‘When is the next one? I want to go back on court, I want to beat someone.'”\nBriton Watson had little difficulty in beating Australian Fourlis, a victory which moves the 2015 champion into a quarter-final against Donna Vekic, and Alison Riske also advanced after Belgian qualifier Kirsten Flipkens pulled out with a right shoulder injury.\nReporting by Amlan Chakraborty in New Delhi; editing by Peter Rutherford\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-10T09:06:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-10T09:24:44.015+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
