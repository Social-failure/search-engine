The turn of the year is typically a time of reflection and planning to right areas that you may have let go astray in the previous year.\nImplementing a financial plan is our top financial item you should resolve to address in the coming year. This vital item could have a tremendous impact on your financial future, not only for yourself in the coming year but also for generations to come.\nThe coming year should be used to design, develop and implement a financial plan. Think about the amount of time that you spent last year in researching, booking and mapping out your vacation. Was more time spent on planning your vacation or your financial future? I would argue that, in most cases, vacation won this battle.\nThink beyond a budget A financial plan is more than just a budget, reviewing your investment gains/losses or even having a 180-page document that sits on a shelf or in a drawer. Your financial plan should be a living and breathing document. We have met with many clients over the years that have let us know they already have a financial plan, and we ask to review it with them. It is rare that we encounter someone with a plan that was completed recently and/or that they have actually looked at in the last few years. This is not a plan; it is merely a snapshot of their situation at a particular time.\nAdvisors turn to life coaches and counselors", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-02T15:56:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-02T15:27:21.015+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
