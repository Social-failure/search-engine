U.N. Syria envoy Staffan de Mistura has said this meeting should be assessed by its ability to support the U.N.-led Geneva talks on ending the war in Syria, which has been raging for nearly seven years.\nReporting by Rodrigo Campos; Editing by James Dalgleish\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-08T05:11:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-08T05:23:26.002+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
