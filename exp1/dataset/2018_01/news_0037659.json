Germany's .GDAXI DAX was up 0.04 percent, France's .FCHI CAC-40 down 0.11 percent and the UK's FTSE .FTSE unchanged. \nFrench drugmaker Sanofi ( SASY.PA ) fell after the company announced a $11.6 billion takeover of U.S. haemophilia treatment specialist Bioverativ ( BIVV.O ), with some traders saying the deal looked expensive. \nKepler Cheuvreux analysts said the deal raised a “host of questions” and wondered whether Bioverativ’s pipeline could offset pressure from a rival Roche treatment. \nItalian online luxury retailer Yoox Net-a-Porter’s ( YNAP.MI ) shares surged 25 percent, hitting a record after shareholder Richemont ( CFR.S ) moved to buy out the company. \nOcado ( OCDO.L ) jumped 13 percent after it signed an agreement with Sobeys SOBEF.UL to develop the online grocery business at Canada’s second-largest food retailer. \nUBS ( UBSG.S ), Switzerland’s biggest bank, saw its shares fall after posting a quarterly loss, driven by a large writedown on the U.S. tax reforms. UBS still boosted its dividends and announced a new share buyback programme. \nUK betting groups were the worst performers on the STOXX 600, with William Hill ( WMH.L ) and Ladbrokes down 14 percent and 13 percent respectively, on a report that the government is set to cap maximum stakes on fixed-odds betting machines at 2 pounds. \nSouth African retailer Steinhoff ( SNHG.DE ) rose over 11 percent after it said it planned to sell about 7.5 billion rand ($620 million) of shares in investment firm PSG Group it scrambles to plug a liquidity gap.
