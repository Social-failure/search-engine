REUTERS/Stringer \nBeijing has already sought to impose new “special emissions restrictions” on enterprises in major industrial sectors in northern China. \nLiu said China would continue to tackle “scattered” coal-burning sources - a major source of uncontrolled pollution in provinces like Hebei - and would also “steadily” promote clean energy heating. \nAccording to local media reports this week, Hebei was forced to suspend its plans to convert large numbers of coal-fired heating boilers to natural gas after winter supply shortages left thousands of households without heat. \nHowever, Liu denied the reports, telling reporters the Hebei government would “continue to pay close attention” to its coal-to-gas conversion efforts. \nLiu Zhiquan, head of the MEP’s monitoring office, told the briefing that average PM2.5 readings for the whole of China from Jan. 1-28 stood at 64 micrograms per cubic meter, down 20 percent on the year. \nConcentrations in Beijing fell 70.5 percent to 36 micrograms per cubic meter, close to the state standard of 35 micrograms. \nHowever, average readings in the Yangtze and Pearl river deltas, which include Shanghai and Guangzhou respectively, actually increased over the month, he said, without giving details.
