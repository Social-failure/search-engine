So in just a few short, maybe two and a half more years, we'll see the supply go down again to only 900 bitcoins a day.\"\n\"So if you talk about multi-million dollars of inflow with only new supply of 900 bitcoins a day, you can imagine where prices could be at in three, five, or 10 years,\" he added.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-04T02:14:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-04T02:15:00.008+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
