The PKK is considered a terrorist group by the European Union, Turkey and the United States.\nAsked if Syrian rebels would be involved in the operation against Afrin, Erdogan told reporters in parliament: “Of course they will, together. This struggle is being conducted for them. Not for us.”\nSpeaking at a meeting of NATO top brass in Brussels, armed forces chief General Hulusi Akar said Turkey will not allow the YPG to receive support and said NATO should not differentiate between terrorist groups, state-run Anadolu agency reported.\n“We cannot and will not allow support and arming of the YPG terror group under the name of an operational partner. We hope this mistake will be corrected in the shortest time,” Akar was reported as saying.\nRelated Coverage Turkey's Erdogan tells NATO will take all precautions for national security: sources\nTurkish army chief says will not allow support for Syrian Kurdish militia: media\nReporting by Gulsen Solaker; Writing by Daren Butler; Editing by Ali Kucukgocmen\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-01-16T18:13:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-16T12:21:12.011+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
