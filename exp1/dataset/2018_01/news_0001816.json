But it is still around 10 percent down against the dollar since the vote for Brexit.\nAgainst the euro, sterling is still more than 15 percent below its 2016 Brexit referendum day low.\nReporting by Saikat Chatterjee; Additional reporting by Tommy Wilkes; Editing by Jeremy Gaunt\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-01-03T17:20:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-04T21:21:18.022+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
