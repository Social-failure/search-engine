It has become Britain’s costliest financial scandal, forcing banks to pay out 28.8 billion pounds in compensation since January 2011.\nRegulators have set an August 2019 deadline for PPI claims, and Wayman said the FOS was getting ready in case there is a “rush to the finish” with many last-minute complaints.\nGrowth in payday loan complaints was, however, probably the fastest in the FOS workload at present, she said.\nReporting by Huw Jones; Editing by Gareth Jones\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-01-16T01:54:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-16T13:36:19.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
