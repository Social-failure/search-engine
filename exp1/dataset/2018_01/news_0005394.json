Nagasu was second on 213.84. The 18-year-old Karen Chen finished a distant third on 198.59 to likely claim the third spot on the American team for the Pyeongchang Games. \n“I think the sky’s the limit for me,” said 19-year-old Tennell. “I’d been doing clean programs all season so I had a really good base.” January 5, 2018; San Jose, CA, USA; Bradie Tennell performs in the ladies free skate program during the 2018 U.S. Figure Skating Championships at SAP Center.

Slideshow (4 Images) \nThe 24-year-old Nagasu, however, ignited the crowd on Friday with her athletic performance and burst into tears of relief on completing a routine that started with a triple Axel before she received an ovation that lasted more than a minute and embraced coach Tom Zakrajsek as she left the ice. \n“Being left off the team (in 2014) has pushed me to become a stronger skater,” she had said beforehand. “It was a very hard thing to accept.” \nThe championships continue on Saturday as 18-year-old Nathan Chen takes a big lead into the men’s free skate, while the husband-and-wife team of Chris and Alexa Knierim lead heading into the pairs free skate.
