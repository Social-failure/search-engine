Because if we’re not... going to get that then,... we may as well go, just getting out of this thing and going to WTO rules.”\n“My guess is that’s why the prime minister is going to appoint a minister for a no deal Brexit, so he (Barnier) needs to understand that actually this is a serious opinion within the United Kingdom and, boy, it would do actually quite real damage,” Farage said.\nReporting by Christopher Stern, Jan Strupczewski and Philip Blenkinsop\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-08T12:40:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-08T13:58:30.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
