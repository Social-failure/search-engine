That could boost the dollar as companies move money out of local currencies and into dollars. \nApple has $250 billion overseas, and it announced plans to pay taxes of $38 billion on money it holds offshore. \nBank of America equity strategists, in a separate note Thursday, said there is $1.2 trillion overseas cash in non-financial companies, and tech companies and health care are two sectors where there will be a lot of cash returned. Repatriation of foreign profits has been mandated as part of tax reform legislation, and the BofA currency strategist said they expect companies to move sooner rather than later to bring it home. \nTo be sure, some strategists do not see much currency impact because they argue these companies already have this foreign money in dollar-denominated assets.
