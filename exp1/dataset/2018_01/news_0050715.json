The tax overhaul was the party's first major legislative victory since Trump took office in January 2017.\nThe SALT provision will hit many taxpayers in states with high incomes, property values and taxes. These include New York, New Jersey, Connecticut and California, which are all generally Democratic leaning.\nNew Jersey Governor Phil Murphy, a Democrat sworn in earlier this month, said the states' lawsuit against the bill could be filed in a \"matter of a couple weeks.\"\n\"We believe substantively there is a very strong case and the more like-minded states who join us I think the better our shot,\" Murphy said.\nConnecticut Governor Dannel Malloy said the state, along with New Jersey and New York, is in conversations \"offline\" with other states about potential actions against the bill. Cuomo mentioned he had spoken with California Governor Jerry Brown.\nOther states are also mulling options to deal with the impact of the federal bill. Legislation that first surfaced in California, that gives taxpayers a way to avoid the new cap on state and local tax deductions by making charitable donations, has emerged in four more states so far.
