This compares to net income of $1.6 million, or $0.18 per diluted share, in the third quarter of 2017 (3Q17) and $1.3 million, or $0.16 per diluted share, in the fourth quarter of 2016 (4Q16). Pre-tax income for 4Q17 was $3.0 million, which was a 16.4% increase compared to the preceding quarter and a 28.0% increase compared to 4Q16.\nFor the full year 2017 net income was $4.9 million, or $0.57 per diluted share, compared to $5.2 million, or $0.62 per diluted share, in 2016. Pre-tax income for the year increased 18.3% to $10.5 million, compared to $8.8 million, in 2016.\n“The organic expansion in our market along California’s Central Coast and the loan and deposit growth generated as a result of this expansion was a highlight of our 2017 results,” stated Martin E. Plourd, President and Chief Executive Officer. “Total loans increased 16.5% year over year and our above-industry net interest margin fueled our core operating results during the quarter. The strength of the economy in our marketplace continues to sustain and build our community banking franchise with strong on-going demand for our high-service approach to lending, deposit and cash management programs. Our focus in the coming year remains on the local markets and expanding our franchise. We will continue to look for local opportunities to grow while adding long-term shareholder value.”\nFourth Quarter 2017 Financial Highlights\nNet loans increased $11.8 million to $726.2 million at December 31, 2017, compared to $714.4 million three months earlier and increased $102.8 million compared to $623.4 million a year ago. Net income was $449,000, or $.05 per diluted share, net of $1.3 million, or $0.15 per diluted share revaluation of net deferred tax asset. Net interest margin for 2017 was 4.34%. Book value per common share increased to $8.55 at December 31, 2017, compared to $8.07 a year ago. The Bank continues to be well-capitalized per banking regulations with its total capital ratio at 11.31% and Tier 1 leverage ratio at 8.83% at December 31, 2017.\nAs a result of the Tax Cuts and Job Act enacted December 22, 2017, the Company revalued its deferred tax assets and liabilities to account for the decrease in the federal corporate rate to 21%. The Company recorded a one-time net tax charge of $1.3 million, or $0.15 per share. This increase in income tax expense was reflected in Community West’s operating results for the fourth quarter of 2017 and was in addition to the normal provision for income tax related to pre-tax net operating income.\nIncome Statement\n“Our net interest margin remained stable during the quarter and remains well-above industry averages, despite compression compared to the fourth quarter of 2016,” said Susan C. Thompson, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Fourth quarter net interest margin was 4.26% compared to 4.27% in 3Q17 and 4.63% in 4Q16. For all of 2017, Community West’s net interest margin was 4.34% compared to 4.60% in 2016 which included eight basis points of asset yields attributable to one large past due relationship which paid in full.\nNet interest income for 4Q17 was $8.5 million, a 1.2% increase compared to $8.4 million in the preceding quarter and a 9.2% increase compared to $7.8 million in 4Q16. For the year, net interest income increased 12.3% to $32.7 million compared to $29.1 million in 2016. Non-interest income increased 25.1% to $896,000 in 4Q17, compared to $716,000 in 3Q17 and increased 66.5% compared to $538,000 in 4Q16. For the year, non-interest income increased 30.9% to $3.0 million compared to $2.3 million in 2016.\nNon-interest expenses totaled $6.4 million in 4Q17, which were unchanged compared to the preceding quarter. Non-interest expenses totaled $5.9 million in 4Q16. For the year, non-interest expenses were $24.7 million compared to $22.5 million in 2016. The increase was largely due to costs associated with the expansion of the Bank’s Northern and Southern regions.\nBalance Sheet\n“Loan growth was robust during the quarter, fueled by our strong local economy,” said Plourd. “We continue to see strong loan demand in our local markets, with loan originations totaling $38.2 million during the quarter.”\nNet loans increased 1.7% to $726.2 million at December 31, 2017, compared to $714.4 million at September 30, 2017, and increased $102.8 million, or 16.5% compared to $623.4 million a year ago. Commercial real estate loans outstanding were up 30.3% from year ago levels to $354.6 million at December 31, 2017, and comprise 48.3% of the total loan portfolio.

Core deposits, defined as non-interest-bearing checking, interest-bearing checking, money market accounts, savings accounts and retail certificates of deposit totaled $452.2 million at December 31, 2017 and comprise 64.6% of total deposits.\nTotal assets were $833.3 million at December 31, 2017, a $4.2 million increase compared to three months earlier and a $122.7 million, or 17.3% increase compared to $710.6 million one year ago. Stockholders’ equity improved to $70.1 million at December 31, 2017, compared to $69.8 million at September 30, 2017, and $65.3 million a year ago. Book value per common share improved to $8.55 at December 31, 2017, compared to $8.54 at September 30, 2017, and $8.07 a year ago.\nCredit Quality\n“Due to another quarter of net credit recovery, we recorded a negative provision for loan losses of $12,000 in the fourth quarter,” added Plourd. The provision for loan losses was $159,000 in 3Q17, and $116,000 in 4Q16. For the year, the provision for loan losses was $411,000, compared to a net provision credit of $48,000 in 2016. Net loan recoveries were $120,000 in 4Q17 compared to $159,000 in 3Q17 and $158,000 in 4Q16.\nThe allowance for loan losses was $8.4 million at December 31, 2017, or 1.24% of total loans held for investment, compared to 1.25% at September 30, 2017, and 1.31% a year ago. Net nonaccrual loans were $4.5 million, or 0.61% of total loans at December 31, 2017, compared to $1.8 million, or 0.25% of total loans, three months earlier, and to $2.4 million, or 0.38% of total loans, a year ago. The increase in nonaccrual loans was primarily in the commercial loan segment.\nOf the $4.5 million in net nonaccrual loans, $2.6 million were commercial loans, $565,000 were commercial agricultural loans, $418,000 were manufactured housing loans, $214,000 were home equity loans, $184,000 were SBA 504 1st loans, $176,000 were single-family real estate loans, $170,000 were SBA 7A loans and $122,000 were commercial real estate loans.\nOther assets acquired through foreclosure totaled $372,000 at December 31, 2017, compared to $486,000 three months earlier and $137,000 a year earlier.
