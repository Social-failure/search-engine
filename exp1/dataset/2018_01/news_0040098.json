REUTERS/Giorgio Perottino/File Photo Intesa held 54 billion euros ($66 billion) in gross impaired debts at the end of September, or 13.7 percent of its overall loans.\nThe European Central Bank in October proposed tougher rules on new loans turning sour and said it may also review its position on the stock of existing bad debts.\nThese proposals triggered complaints in Italy, home to a quarter of the euro zone’s bad loans, with politicians and lenders saying they could hurt economic growth and discourage lending.\nMessina said that it would be difficult were the ECB to apply new rules on existing bad loans but more likely that tougher regulation would be taken with regards to bad loan inflows.\n“In any case, for Intesa Sanpaolo it is not important,” Messina said.\nWhen asked about possible M&A in the asset gathering business, Messina said Intesa Sanpaolo had significant potential to grow its asset management business internally.\nReporting by Silvia Alosi; writing by Francesca Landini; Editing by Keith Weir\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-01-23T19:24:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-24T15:18:25.001+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
