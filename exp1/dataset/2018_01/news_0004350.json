He said it appeared the rally would not come and it would be sign of things to come in the new year.\n\"We were thinking we were going to have to put Santa's face on a milk carton and that the year was not going to be bright,\" Cashin said on \" Squawk on the Street .\"\n\"New money for the new year kept pouring in,\" Cashin continued, \"[and] seems to keep pouring in today.\"\nThe market's run higher could also set up an additional rally, Cashin predicted.\n\"We've had a series of years in which we had an outstanding thing like a 20 percent rise.
