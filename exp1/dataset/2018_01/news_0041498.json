The 2G, the network in operation in Gaza, allows calls and limited data transmission.\nAker said some $40 million was invested in building a 3G infrastructure for the West Bank that includes 1,000 new cell towers. Jawwal says it has three million customers in Gaza and the West Bank, and Wataniya says it has 800,000.\nIsrael, where 3G networks went into service in 2004, withheld frequencies for the Palestinians for nearly 12 years. In November 2015, it agreed to allow 3G in the West Bank alone and not in Gaza, an enclave dominated by the Hamas Islamist group that advocates Israel’s destruction.\nUnder interim peace deals, Israel has final say in allocating radio frequencies in the Palestinian territories.\nThe World Bank report said that Israel has pointed to security concerns in imposing cellular spectrum and equipment importing restrictions on the Palestinians.\nJawwal’s general manager, Abdul Majeed Melhem, said Israeli approval of a 3G Palestinian network in the West Bank came only after Israeli cellular providers upgraded to 4G in 2014, which kept them a step ahead of the competition.\nAdditional reporting by Nidal al-Mughrabi in Gaza, Writing by Jeffrey Heller, Editing by Angus MacSwan\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-01-24T20:33:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-25T13:08:04.010+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
