Slideshow (9 Images) \nA masterful performance was blighted only by a late wobble, when Nadal was broken serving for the match at 5-4 in the decider. \nBut the Spaniard found an extra gear in the tiebreak, wrapping up the match with a monster serve to the corner that Mayer battled to get a racket to. \nNadalâ€™s bid for a 17th grand slam title continues against Bosnian 28th seed Damir Dzumhur.
