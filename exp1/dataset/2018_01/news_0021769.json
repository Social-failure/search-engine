The Rio de Janeiro-based company did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\nIn a separate case, federal prosecutors recommended the suspension of Vale’s dredging operations in the Sepetiba Bay in Rio de Janeiro state after a virus killed 200 gray porpoises.\nVale said it had not been officially informed about the recommendation. It said in a statement that all its operations in the bay where it has a terminal are duly licensed and monitored by the authorities.\nReporting by Luciano Costa, writing by Anthony Boadle; Editing by Lisa Shumaker\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-16T00:07:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-16T00:28:41.003+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
