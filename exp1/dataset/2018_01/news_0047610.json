Demand is still good, especially from the construction sector,” said analyst Casper Burgering at ABN Amro in Amsterdam.\nAdditional reporting by Swati Verma in Bengaluru, editing by David Evans\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-01-25T21:11:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-26T21:28:46.014+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
