RISK REDUCTION \nAsked about when EDIS would be introduced, Altmaier said: “We first must reduce risks before there can be risk sharing. Therefore, from our point of view and from today’s perspective, there cannot be a fixed date.” \nIn a speech at the Finance Ministry shortly after the news conference with Altmaier, Centeno said that in addition to the banking union, the bloc should have a “fiscal capacity” which would help countries tackle crises not of their own making. \n“This process does not need to come with a cost for domestic insurance schemes, but needs to be seen in a complementary way.” he said, seeking to assuage German fears. \n“I believe a first step of a long, step-by-step, controlled process will be enough to generate a new wave of confidence in the markets.” \nHe added: “To be clear: a common fiscal capacity does not entail permanent transfers – there are no proposals aiming at that. And it has to be designed in a way to avoid moral hazard”. \nAltmaier will also discuss how to improve governance of the 19-member single currency bloc with his French counterpart, Bruno Le Maire, on Thursday in Paris. \nMerkel will meet IMF chief Christine Lagarde on Friday in Berlin before travelling to Paris where she is expected to discuss euro zone reforms with Macron. \nMerkel’s conservatives and the SPD last week agreed on the blueprint for a governing coalition. \nThe draft raised the prospect of an “investment budget” for the single currency bloc, a nod to Macron’s call for a budget to help the euro zone cope with external economic shocks. \nIt also calls for the ESM bailout mechanism to be turned into a full-blown European Monetary Fund under parliamentary control and anchored in EU law. \nSPD delegates will vote on Sunday on whether party leaders should proceed to formal negotiations with the conservatives on forming a coalition government that will secure Merkel a fourth term.
