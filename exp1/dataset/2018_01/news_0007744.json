The diesel engine will be manufactured at a Ford plant in Britain.\nFord executives said they expect that once production ramps up about 5 percent of F-150 models will be ordered with the diesel engine. The model will be aimed at people who tow large recreational or work trailers.\nSales of big pickup trucks in the United States have surged in recent years as gasoline prices have stabilized at less than $3 a gallon in most states. Ford in 2017 sold 896,764 F-series trucks, more than in any year since 2005.\nStill, Ford, General Motors Co ( GM.N ) and the Ram brand of Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV ( FCAU.N ) ( FCHA.MI ) fight for the right to claim that their brands offer the most fuel-efficient large pickup - even when those high-mileage models have limited availability or cost more than conventional gasoline-fueled trucks.\nFiat Chrysler jarred its rivals in 2013 by offering a diesel engine in its light duty Ram pickup models and claiming best-in-class fuel economy. But last year, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and the U.S. Justice Department charged that Fiat Chrysler improperly used software to cheat government emissions tests covering 104,000 Ram 2014-2016 models.\nThe automaker is negotiating to settle the complaints and received government clearance to offer a 3.0 liter diesel in its 2017 and 2018 Ram trucks. That model is rated at 27 miles per gallon in highway driving.\nFord executives said they are confident their diesel will comply with U.S. emissions rules. Owners will need to refill a 5.4 gallon tank of fluid for the exhaust treatment system roughly every 10,000 miles, Filipe said.\nReporting By Joseph White; Editing by Bill Trott\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-08T08:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-08T08:14:10.012+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
