Prior to that he led the English Football Association (FA). \nWhitbread, which has been the subject of break-up speculation in the past, warned in April of a tougher consumer environment, as rising inflation and muted wage growth weighed on consumer spending. \nLast month, U.S.-based hedge fund Sachem Head Capital Management declared a 3.4 percent stake in the British hotel and coffee chain operator. \nSachem Head has previously taken activist positions at companies, though it is unclear whether it will push for changes at FTSE 100 .FTSE listed Whitbread.
