Most countries consider as illegal the Israeli settlements built in the territory which Israel captured in the 1967 Middle East war.\nIsrael disputes that its settlements are illegal and says their future should be determined in peace talks with the Palestinians.\nIsraeli authorities were due to approve on Wednesday the construction of 1,285 housing units to be built in 2018 and advance planning for 2,500 others in about 20 different settlements, Lieberman said in a statement.\nIsrael's Defence Minister Avigdor Lieberman speaks during the International Institute for Counter Terrorism's 17th annual conference in Herzliya, Israel September 11, 2017.
