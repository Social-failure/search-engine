(TSX Venture: SCR) (\"theScore\") today announced the financial results for the three months ended November 30, 2017 in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (\"IFRS\").\nIn Q1 F2018 the Company achieved the first EBITDA positive quarter in its history. EBITDA was $0.5M, versus a loss of $0.4M for the same period the previous year.\n\"After previously forecasting that we would be EBITDA positive in F2018, we are very pleased to get this fiscal year off to a strong start, something which puts a solid foundation in place for the rest of the year,\" said John Levy, CEO and Founder of theScore.\nThe Company achieved revenue of $8.4M for Q1 F2018 versus $8.5M for the same period the previous year. Increased US programmatic revenue and Canadian direct sales revenue was offset by lower direct sales in the US.\nAverage monthly active users of theScore app* for Q1 F2018 were 4.3M versus 4.4M for the same period the previous year, while average monthly app sessions-per-user were 103 versus 102 for Q1 F2017.\ntheScore app on iOS showed positive momentum this quarter, breaking new single-month user records in both October and November. For Q1 F2018, monthly active users of theScore app on iPhone and iPad were up by 6% for the same period the previous year. Monthly active users of theScore app on Android were down by 11% over the previous year.\n\"Following the launch of our newly designed flagship app at the end of Q4, we've seen some extremely encouraging growth on our iOS platforms, twice breaking records for users in a single month in Q1,\" said Mr. Levy. \"While the change in Android users is reflective of trends we've seen with other apps in the free sports category in Google Play over the past year, we believe a combination of product and marketing initiatives will enable us to tackle this platform-specific challenge head-on by improving both user acquisition and retention.\n\"Our priority now is building on this momentum through the continued improvement of our offering through ongoing experimentation and maintaining our regular bi-weekly release cycles to get updates into the hands of sports fans as quickly as possible.\"\ntheScore's esports team also reinforced its focus on the creation of original video content during Q1 F2018, doubling-down on the production of successful video franchises which regularly generate six-figure viewing figures across YouTube, Facebook and other social platforms. In Q1 F2018, theScore esports recorded a total of 18M video views, up from 3.5M for the same period the previous year.\ntheScore's Emerging Platforms team continued to work on developing for new platforms and technologies to further amplify theScore brand and product offering. In Q1 F2018, theScore launched its Skill for Amazon Alexa across North America, continued to grow and improve its chatbot for Facebook Messenger and, only last week, launched the first-ever fantasy sports game for Facebook's Instant Games platform on Messenger.\n\"We continue to be encouraged by the growth potential we're seeing with our esports video and emerging platforms initiatives, with the recent launch of our pioneering fantasy sports game on Instant Games being a prime example,\" said Mr. Levy. \"This, combined with the strong reach of more than 30M people a month across our social platforms, enables us to focus on our core app business while also looking to the future to ensure theScore stays one step ahead of the ever-evolving demands of sports fans.\"\ntheScore announced that, if the proposed amendments to its stock option plan are approved by shareholders at today's annual and special meeting, the board of directors intends to grant today 9,940,000 options to acquire Class A subordinate voting shares to employees of the Company, including 1,660,000 options to directors and officers of the Company.
