The euro was down 0.14 percent to $1.222. \nEuropean shares closed higher as confidence grew about corporate earnings and the strength of the global economy. The euro zone’s STOXX benchmark index closed up 0.73 percent at 402.95 points, its highest level in 10 years and the pan-regional STOXX 600 benchmark rose 0.5 percent to 400.71 points, a 2-1/2 year peak. \nThe pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index rose 0.49 percent, also a 2-1/2 year high, and MSCI’s gauge of stocks across the globe gained 0.46 percent. MSCI’s index notched its ninth straight week of gains. \nYields on the 10-year U.S. government note hit a three-year high as weakness in overnight trading led the debt to test key technical support levels, before the higher yields attracted new buyers. \nThe benchmark 10-year yield hit its highest level since September 2014 at 2.646 percent, breaking the 2017 high of 2.64 percent the market had been flirting with all week. \nBenchmark 10-year notes last fell 12/32 in price to yield 2.6555 percent, from 2.611 percent late on Thursday. \nOil prices retreated and snapped a four-week streak of gains, as a bounce-back in U.S. production outweighed ongoing declines in crude inventories. \nU.S. crude settled down 0.9 percent at $63.37 per barrel and Brent was last at $68.61, down 1 percent on the day.
