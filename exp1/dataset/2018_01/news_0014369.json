Bush usually began his time in the Oval Office around 6:45 a.m., and Barack Obama typically arrived between 9 a.m. and 10 a.m.\nWhite House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders responded to the Axios report, saying, \"The time in the morning is a mix of residence time and Oval Office time but he always has calls with staff, Hill members, Cabinet members and foreign leaders during this time.\"\nFor more details on the president's schedule — and his TV habits — see the full report from Axios.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-08T01:20:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-08T01:20:39.002+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
