For the year ending December 31, 2017, net income was $7.9 million, or $1.85 per diluted share, compared with $5.0 million, or $1.55 per diluted share, for the same period, last year. Fourth quarter and full year 2017 results were impacted by a $1.8 million charge, or $0.43 per diluted share, to adjust deferred taxes due to the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.\nTable 1 (Dollars in thousands, except per share data, unaudited) 4th Qtr '17 4th Qtr '16 FY 2017 FY 2016 Interest income $ 11,241 $ 10,617 $ 43,385 $ 29,179 Interest expense 1,593 1,206 5,720 3,324 Net interest income 9,648 9,411 37,665 25,855 Provision for credit losses 375 100 1,660 730 Non-interest income 1,419 1,279 5,418 6,364 Non-interest expenses 7,202 7,347 28,021 24,641 Income before income taxes 3,490 3,243 13,402 6,848 Income tax expense 2,682 930 5,456 1,869 Net income $ 808 $ 2,313 $ 7,946 $ 4,979 Net income per share, diluted $ 0.19 $ 0.55 $ 1.85 $ 1.55 Table 2: The following table reconciles adjusted earnings per share, net income and return ratios.

DNB believes adjusted net income, earnings per share, ROAA and ROAE provide a greater understanding of ongoing operations and enhances comparability of results with prior periods.\nDNB is the parent of DNB First, National Association, one of the first nationally-chartered community banks to serve the greater Philadelphia region. On October 1, 2016, the Company completed its acquisition of Philadelphia-based East River Bank (\"East River\") and its results of operations are included in the consolidated results for the periods ended December 31, 2016, March 31, 2017, June 30, 2017, September 30, 2017 and December 31, 2017, but are not included in the results of operations for any other periods.\nWilliam J. Hieb, President and CEO, commented, “Strong fourth quarter results help to define 2017 as a year in which significant progress was made to strengthen our banking franchise. We are well-positioned and excited about our growth prospects in the attractive markets of Greater Philadelphia.” Mr. Hieb added, “We remain focused on providing the superior service that our customers and the community have come to expect from DNB Financial.”\nHighlights\nThe net interest margin was 3.74% for the quarter ending December 31, 2017, compared with 3.72% for the previous quarter and 3.63% for the three months ending December 31, 2016.\nAsset quality remained strong as net charge-offs were only 0.06% (annualized) of total average loans for the fourth quarter of 2017. Non-performing loans were 0.89% of total loans at December 31, 2017.\nTotal loans increased 3.1% (not annualized) on a sequential quarter basis and 3.5% since December 31, 2016. At year-end, 2017, the loan-to-deposit ratio was 98%.\nWealth management assets under care increased 18.0% to $252.8 million as of December, 31, 2017, from $214.2 million as of December 31, 2016. Wealth management fees represented approximately 32% of total fee income for the year ended December 31, 2017.\nThe Company paid a quarterly cash dividend of $0.07 per share on December 13, 2017.\nIncome Statement Summary\nResults for the fourth quarter and year ending December 31, 2017, included an adjustment to income tax expense of $1.8 million, or $0.43 per diluted share, related to a reduction in the carrying value of the net deferred tax asset. This fourth quarter adjustment was recognized due to the enactment of The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act on December 22, 2017. While the Company’s earnings, beginning in 2018, are expected to benefit from the lower corporate income tax rates, companies are required to revalue their deferred tax positions at December 31, 2017 at the lower federal income tax rates.\nReported net income of $808,000 for the fourth quarter of 2017 generated a return on average assets (“ROAA”) and return on average equity (“ROAE”) of 0.30% and 3.1%, respectively. On an adjusted basis, the ROAA and ROAE were 0.98% and 10.2%, respectively. Please see Tables 1 and 2.\nNet interest income for the three months ending December 31, 2017 was $9.6 million, which represented a $142,000 increase from the quarter ending September 30, 2017, and a $237,000 increase from the quarter ending December 31, 2016. The year-over-year increase was primarily due to an $11.8 million, or 1.4%, rise in total average loans and an 11 basis point increase in the reported net interest margin to 3.74% for the quarter ending December 31, 2017.\nTotal interest expense was $1.6 million for the three months ending December 31, 2017, compared with $1.5 million for the quarter ending September 30, 2017, and $1.2 million for the fourth quarter of 2016. The weighted average rate paid for interest-bearing liabilities was 0.66%, 0.61% and 0.49% for the quarters ending December 31, 2017, September 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016, respectively. The rise in the weighted average rate was primarily due to an overall increase in market interest rates.\nThe provision for credit losses was $375,000 for both the third and fourth quarters of 2017, compared with $100,000 for the three months ended December 31, 2016. As of December 31, 2017, the allowance for credit losses was $5.8 million and represented 0.69% of total loans. Loans acquired in connection with the purchase of East River were recorded at fair value based on an initial estimate of expected cash flows, including a reduction for estimated credit losses, and without carryover of the respective portfolio's historical allowance for credit losses. At December 31, 2017, the allowance for credit losses as a percentage of originated loans, which represents all loans other than those acquired, was 1.0%.\nTotal non-interest income for the fourth quarter of 2017 was $1.4 million, compared with $1.3 million for the same quarter, last year. Wealth management fees were $456,000 for the fourth quarter of 2017, compared with $411,000 for the third quarter of 2017, and $404,000 for the fourth quarter of 2016. Wealth management fees represented approximately 32% of total fee income for the year ended December 31, 2017.\nNon-interest expense was $7.2 million for the fourth quarter of 2017, compared with $7.0 million for the third quarter of 2017, and $7.3 million for the quarter ending December 31, 2016. Non-interest expense for the quarter ending December 31, 2016, included merger-related costs of $280,000 and $480,000 for the write-down of OREO property to its net realizable value. Excluding merger-related and other one-time costs, year-over-year increases were largely due to additional expenses related to staff, offices and equipment and professional and consulting fees.\nBalance Sheet Summary\nAs of December 31, 2017, total assets were $1.1 billion, which was relatively unchanged from year-end, 2016. Total annual loan growth of $28.4 million, or 3.5%, was partially offset by an $8.0 million, or 4.4% decline in investment securities and an $11.2 million, or 50.6%, decrease in cash and cash equivalents. Total deposits decreased $24.0 million, or 2.7%. As of December 31, 2017, total stockholders’ equity was $101.9 million, compared with $94.8 million as of December 31, 2016. Tangible book value per share was $20.06 as of December 31, 2017, compared with $18.56 as of December 31, 2016.\nOn a sequential quarter basis, total loans increased $26.1 million, or 3.1% (not annualized), to $845.9 million as of December 31, 2017 and were 78.2% of total assets. Over the past 12 months, the Company’s commercial mortgage lending portfolio increased $19.4 million, or 4.2%, commercial business loans grew $6.4 million, or 5.2%, and commercial construction loans increased $2.3 million, or 3.1%. At December 31, 2017, commercial loans totaled $689.4 million and were 81.5% of total loans.\nOn a sequential quarter basis, total core deposits decreased $13.8 million, or 2.0% (not annualized), and were 78.8% of total deposits as of December 31, 2017. As of the same date, noninterest-bearing deposits were 20.5% of total deposits and the loan-to-deposit ratio was 98.2%.\nCapital ratios continue to exceed all regulatory standards for well-capitalized institutions. As of December 31, 2017, the Tier 1 leverage ratio was 9.19%, the Tier 1 risk-based capital was 11.80%, the common equity Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio was 10.71% and the total risk based capital ratio was 13.73%. As of the same date, the tangible common equity-to-tangible assets ratio was 8.07%. Intangible assets and goodwill totaled $16.1 million as of December 31, 2017.\nAsset Quality Summary\nAsset quality remained strong as net charge-offs were 0.06% of total average loans for the quarter ending December 31, 2017, and 0.15% for the year ending December 31, 2017. Total non-performing assets, including loans and other real estate property, were $12.6 million as of December 31, 2017 compared with $12.0 million as of September 30, 2017, and $11.3 million as of December 31, 2016. The ratio of non-performing loans to total loans was 0.89% as of December 31, 2017, versus 1.04% as of December 31, 2016.\nInterest Rate Risk Management\nDNB's strategy has been to seek shorter duration over yield in its lending and investing activities and lengthen duration over rate in its financing activities to minimize interest rate risk. The Company also strives to offer products and services that develop strong relationships to retain core deposits. The Bank has an Asset Liability Management Committee that actively monitors and manages the Bank's interest rate exposure using simulation models and gap analysis. The Committee's primary objective is to minimize the adverse impact of changes in interest rates on net interest income, while maximizing earnings. Simulation model results show moderate liability sensitivity to rising rates in 100, 200, 300 and 400 basis point shock scenarios. Rate changes ramped in over 24 months also show moderate liability sensitivity.\nGeneral Information\nDNB Financial Corporation is a bank holding company whose bank subsidiary, DNB First, National Association, is a community bank headquartered in Downingtown, Pennsylvania with 15 locations.
