Federal law prohibits Medicaid or any other federal funding for abortion services.\nThe move is the Trump administration's latest effort to roll back policies developed under former President Barack Obama.\n\"You are watching a struggle over abortion politics,\" said Robin Wilson, a professor at University of Illinois College of Law. \"In a sense you're allowing state Medicaid regulators, through regulation, to reopen a whole can of worms around womens health.\"\nWilson said the impact could be immediate in states which, before the Obama-era guidance, had been working to effectively defund or limit funding to providers such as Planned Parenthood, which provide abortions but bill them separately so that they are not paid for by Medicaid.\nDawn Laguens, executive vice president for the Planned Parenthood Action Fund, said the move encourages states to block access to care at Planned Parenthood.\n\"The law is clear: it is illegal to bar women from seeking care at Planned Parenthood. Longstanding protections within Medicaid safeguard every person's right to access care at their qualified provider of choice,\" Laguens said in a statement.\nNEW RULE\nThe rule will enforce statutes that guarantee these civil rights. Roger Severino, director of the Office of Civil Rights at HHS, said the office had received 34 complaints since Trump took office last January.\nExperts on Thursday said the move to protect workers on religious grounds raised the possibility it could provide legal cover for otherwise unlawful discrimination, and encourage a broader range of religious objections.
