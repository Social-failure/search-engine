It rose 30.9 percent Thursday, to top $12,000 after plunging more than 30 percent earlier in the week. Other cryptocurrencies such as ripple , litecoin and ethereum , showed similar trading patterns. Bitcoin was trading around $11,570 later Thursday. \nOn CNBC's \" Fast Money \" on Thursday, Bogart said while many of the smaller digital currencies seem overpriced these days, which is \"not a sign of a discerning market,\" bitcoin has demonstrated its ability to survive upheaval. \n\"There's a legion of people out there right now that see this as a great buying opportunity,\" he said. \nLater on \"Fast Money,\" Eliot Spitzer, former New York governor and attorney general, said he wants to make sure people understand what it is they own and are buying, but he doesn't own a single bitcoin. Volatility this extreme means there is something that isn't tied to intrinsic value. \"I don't get it,\" he said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-19T01:16:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-19T01:31:11.022+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
