The listing is expected to take place in the first half of 2018 and possibly as early as the first quarter, one of the sources said. \nCIBC is working with Barclays and UBS to advise it on the potential listing, three of the sources said. \nCIBC declined to comment on Thursday. Sources declined to be identified as the information is not public. \nThe bank said in December it was considering a listing of FirstCaribbean in the United States but had yet to make a decision.
