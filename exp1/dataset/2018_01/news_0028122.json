But bipartisan congressional negotiations with the White House faltered last week, prompting Republican leaders to begin pushing for the passage of a stopgap measure to fund the government through Feb. 16.\nThe White House said on Wednesday it supported the passage of a short-term funding measure and that immigration talks could resume next week.\n“We do support the short-term CR,” White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders told reporters, referring to the so-called continuing resolution.\n“Let’s make a budget deal by Friday and let’s come back to work aggressively on Monday and make a deal on DACA and responsible immigration reform,” Sanders added.\nRepublicans hold a slim 51-49 majority in the Senate and most legislation, including spending bills or an immigration deal, will require 60 votes for passage.\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said the Senate would take up the short-term funding measure as soon as the House approves it.\nBut Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer said on Wednesday that there was “revulsion” among his colleagues for the stopgap proposal in the House and that an “overwhelming number” would not support it.\nAt least one Republican, Senator Lindsey Graham, who is involved in the immigration negotiations, has also said he would not vote for a short-term funding measure.\nIt was also unclear whether Republicans would have the votes in the House to pass a short-term fix given that members of the conservative House Freedom Caucus would prefer additional defense funding.\nThe group’s leader, Representative Mark Meadows, said on Wednesday evening that while his members disliked the deal, the chances for a shutdown “are very unlikely because no one wants one.” (Additional reporting by Susan Cornwell; Editing by Peter Cooney; Writing by Amanda Becker)\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-01-18T19:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-19T12:30:33.004+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
