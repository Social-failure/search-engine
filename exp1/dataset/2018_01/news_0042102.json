Output in China reached 831.7 million tonnes, up 5.7 percent versus 2016.\nIn the months ahead however, output in China is expected to fall as Beijing has ordered steel mills to cut production from mid-November to mid-March to help clear the country’s skies.\nAccording to Reuters calculations based on official Chinese data, average daily steel output declined 1.9 percent to 2.16 million tonnes in December from 2.205 million tonnes in November.\nCapacity utilisation rates at mills around the world hit 69.5 percent in December, according to worldsteel, up 1.8 percentage points from 2016, thanks largely to steelmaking capacity cuts in China.\nBeijing has cut 115 million tonnes of legal capacity and 120 million tonnes of illegal capacity since the start of 2016, helping drive up steel prices in China and the world.\nThe steel industry, worth about $900 billion a year, is a gauge of the world’s economic health.\nReporting by Maytaal Angel, editing by David Evans\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-01-25T01:59:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-25T13:04:23.009+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
