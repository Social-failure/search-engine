Japan added $3.2 billion, Europe continued to reverse December outflows, adding $2.2 billion, while emerging markets raked in $4.3 billion.\nThe bullish mood has however sent BAML’s risk indicator shooting to 7.1 from 6.2, which the bank said was nearing a sell signal. But it suggested investors “stay long risk assets until sentiment reaches euphoric territory of 8.0.”\nThey added: “Peak positioning on its way but we expect asset prices to overshoot first.” (Reporting by Karin Strohecker; editing by John Stonestreet)\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-12T14:12:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-12T14:28:17.021+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
