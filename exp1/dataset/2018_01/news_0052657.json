Revenue rose marginally to $13.70 billion.\nAnalysts on average were expecting a profit of 56 cents per share and revenue of $13.68 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.\nPrevnar raked in sales of $1.53 billion, up 8.3 percent from the year-ago quarter, while Xeljanz jumped 47.5 percent to $410 million. Both the drugs significantly beat consensus estimates, compiled by Barclays.\nHowever, sales of the company’s breast cancer treatment, Ibrance, rose 11.4 percent to $716 million, but missed estimates of $978 million.\nPfizer forecast full-year adjusted earnings per share of between $2.90 and $3 and revenue of $53.5 billion to $55.5 billion.\nAnalysts on average were expecting a profit of $2.78 per share and revenue of $53.88 billion.\nReporting by Divya Grover in Bengaluru; Additional reoirting by Michael Erman in New York; Editing by Sriraj Kalluvila\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-30T14:33:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-30T14:46:44.003+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
