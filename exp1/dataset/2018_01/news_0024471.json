Many of those funds track sector-specific indexes and could be affected by the GICS changes.\nS&P Dow Jones Indices and MSCI said in November 2017 that they were planning changes to the categories and that they would be implemented after the close of business on Sept. 28, 2018.\nThe updates are meant to reflect changes to industries resulting from technology and acquisitions.\nAlso moving to the newly named Communications Sector are Twitter Inc and Snap Inc, both currently part of the Information Technology Sector.\nWalt Disney Co and DISH Network Corp, both currently in the Consumer Discretionary Sector, will also join the Communications Sector.\nComcast and Netflix currently fall under the Consumer Discretionary Sector.
