The strategy is paying off, with the currency losing nearly 9 percent versus the euro last year. \nThe central bank’s profit was also boosted by buoyant global stock markets. Around 20 percent of its investments are in shares of companies including big stakes in Amazon, Starbucks and Facebook. \nMaking a profit is not part of the SNB’s mandate, which aims to ensure price stability in Switzerland while paying attention to the country’s economic development. The record profit does not mean a bigger payout for the bank’s 2,200 shareholders. The SNB stuck to a proposed payout of 15 francs per share - the maximum allowed under Swiss law. \nThe SNB is unusual among central banks in having private shareholders, although most of its shares are held by cantonal banks and the country’s cantons. Its stock price more than doubled last year. \n“The SNB’s dividend may seem quite low when compared to its profits, but the bank was not created to make a profit. It is just a nice side effect,” said Alessandro Bee, an economist at UBS. \nBut the Swiss federal government and the country’s 26 cantons will get more cash than usual. \nIn addition to the normal 1 billion francs payout they get, they will share an extra 1 billion francs after the SNB’s distribution reserve exceeded 20 billion francs. \nCredit Suisse said the result would help the SNB to defend its expansive monetary policy, which has featured regular currency market interventions to weaken the franc. \n“A large profit makes it easier for the SNB to explain why it has built up all these foreign currency reserves than if they reported a loss,” said economist Maxime Botteron. $1 = 0.9773 Swiss francs Editing by Michael Shields", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-09T09:18:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-09T09:55:10.024+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
