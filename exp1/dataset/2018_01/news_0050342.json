HNA faces rising financing costs after a $50 billion acquisition spree over the past two years.\nHNA Technology Investments, valued at HK$959 million ($122.68 million), recorded a net loss of HK$18.5 million in 2016. It said in a statement the turnaround was primarily attributable to the improvements in its sales and gross profit of its smart card products operation.\n$1 = 7.8171 Hong Kong dollars Reporting by Clare Jim; Editing by Jane Merriman\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-01-28T19:55:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-29T21:58:29.005+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
