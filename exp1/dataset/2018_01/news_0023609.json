( 7201.T ) plans to transform its upscale Infiniti brand of vehicles into a primarily electrified offering, Chief Executive Hiroto Saikawa said on Tuesday.\nAll new Infiniti models launched from 2021 will be either electric or so-called “e-Power” hybrids, Saikawa told the Automotive News World Congress in Detroit.\nThe announcement revives plans for a luxury electric offering that Nissan first touted with a 2012 Infiniti show car, but later scrapped over profitability concerns. That left the road clear for Tesla’s ( TSLA.O ) Model S, introduced the same year.\n“We are going to make Infiniti the premium and highly electrified brand,” Saikawa said on Tuesday.\nNissan and alliance partner Renault ( RENA.PA ) took an early lead in battery-powered cars with models such as the 2011 Leaf, still the world’s top-selling electric vehicle.\nHowever, Tesla has hogged the limelight in recent years, while German carmakers are leading a $90 billion wave of investment in electric and plug-in hybrid cars.\nNissan dropped the earlier electric Infiniti program in mid-2014 over concerns it would threaten the financial goals in its “Power 88” mid-term plan, according to people involved in those discussions. The company ended up missing its 8 percent margin target anyway, in fiscal 2017.\nNissan is one of a number of Japanese carmakers seeking to jump-start a higher-end brand. Toyota ( 7203.T ) is launching a revamped Lexus LS flagship, while Honda ( 7267.T ) has been redesigning its Acura line in the hope of boosting sales.\nIn the United States, Infiniti’s sales rose 11.3 percent last year in a light vehicle market that was down 1.5 percent overall, while Acura deliveries fell by 3.9 percent and Lexus by 7.6 percent.\nReporting by Laurence Frost and Naomi Tajitsu; Editing by Sandra Maler and Rosalba O'Brien\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-17T00:24:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-17T00:33:02.010+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
