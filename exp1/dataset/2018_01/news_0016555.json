To that point, to the -Nth degree. That ruined, absolutely ruined, the experience for me.” \nDespite taking an additional silver in Sochi for the team competition, Chan subsequently sat out the next season before a comeback in 2015-2016. \nA three-time world champion, Chan is known for his artistry in an era of ever-increasing quad jumps, a trend he has regarded with caution amid concerns about skater safety. \nIn the 2017 world championships in Helsinki, Chan landed three quadruple jumps in his free program for the first time, but still only finished fourth, with each of the podium finishers, Japanese duo Yuzuru Hanyu and Shoma Uno, and China’s Jin Boyang, landing four.

It’s motivating, you want to try it,” Chan said. \n“But I have to constantly remind myself that my plan is completely different. I‘m at a different point, my approach to competition and my prep is completely different.” \nStill, at October’s Skate Canada Chan finished a disappointing fourth after scaling back the difficulty of his routine and even then falling on his opening quadruple toeloop. \nHe then skipped the next Grand Prix event to focus on training. \n“Clearly I‘m not going to do ... five quads in the amount of time I have left going into the Olympics, it is not possible,” said Chan, acknowledging that age is another factor making it hard to keep up. \nUsing his last two Olympics as a base, Chan is aiming for different goals this time. \n“I don’t want to end my third Games being like, ‘why did I feel fear again?’ That is what I am working so hard on,” he said. \n”My goal right now is not gold, it’s not a medal. It is after they announce my name, taking my position and before I hear my music to be like ‘Okay, I‘m ready. I want to be here.’ \n“Because I have never said that to myself when I start my program at a competition. I have never said ‘I want to be here.’ It’s always like ‘I can’t wait for this to be over’ or ‘Okay, here we go,'” he added. \n”If I can master that on the biggest stage, take my position in front of thousands of people watching and have the confidence to say ‘right, let’s do this.’ \n“Imagine how I can take that into my life after skating.” Writing by Elaine Lies; Editing by Greg Stutchbury", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-13T15:57:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-13T16:31:16.011+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
