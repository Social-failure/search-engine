But the Houthis continue to control most of northern Yemen, including Sanaa.\nThe Southern Transitional Council was formed last year to push for a split between the former South Yemen and North Yemen.\nSouthern forces have previously clashed with Hadi supporters, including members of the Islamist Islah party, over control of strategic areas, such as Aden airport and oil facilities.\nWriting by Sami Aboudi; Editing by Andrew Bolton and Louise Heavens\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-27T13:39:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-27T14:14:34.011+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
