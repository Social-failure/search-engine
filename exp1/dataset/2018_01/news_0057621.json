(http:/cnb.cx/2GynOWp) \nSears could not be immediately reached for comment. \nThe company has been shutting stores and cutting jobs aggressively in a bid to turn a profit in 2018 after six years of losses. \nEarlier this month, the company said it was closing 103 unprofitable Kmart and Sears stores. \nOnce the largest U.S. retailer, Sears is saddled with $3.3 billion in debt and is trying to boost liquidity after warning last March that it had doubts of continuing as a going concern. \nShares of the company fell 2.5 percent to $2.59 in afternoon trading on Wednesday. They had tumbled more than 60 percent in 2017.
