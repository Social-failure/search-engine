They went on to beat England 2-1 in the third-place match. \n“It was a national team which played with heart, passion and entertained the Italians,” said the FIGC. \nHe stepped down in 1991 after Italy surprisingly failed to qualify for Euro 1992 after finishing below the Soviet Union in their group. \nVicini coached Italian national teams at youth level for eleven years before taking charge of the senior side and only coached three club sides -- Brescia, Cesena and Udinese. \nHis playing career took him to Vicenza, Sampdoria and, finally, Brescia. \nThe FIGC said that a minute’s silence would be held before Wednesday’s Coppa Italia match between AC Milan and Lazio and the weekend’s Serie A games.
