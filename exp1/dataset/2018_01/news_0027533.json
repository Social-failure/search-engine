Under interim peace deals Israel has final say in allocating radio frequencies in the West Bank and Gaza. 3G is mobile phone technology that allows users to make calls, texts and access the internet. 2G allows calls and limited data transmission.\nThe 3G service will not be extended into the Gaza Strip at this stage, said Suleiman al-Zuhairi.\nWataniya Mobile and Jawwal presently offer only 2G services in Gaza. Entry of third-generation mobile network equipment is dependent on Israel, which regards Hamas, the dominant armed power in the enclave, as a terrorist group.\nReporting by Nidal al-Mughrabi and Maayan Lubell; Editing by Ari Rabinovitch and David Evans\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-15T17:48:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-15T18:07:14.037+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
