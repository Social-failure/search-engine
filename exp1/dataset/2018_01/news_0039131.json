The company recorded a profit of 86.4 million pounds a year ago. \nComputacenter, which had been hurt by weakness in its domestic market as the United Kingdom prepared to leave the European Union, had said earlier it foresaw a drop in short-term demand for its products and services. \nShares of the company were up 2 percent at 0812 GMT.
