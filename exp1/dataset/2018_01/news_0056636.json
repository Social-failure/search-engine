It will be a crystal clear answer. The Council decision is done,” Vytenis Andriukaitis told a briefing in Brussels. \nEMA’s head, Italian Guido Rasi, said earlier this week the temporary accommodation Amsterdam was offering before it finishes building a new site to host the agency was “not optimal”. \nRome was swift to mount its legal challenge, but the Hague has pointed out that the temporary accommodation has always been part of its bid and was fit to host EMA, while the destination building would be ready on schedule in November, 2019. \n“The process leading to the decision was fair and square,” said Dutch Minister for Medical Care Bruno Bruins.
