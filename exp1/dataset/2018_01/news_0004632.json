A building had been reduced to rubble, with only a few sections of wall left standing.\nNobody claimed responsibility for the attack, but it bears the hallmarks of Boko Haram, a jihadist group which frequently uses suicide bombers, often women and girls, to attack crowded public spaces such as mosques and markets.\nDespite repeated government and military assertions that the insurgency has been defeated, Boko Haram continues to carry out lethal attacks on the military and civilians.\nLast week four civilians were killed in an attack by suspected Boko Haram militants on Maiduguri, the Nigerian city at the centre of the conflict with the Islamists.\nIn November a suicide bomber killed at least 50 people in an attack on a mosque, in one of the deadliest bombings of recent years.\nReporting by Ola Lanre in Lagos and Ahmed Kingimi in Maiduguri; Writing by Paul Carsten; Editing by Gareth Jones\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-03T13:29:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-03T13:56:34.018+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
