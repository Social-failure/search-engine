Today we have 20,” RDB chief executive Clare Akamanzi said. \nMountain gorillas are under threat from poaching, war and habitat loss. \nRwanda is keen to encourage tourists to see them, but tour operators and hoteliers say a government decision to double the price of trekking permits from $750 to $1,500 last year slashed visitor numbers.

Adult males grow a patch of grey hair on their back and hips, giving them the ‘silverback’ moniker. \nOne such is Gihishamwotsi, a dominant male in the Sabyinyo family, a popular group viewed by trekkers in Rwanda’s national park.
