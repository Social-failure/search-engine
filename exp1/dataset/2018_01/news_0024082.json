There were also protests in Kram district.\nOn Monday, the situation was calm.\nA woman shout slogans during demonstrations on the seventh anniversary of the toppling of president Zine El-Abidine Ben Ali, in Tunis, Tunisia January 14, 2018.

The economy has worsened since a vital tourism sector was nearly wiped out by a wave of deadly militant attacks in 2015.\nReporting by Tarek Amara; Editing by Ulf Laessing and\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-15T13:46:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-15T14:00:19.005+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
