But minor changes made by the House require a second Senate vote on passage before it can become law.\nThere has been no official comment from the White House on the legislation and whether President Donald Trump would sign it.\nThe “Protecting Young Victims from Sexual Abuse and Safe Sport Authorization Act” would require that employees or volunteers of the USOC promptly report allegations of abuse to law enforcement authorities.\nUSA Gymnastics and other athletic governing bodies would have to implement policies to prevent abuse.\nThe Indianapolis Star newspaper initially reported that Nassar had engaged in the illegal activities for decades, disguising the sexual abuse as medical treatment.\nU.S. Olympic officials have announced that an independent investigation would be launched into how USA Gymnastics and the USOC failed to stop Nassar’s activities.\nThe legislation also lays out damages that victims can seek in civil suits related to cases of abuse.\nReporting by Richard Cowan; Editing by James Dalgleish\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-01-30T10:49:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-30T08:25:32.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
