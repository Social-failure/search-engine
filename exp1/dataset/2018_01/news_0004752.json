While regulators are trying to police these quickly growing markets, the SEC urged investors to be vigilant. \n“The SEC and state securities regulators are pursuing violations, but we again caution you that, if you lose money, there is a substantial risk that our efforts will not result in a recovery of your investment,” the officials said. \nReporting by Pete Schroeder; Editing by David Gregorio\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-04T19:04:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-04T19:13:13.009+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
