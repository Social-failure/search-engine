The United Nations described Myanmar’s crackdown as ethnic cleansing of the Rohingya, which Myanmar denies.\nReporting by Phil Stewart; Editing by Nick Macfie\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-01-23T21:02:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-24T15:46:41.012+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
