Defense lawyers also said Chin had no reason the believe that the steroids were contaminated before they were shipped.\nThe verdict in Chin’s case came after a separate jury in March found Cadden guilty of racketeering and fraud but similarly cleared him of second-degree murder over the deaths of 25 people.\nReporting by Nate Raymond in Boston; Editing by Sandra Maler and James Dalgleish\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-31T20:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-31T20:45:18.006+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
