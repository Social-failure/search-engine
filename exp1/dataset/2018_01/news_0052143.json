The state budget deficit this year is projected at 195 billion riyals.\nThe announcement also appeared to represent a political victory for Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, who launched the purge last November and predicted at the time that it would net about $100 billion in settlements.\nDozens of top officials and businessmen were detained in the purge, many of them confined and interrogated at Riyadh’s opulent Ritz-Carlton Hotel.\nIn total, the investigation subpoenaed 381 people, some of whom testified or provided evidence, Mojeb said, adding that 56 people had not reached settlements and were still in custody, down from 95 early last week. Some cases are expected to go for trial, authorities have said previously.\nOver 100 detainees are believed to have been released. Billionaire Prince Alwaleed bin Talal, owner of global investor Kingdom Holding, and Waleed al-Ibrahim, who controls influential regional broadcaster MBC, were freed last weekend.\nWriting by Sami Aboudi and Andrew Torchia; Editing by Catherine Evans\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-30T14:47:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-30T15:08:53.014+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
