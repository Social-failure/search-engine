But recently top tech companies have drawn criticism from users, competitors and consumer groups over shoddy data collection and sharing practices.\nAnt Financial's Alipay was scolded by cyber regulators on Thursday after users discovered that a feature detailing spending statistics automatically enrolled them into the company's credit rating program, giving Alipay access to a wide array of user data.\nAnt Financial has since suspended the program and says it is conducting an internal review. It did not have additional comment on Friday.\nLast week a government-backed consumer protection group said it is suing Baidu in the eastern province of Jiangsu for failing to properly notify users about which data it is collecting.\nBaidu and Beijing Bytedance did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\nFriday's notice from MIIT says the companies will conduct a review to improve product design and internal management practices.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-12T09:54:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-12T09:54:17.048+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
