Net income available to common shareholders totaled $128.3 million compared to $102.3 million in the third quarter and $113.7 million in the year-ago quarter. The effective tax rate for the fourth quarter was approximately 6% due to a $42 million net tax benefit arising from the impact of the recently enacted Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, including the re-measurement of the company's deferred tax liability. For the quarter, the return on average assets was 1.13% and the return on average common stockholders’ equity was 8.21%. (1) For the quarter, the return on average tangible assets was 1.19% and the return on average tangible common stockholders’ equity was 13.45%. (1) (2) Net Interest Margin : The net interest margin declined five basis points to 2.48% from the third quarter 2017 amount.

Balance Sheet : Total non-covered loans were $38.4 billion, up $882 million, or 9% on an annualized basis from the trailing quarter-end. Loans originated for investment totaled $3.1 billion, a 34% sequential increase and a 52% year-over-year increase. Total Available-for-Sale (“AFS”) securities rose 17%, or $500 million, to $3.5 billion compared to the prior quarter-end. Overall balance sheet growth was 1% as the majority of this quarter’s loan and securities growth was funded by cash, provided by the proceeds of the sale of our covered loan portfolio and mortgage banking operations. Asset Quality : Non-performing non-covered assets represented $90.1 million, or 0.18%, of total non-covered assets. Non-performing non-covered loans represented $73.7 million, or 0.19%, of total non-covered loans. Net charge-offs totaled $3.8 million, or 0.01%, of average loans. The allowance for loan losses represented 214.50% of non-performing non-covered loans.

(NYSE:NYCB) (the “Company”) today reported net income of $136.5 million for the three months ended December 31, 2017, up 24% from the $110.5 million reported for the three months ended September 30, 2017. Net income available to common shareholders was $128.3 million, up 25% compared to the $102.3 million reported in the trailing three-month period. This translates into diluted earnings per common share of $0.26 as compared to $0.21 per diluted common share for September 30, 2017, a 24% increase.\nFor the twelve months ended December 31, 2017, the Company reported net income of $466.2 million compared to $495.4 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2016, down 6%. Net income available to common shareholders totaled $441.6 million, down 11% from the $495.4 million reported for the twelve months ended December 31, 2016. Diluted earnings per common share were $0.90 as compared to $1.01 per diluted common share for the twelve months ended December 31, 2016, down 11%.\nCommenting on the Company’s performance, President and Chief Executive Officer Joseph R. Ficalora stated, “The Company’s fourth quarter performance built on the solid performance we achieved in the third quarter of the year and was notable in a number of ways. We originated $3.1 billion of loans held for investment during the quarter, up 34% from the previous quarter. Loan originations were $1.0 billion higher than the $2.1 billion pipeline we reported in our third quarter results. While some of this was offset by prepayments, our loan growth this quarter was very strong with total loans held for investment increasing nearly $900 million or 9% on an annualized basis. Leading this growth was our core multi-family loan portfolio which grew at a 14% annualized rate and accounted for the majority of the loan growth during the quarter.\n“We continue to lend prudently and conservatively as reflected again by our asset quality metrics, which continue to be solid. Excluding the charge-offs we took during the year for taxi medallion-related loans, we would have reported net charge-offs of less than 0.01% in 2017.\n“The net interest margin was 2.48% during the quarter compared to 2.53% in the third quarter. Excluding the contribution from prepayment income, the margin came in at 2.37%, unchanged from the third quarter and better than management’s expectation of down five basis points.\n“Also noteworthy this quarter was the lower level of operating expenses which declined almost $14 million on a linked quarter basis, ahead of management’s projections.\n“Additionally, due to the recently enacted Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, the Company reported a one-time net benefit of approximately $42 million, which includes the re-measurement of our deferred tax liability. In 2018, the Company’s effective tax rate is expected to be about 26.5%.\n“All in all, we believe that this quarter’s performance lays the groundwork for solid growth in 2018.”\nBoard of Directors Declares $0.17 per Common Share Dividend Payable on February 27, 2018\nReflecting our earnings and our capital position, the Board of Directors last night declared a quarterly cash dividend on the Company’s common stock of $0.17 per share. The dividend is payable on February 27, 2018 to common shareholders of record as of February 13, 2018, and represents a dividend yield of 4.9% based on yesterday’s closing price.\nBALANCE SHEET SUMMARY\nTotal assets at December 31, 2017 were $49.1 billion, up 1.4% (5.5% annualized) compared to the balance at September 30, 2017 and up 0.4% compared to December 31, 2016. During the current fourth quarter, total loans and AFS securities grew nearly $1.4 billion on a combined basis. The majority of this growth was funded through cash and cash equivalents, which moderated overall balance sheet growth. Total deposits of $29.1 billion were relatively stable compared to the prior-quarter and year-end 2016 balances, increasing 0.7% from both periods.\nFor the four quarters ended December 31, 2017, the Company’s total consolidated assets averaged $48.7 billion, below the current SIFI threshold of $50.0 billion.\nLoans\nNon-Covered Loans Held for Investment\nTotal non-covered loans held for investment of $38.4 billion increased $882 million or 2.4% (9.4% annualized) from the prior quarter end and $1.0 billion or 2.7% from year-end 2016. Total non-covered mortgage loans held for investment rose $816 million sequentially, or 2.3% (9.2% annualized) to $36.3 billion and $880 million or 2.5% compared to December 31, 2016. The main driver of this quarter’s loan growth was primarily in the Company’s core multi-family loan portfolio which increased $930 million to $28.1 billion. This represents 3.4% (14% annualized) growth compared to the September 30, 2017 balance and $1.1 billion or 4.2% growth compared to the December 31, 2016 balance. This was offset by a modest decline in commercial real estate (“CRE”) loans, which declined $228 million or 3% (12% annualized) to $7.3 billion compared to the trailing quarter and $402 million or 5.2% compared to year-end 2016. This decrease was mainly due to prepayments.\nTotal loans originated for investment increased 34% on a sequential basis, to $3.1 billion, including 42% growth in multi-family originations and 39% growth in CRE loan originations. The Company continues to originate multi-family and CRE loans which adhere to its conservative underwriting standards.\nPipeline\nThe Company has approximately $2.3 billion of loans in its current pipeline, including $1.6 billion of multi-family loans and $290 million of CRE loans.\nFunding Sources\nDeposits\nTotal deposits of $29.1 billion rose just under 1% compared to both the trailing quarter-end and from the prior year-end. On a year-over-year basis, the deposit mix shifted as interest-bearing checking/money market accounts declined 3.4%, savings accounts declined 1.3%, and non-interest-bearing accounts dropped 12.3%. This was offset by growth in our certificates of deposits, which increased 14.1% from year-end 2016.\nBorrowed Funds\nTotal borrowed funds increased $550 million, or 4.4%, to $12.9 billion at the end of the current fourth quarter compared to the trailing quarter. This was entirely due to an increase in wholesale borrowings to $12.6 billion. Borrowed funds declined 5.6% from year-end 2016, due to a 5.7% decrease in wholesale borrowings to $12.6 billion.\nStockholders’ Equity\nTotal stockholders’ equity rose 11%, to $6.8 billion, at year-end 2017 compared to the year-end 2016 balance and was relatively unchanged from the September 30, 2017 balance. The year-to-date increase is due mainly to the $502.8 million preferred stock offering completed in March of 2017.\nReflecting this quarter’s growth, common stockholders’ equity represented 12.81% of total assets at December 31, 2017 compared to 12.91% at September 30, 2017 and 12.52% at December 31, 2016. Book value per common share was $12.88 at December 31, 2017 compared to $12.79 at September 30, 2017 and $12.57 at December 31, 2016.\nExcluding goodwill of $2.4 billion, tangible common stockholders’ equity totaled $3.9 billion, representing 8.26% of tangible assets, compared to 8.30% at September 30, 2017 and 7.93% at December 31, 2016. Tangible book value per common share was $7.89 at the end of the current fourth quarter compared to $7.81 at September 30, 2017 and $7.57 at December 31, 2016. (2)\nIn addition, all regulatory capital ratios for the Company and its two subsidiary banks continued to exceed the regulatory requirements for “Well Capitalized” classification.\nAsset Quality\nThe following discussion pertains only to the Company's portfolio of non-covered loans held for investment (excluding purchased credit-impaired, or “PCI,” loans) and non-covered repossessed assets.\nNon-performing non-covered assets increased 6% to $90.1 million, or 0.18%, of total non-covered assets at December 31, 2017 as compared to $84.7 million, or 0.17%, at September 30, 2017, and $68.1 million or 0.14% of total non-covered assets at December 31, 2016. Non-performing non-covered loans also increased, rising 6.8% to $73.7 million, or 0.19%, of total non-covered loans at the end of the current fourth quarter as compared to $69.0 million, or 0.18%, of total non-covered loans at September 30, 2017 and $56.5 million or 0.15% at December 31, 2016.\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2017, non-accrual non-covered mortgage loans rose 7% sequentially to $25.9 million, while other non-accrual non-covered loans (which primarily consisted of taxi medallion-related loans) also increased 7% to $47.8 million. Non-covered repossessed assets rose 4% to $16.4 million compared to the trailing quarter and 41% from year-end 2016.\nNet charge-offs for the current fourth quarter dropped 91% to $3.8 million or 0.01% of average loans compared to $40.4 million or 0.11% of average loans at September 30, 2017. Taxi medallion-related loans accounted for $4.8 million of this quarter’s charge-offs compared to $40.6 million in the trailing quarter. At December 31, 2017, the Company’s total taxi medallion-related exposure was $99.1 million.\nEARNINGS SUMMARY FOR THE THREE AND TWELVE MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2017\nThe Company reported diluted earnings per common share of $0.26 for the three months ended December 31, 2017, up 24% compared to the $0.21 per diluted common share for the three months ended September 30, 2017. Net income available to common shareholders was $128.3 million, up 25% as compared to the $102.3 million reported in the trailing three-month period. Net income for the three months ended December 31, 2017 was $136.5 million, up 24% as compared to the $110.5 million reported for the three months ended September 30, 2017.\nFor the twelve months ended December 31, 2017, the Company reported diluted earnings per common share of $0.90, as compared to diluted earnings per common share of $1.01 for the twelve months ended December 31, 2016, a decrease of 11%. Net income available to common shareholders totaled $441.6 million in 2017 as compared to $495.4 million in 2016, also down 11%. Net income for 2017 was $466.2 million, down 6% from 2016.\nNet Interest Income\nNet interest income for the three months ended December 31, 2017 decreased 2% from the trailing three month period and 14% from the year-ago quarter to $271.0 million. Both the sequential and year-over-year declines were due to higher levels of interest expense driven by an increase in our overall cost of funds.\nIn 2017, net interest income decreased 12% to $1.1 billion as compared to $1.3 billion in 2016. Similar to the fourth quarter 2017 trends, the decline in the full year 2017 net interest income was driven by a 17% increase in interest expense due to higher funding costs.\nNet Interest Margin\nThe net interest margin for the current fourth quarter declined five basis points sequentially and 38 basis points as compared to the year-ago fourth quarter to 2.48%. Excluding the 11-basis point contribution to the net interest margin from prepayment income (compared to 16 and 20 basis points for the prior quarter and year-ago quarter, respectively), the net interest margin would have been 2.37% during the fourth quarter, unchanged from the third quarter.\nFor full year 2017, the net interest margin was 2.59%, representing a 34-basis point decrease from the 2.93% recorded for full year 2016. Excluding prepayment income, which added 13 basis points to the margin in 2017 and 22 basis points in 2016, the net interest margin for 2017 was 2.46% as compared to 2.71% for 2016, down 25 basis points.\nProvision for (Recovery of) Loan Losses\nProvision for Losses on Non-Covered Loans\nThe Company reported a $2.9 million provision for losses on non-covered loans in the fourth quarter of 2017 as compared to $44.6 million and $5.2 million, for the third quarter of 2017 and the fourth quarter of 2016, respectively. The higher provision in the third quarter was due to charge-offs in the taxi medallion loan portfolio.\nFor the twelve months ended December 31, 2017, the Company reported a $60.9 million provision for losses on non-covered loans as compared to $11.9 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2016. The year-over-year increase was also related to the aforementioned taxi medallion-related charge-offs during the third quarter of 2017.\nRecovery of Losses on Covered Loans\nFor full year 2017, the Company recovered $23.7 million on certain pools of acquired loans covered by FDIC loss-sharing agreements, as compared to $7.7 million for full year 2016. The recoveries recorded in the respective years were largely offset by FDIC indemnification expense of $19.0 million and $6.2 million recorded in “Non-interest income.”\nOn July 28, 2017, the Company completed the sale of its covered loans to an affiliate of Cerberus Capital Management, L.P. Accordingly, at December 31, 2017, the Company no longer had any covered loans and related FDIC loss share receivable on its balance sheet.\nNon-Interest Income\nNon-interest income for the current fourth quarter totaled $25.3 million, down 77% from the trailing quarter and 22% from the year-ago quarter. The large sequential decrease was primarily due to an $82 million gain recorded in the third quarter from the sale of our covered loans and mortgage banking operations. Also, as a result of this sale, the Company exited the residential wholesale mortgage banking business. As such, there were no mortgage banking-related revenues during the current fourth quarter as compared to $1.5 million in the trailing quarter and $3.3 million in the year-ago quarter.\nIn the twelve months ended December 31, 2017, non-interest income totaled $216.9 million, up 49% from the $145.6 million recorded in the twelve months ended December 31, 2016. The increase in 2017 is attributable to the gain on the sale of our covered loans and mortgage banking operations.\nNon-Interest Expense\nTotal non-interest expense for the current fourth quarter was $148.5 million, down $13.8 million, or 8%, from the prior quarter level and $22.1 million, or 13%, from the year earlier quarter. The main driver for the decline in both periods was lower compensation and benefits expense, which dropped $10.6 million, or 12%, compared to the third quarter, and $9.2 million, or 10%, compared to the year-ago quarter. Also contributing to the lower non-interest expenses was a $3.3 million, or 7%, decline in general and administrative expense relative to the trailing quarter and a $7.2 million, or 15%, decline relative to the year-ago quarter.\nThe efficiency ratio for the quarter was 50.1% compared to 42.1% in the prior quarter (which included the gain on the sale of our covered loans and mortgage banking operations) and 47.2% in the year-ago quarter. Excluding the gain, the third quarter efficiency ratio would have been 53%.\nFor full year 2017, total non-interest expenses declined 1.6% to $641.4 million and the efficiency ratio came in at 47.6% compared to $651.6 million and 44.5%, respectively in 2016.\nIncome Tax Expense\nThe Company’s income tax expense decreased 88%, or $59.6 million, sequentially to $8.4 million in the three months ended December 31, 2017. The effective tax rate declined to 5.8% from 38.1% in the trailing three months. The decrease in both the effective tax rate and income tax expense was due to the recently enacted Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. This resulted in the Company recording a one-time net benefit to income tax expense of $42 million including that portion related to the re-measurement of its deferred tax liability. The Company expects that its effective tax rate in 2018 will be about 26.5%.\nAbout New York Community Bancorp, Inc.\nBased in Westbury, NY, New York Community Bancorp, Inc. is a leading producer of multi-family loans on non-luxury, rent-regulated apartment buildings in New York City, and the parent of New York Community Bank and New York Commercial Bank.

Nevertheless, it is management’s belief that these non-GAAP measures should be disclosed in our earnings releases and other investor communications for the following reasons:\n1. Tangible stockholders’ equity is an important indication of the Company’s ability to grow organically and through business combinations, as well as its ability to pay dividends and to engage in various capital management strategies.\n2. Returns on average tangible assets and average tangible stockholders’ equity are among the profitability measures considered by current and prospective investors, both independent of, and in comparison with, the Company’s peers.\n3. Tangible book value per share and the ratio of tangible stockholders’ equity to tangible assets are among the capital measures considered by current and prospective investors, both independent of, and in comparison with, its peers.\nTangible stockholders’ equity, tangible assets, and the related non-GAAP profitability and capital measures should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for stockholders’ equity, total assets, or any other profitability or capital measure calculated in accordance with GAAP. Moreover, the manner in which we calculate these non-GAAP measures may differ from that of other companies reporting non-GAAP measures with similar names.\nThe following table presents reconciliations of our common stockholders’ equity and tangible common stockholders’ equity, our total assets and tangible assets, and the related GAAP and non-GAAP profitability and capital measures at or for the three months ended December 31, 2017, September 30, 2017, and December 31, 2016 and the twelve months ended December 31, 2017 and 2016:\nAt or for the At or for the Three Months Ended Twelve Months Ended Dec. 31, Sept. 30, Dec. 31, Dec. 31, Dec. 31, (dollars in thousands) 2017 2017 2016 2017 2016 Total Stockholders’ Equity $ 6,795,376 $ 6,759,654 $ 6,123,991 $ 6,795,376 $ 6,123,991 Less:\nGoodwill\n(2,436,131 ) (2,436,131 ) (2,436,131 ) (2,436,131 ) (2,436,131 )\nCore deposit intangibles (“CDI”)\n- - (208 ) - (208 )\nPreferred stock\n(502,840 ) (502,840 ) - (502,840 ) - Tangible common stockholders’ equity $ 3,856,405 $ 3,820,683 $ 3,687,652 $ 3,856,405 $ 3,687,652 Total Assets $ 49,124,195 $ 48,457,891 $ 48,926,555 $ 49,124,195 $ 48,926,555 Less:\nGoodwill\n(2,436,131 ) (2,436,131 ) (2,436,131 ) (2,436,131 ) (2,436,131 )\nCDI\n- - (208 ) - (208 ) Tangible assets $ 46,688,064 $ 46,021,760 $ 46,490,216 $ 46,688,064 $ 46,490,216 Average Common Stockholders’ Equity $ 6,253,482 $ 6,262,792 $ 6,123,550 $ 6,204,142 $ 6,052,051 Less: Average goodwill and CDI (2,436,131 ) (2,436,146 ) (2,436,559 ) (2,436,184 ) (2,437,433 ) Average tangible common stockholders’ equity $ 3,817,351 $ 3,826,646 $ 3,686,991 $ 3,767,958 $ 3,614,618 Average Assets $ 48,175,046 $ 48,526,259 $ 49,388,513 $ 48,624,882 $ 49,299,601 Less: Average goodwill and CDI (2,436,131 ) (2,436,146 ) (2,436,559 ) (2,436,184 ) (2,437,433 ) Average tangible assets $ 45,738,915 $ 46,090,113 $ 46,951,954 $ 46,188,698 $ 46,862,168 Net Income Available to Common Shareholders $ 128,314 $ 102,261 $ 113,733 $ 441,580 $ 495,401 Add back: Amortization of CDI, net of tax - 14 238 125 1,435 Adjusted net income available to common shareholders $ 128,314 $ 102,275 $ 113,971 $ 441,705 $ 496,836 GAAP MEASURES: Return on average assets (1) 1.13 % 0.91 % 0.92 % 0.96 % 1.00 %\nReturn on average common stockholders’ equity (2) 8.21 6.53 7.43 7.12 8.19 Book value per common share $ 12.88 $ 12.79 $ 12.57 $ 12.88 $ 12.57 Common stockholders’ equity to total assets 12.81 12.91 12.52 12.81 12.52 NON-GAAP MEASURES: Return on average tangible assets (1) 1.19 % 0.96 % 0.97 % 1.01 % 1.06 %\nReturn on average tangible common stockholders’ equity (2) 13.45 10.69 12.36 11.72 13.75 Tangible book value per common share $ 7.89 $ 7.81 $ 7.57 $ 7.89 $ 7.57 Tangible common stockholders’ equity to tangible assets 8.26 8.30 7.93 8.26\n7.93 (1)\nTo calculate return on average assets for a period, we divide net income generated during that period by average assets recorded during that period.

Nevertheless, management uses this non-GAAP measure in its analysis of our performance, and believes that this non-GAAP measure should be disclosed in our earnings releases and other investor communications for the following reasons:\n1. Adjusted net interest margin gives investors a better understanding of the effect of prepayment income on our net interest margin. Prepayment income in any given period depends on the volume of loans that refinance or prepay, or securities that prepay, during that period. Such activity is largely dependent on external factors such as current market conditions, including real estate values, and the perceived or actual direction of market interest rates. 2. Adjusted net interest margin is among the measures considered by current and prospective investors, both independent of, and in comparison with, our peers.\nNEW YORK COMMUNITY BANCORP,
