Mandatory Credit: Matthew Emmons-USA TODAY Sports FORGETTABLE CAMPAIGN Foles played one forgettable campaign with the Rams before the disgruntled signal caller skipped offseason workouts after the team selected quarterback Jared Goff with the first overall draft pick.\nHe eventually asked to be released and decided to go on a fly-fishing camping trip with his brother-in-law, discussed options with his wife and, when he still did not have a clear decision of what to do, turned to prayer.\n“At that point there were several teams that called but the only one I was going to play for was Kansas City because of coach (Andy) Reid being there,” Foles said of his former Eagles coach.\n”He’s a man that has always believed in me, no matter what has gone on in my career. He drafted me.\n“I knew that if I went and played with him I would give it one more shot that he could find the joy. If I had joy in there he could bring it back out and he sure did.”\nFoles filled in admirably as the Chiefs backup and while his stay there lasted only one season he said it was a big reason why he is where he is today.\n“Being in Kansas City last year was one of the very special years of my football career,” said Foles.\n“Very grateful for the opportunity that he (Reid) gave me and the belief he’s always shown me. I am sitting here today and I might not be here if I didn’t have coach Reid right there so I am glad he took me in.”\nReporting by Frank Pingue; Editing by Ken Ferris\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-30T23:27:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-31T00:38:15.004+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
