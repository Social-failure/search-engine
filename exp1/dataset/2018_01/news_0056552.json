It just obtained its 50 percent stake with its acquisition of Origin Energy’s Lattice business, completed on Wednesday.\n“The key for us is that we have long thought that Waitsia was a very high quality asset,” Beach Chief Executive Matt Kay told Reuters.\nKay declined to comment on whether Beach would be comfortable with Mineral Resources, a miner, becoming operator of Waitsia, but said Beach would be happy to volunteer its skills running gas projects to any partner.\nHe did not rule out selling Beach’s Waitsia stake to one of AWE’s underbidders, but declined to comment on whether Beach had held any talks with any of the suitors.\n“We’re not actively selling any assets. But if someone wants to put a number on the table, we’re willing to listen and hear.”\n($1 = 1.2370 Australian dollars)\nReporting by Sonali Paul; additional reporting by Aditya Soni and Rushil Dutta in Bengaluru; editing by Richard Pullin\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-01-31T10:55:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-31T05:45:31.013+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
