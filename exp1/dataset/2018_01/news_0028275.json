But there were also four titles, including becoming the first debutant champion since 1998 at the ATP Finals in November.

REUTERS/Thomas Peter \nFor a while in the second round here it looked as though the old vulnerability had returned as he flirted with danger against American qualifier Mackenzie McDonald, losing the fourth set 6-0 before squeezing through in five sets. \nAgainst 20-year-old Rublev he was a set and break to the good before the serve misfired and errors crept in to find himself at one set apiece and a break down in the third. \nTrailing 4-2 the alarm bells were sounding, but Dimitrov turned things around to regain control.

His victory celebration spoke volumes. \nDimitrov said that having so many tools in his locker helps him, as does knowing which one to use. However, his opponent in the next round, Nick Kyrgios, arguably has more. \n“I was not finding the angles that I wanted, but when that fails you kind of go on to the next one,” Dimitrov said. \n”My serve, for example, failed me, too. What are the other options? The one thing I‘m very happy with is I feel I have a big arsenal of tools to kind of deal with any circumstances. \n“How I win right now, I love it. On days that you don’t feel the best, these are the matches that count a lot.” \nGreater challenges await here, but Dimitrov has proved the old adage that you cannot win a grand slam in the first week, only lose it. \n“The bigger upside is it can only get better from now,” he said. “Hopefully the next match.” Reporting by Martyn Herman; Editing by Amlan Chakraborty and David Goodman", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-19T15:46:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-19T16:12:37.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
