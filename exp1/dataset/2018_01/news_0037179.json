( www.hbm.com ) announces its new SomatXR CX22B-R data recorder, for acquiring and storing measured data in mobile applications such as vehicle testing. The data recorder is well-suited to be used in harsh environments, with an extended temperature range of -40 to +80°C. Additionally, it is shock- and vibration-proof, and has an IP65/IP67 degree of protection provided by its water-, dust-, and shock-proof enclosure.\nBoth centralized and distributed measuring systems can be implemented. HBM’s pre-installed catman measurement software facilitates acquiring and storing data in .bin format. This format includes measured values, traceability data, and allows for easy conversion to other formats. Immediate data visualization and analysis during measurements in the field enables users to perform efficient tests and create clear and comprehensive test reports.\nThe SomatXR data acquisition system provides two flexible mobile measurement solutions: the extremely rugged CX22B-R data recorder for interactive testing, and the CX23-R data recorder with a web interface for unsupervised testing. Besides these two data recorders, seven equally rugged measuring amplifiers are available for acquiring different physical quantities.\nThe unit includes an integrated uninterruptible power supply (UPS) for fail-safe operation in the vehicle.\nFor more information, visit https://www.hbm.com/en/6936/somatxr-cx22b-r-data-recorder-for-interactive-vehicle-tests/ or contact HBM at:\nHBM, Inc.\n19 Bartlett Street\nMarlborough, MA 01752\nTel: 800-578-4260\nFax: 508-485-7480\nSales Email: info@usa.hbm.com\nSupport Email: support@usa.hbm.com\nWebsite: http://www.hbm.com\nAbout HBM, Inc.\nFor more than 65 years, the name HBM has stood for reliability, precision and innovation all over the world.
