This decree could have been a threat to our institutions,” said Pascal Picot, chief executive of Marineland Antibes in southern France, the largest marine park in Europe.\n“We want to update the regulation for cetaceans, which dates back to 1981, with the government and experts, on scientific grounds and not based on convictions,” he said in reference to animal rights groups.\nAccording to activists at uk.whales.org, there are around 3,000 whales and dolphins held in aquariums, zoos and marine parks globally.\nReporting by Matthias Galante; Writing by John Irish; Editing by Richard Lough\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-29T18:52:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-29T19:12:58.007+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
