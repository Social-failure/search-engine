Britain will leave the European Union in 2019.\nGermany is the largest exporter of car parts to the UK, with companies such as Continental ( CONG.DE ) and Robert Bosch providing nearly a fifth of all components used in UK-based car production.\nSome 42,500 jobs in Germany depend on suppliers’ ties with Britain and German parts makers generated 16.9 billion euros in sales in 2016 from UK car production, a study by global accounting firm Deloitte published on Thursday showed.\n“Trade barriers emerging in the course of Brexit such as tariffs or regulation would considerably harm supply chains and raise the costs for suppliers,” Thomas Schiller, head of automotive at Deloitte, said.\nReporting by Andreas Cremer; Editing by Catherine Evans\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-11T12:04:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-11T12:37:08.059+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
