Working with a knowledgeable broker is also crucial in identifying the right solutions and partners to help customize these types of risk transfer strategies.\"\nTransactional Risks\nPurchase and sale agreements contain a significant number of representations and warranties made by the parties involved. It is imperative that the parties consider the best way to protect themselves against financial losses that may be incurred as a result of certain breaches of representations and warranties contained in the agreement. In order to effectively address this risk and streamline the process, a representations and warranties insurance policy should be considered.\n\"This risk transfer strategy helps protect buyers and sellers against financial exposures related to the underlying transaction,\" said Goldman. \"The representations and warranties insurance policy is a great alternative risk management tool compared to escrow accounts or other traditional indemnification structures, because of its flexibility. Such a policy also streamlines the negotiation process and reduces deal friction that is often inherent in transactions.\"\nMultinational Expansion Risks\nCompanies that operate across international boundaries already face a set of special challenges and opportunities. In today's highly uncertain geopolitical climate, transactional activities involving multinational entities are subject to rapidly evolving regulatory, legal and compliance issues.\n\"From a due diligence standpoint, sifting through a multinational company's insurance portfolio to address the risk of unforeseen liabilities and insurance coverage gaps can be very difficult,\" said Gillston. \"Using a Controlled Master Policy as a risk transfer strategy can help companies involved in a transaction reduce exposures by pairing a master policy, issued in the U.S., with locally issued coverage. This provides consistency across operations, and can help solve for inadequacies of an entity's insurance portfolio.\"\nTo learn more about what risks to consider in a global M&A transaction, click here .\nAbout Chubb\nChubb is the world's largest publicly traded property and casualty insurance company and the largest commercial insurer in the United States.
