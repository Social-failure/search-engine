He’s a draw anyway now - he hasn’t got to make things big because he’s already big.”\nDavison described the perception people have of the 29-year-old Fury outside the ring as unfair.\n”He’s a stand-up man and that’s one of the first things I noticed with him. He says what he believes and he sticks to what he believes. He’s a very good man.\n“What the public think of him isn’t the real Tyson Fury. With the time he’s had away from the sport and what he’s gone through in his personal life, it’s given him a different light and he’s there where he wants to be.”\nBriton Fury, who has a 25-0 record, became WBA (Super), IBF, WBO and IBO world champion when he beat Ukrainian Wladimir Klitschko in November, 2015 but he has not fought since.\nReporting by Shrivathsa Sridhar, editing by Ed Osmond\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-09T15:57:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-09T16:13:22.015+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
