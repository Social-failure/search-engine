SEEK IMMEDIATE SHELTER. THIS IS NOT A DRILL.” \n“We also must ensure that corrections are issued immediately in the event that a false alert does go out,” Pai said, saying the FCC probe so far suggests Hawaii did not have “reasonable safeguards or process controls in place.” FILE PHOTO - Chairman Ajit Pai speaks ahead of the vote on the repeal of so called net neutrality rules at the Federal Communications Commission in Washington, U.S., December 14, 2017. REUTERS/Aaron P. Bernstein \nThe FCC has jurisdiction over the wireless alerts and has proposed to upgrade them to geotarget them more precisely. It plans to vote on revisions to the alert system later this month. \n“The false emergency alert sent yesterday in Hawaii was absolutely unacceptable,” Pai said. “It caused a wave of panic across the state ... Moreover, false alerts undermine public confidence in the alerting system and thus reduce their effectiveness during real emergencies.” \nHawaii Governor David Ige told a news conference on Saturday that he was “angry and disappointed” over the incident, apologized for it and said the state would take steps to ensure it never happens again. \nIge said the alert was sent during an employee shift change at the Hawaii Emergency Management Agency and that the state had no automated process to get out the word that it was a false alarm. “An employee pushed the wrong button,” Ige said. \nSenator Brian Schatz, a Hawaii Democrat, spoke to Pai on Saturday and praised him for working “with us on developing best practices on the communications side for states and municipalities to make sure this never happens again. This system failed miserably, and we need to start over.” Reporting by David Shepardson in Detroit; Editing by Lisa Von Ahn", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-01-15T01:36:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-14T20:23:18.045+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
