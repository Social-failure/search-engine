Under the terms of a draft bill sent to Congress this week, that holding would be diluted through a capital increase, with an option for a secondary offering of government shares.\nThe bill says the government will have a golden share and that any future private shareholder will have voting rights limited to 10 percent, regardless of the amount of shares it holds in the company after privatization.\nThe sale of Eletrobras will likely be Brazil’s largest privatization since mining giant Vale SA was sold by the government 20 years ago. Eletrobras is Brazil’s largest power company, holding dozens of subsidiaries with operations in power generation, transmission and distribution.\nReuters’ efforts to contact Eletrobras representatives were unsuccessful.\nWriting by Bruno Federowski; Editing by Mark Potter\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-01-24T19:39:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-24T21:23:54.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
