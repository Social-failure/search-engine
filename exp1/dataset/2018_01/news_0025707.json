Its market value of 64 million pounds compares with debt and liabilities of 1.5 billion pounds, according to analysts. \nAny collapse would be felt across Britain and also in Canada and the Middle East where it has worked on landmark projects. \nThe company provides services to government departments including justice, health and education, and has built hospitals, roads and rail lines. GOVERNMENT SUPPORT? \nSpun out of Tarmac nearly 20 years ago and having bought Alfred McAlpine in 2008, Carillion has worked on key construction projects including London’s Royal Opera House, the Suez Canal road tunnel and Toronto’s Union Station. \nIn July last year it won contracts to build Britain’s new High Speed 2 rail line, a key project that will better connect London with the north of England. \nThe GMB trade union called on the government to protect Carillion’s workers and pensioners, but said the company should not be bailed out. \n“Handing Carillion bosses a blank check bail out is completely unacceptable – company bosses should not be rewarded for failure with public money,” it said in a statement. \nThe company met with creditors including RBS and Santander UK on Wednesday to ask them to consider a debt extension or roll-over in financing talks and it was expected to talk with the Pension Regulator on Friday. \nIts pension deficit stands at around 580 million pounds. \nThe person familiar with the situation, who asked not to be named due to the sensitivity of the situation, said the government needed to get involved to help prop up the supplier. The Financial Times said the creditors rejected the deal. \nMany of Britain’s service providers have been hit in recent years after they took on work during the financial crisis at low prices for long-running, fixed-price contracts to keep work coming in. \nThe contracts left little room for delay or failure and have led to problems for groups including Capita, Mitie and Interserve. \nCarillion’s fight for survival is being led by interim boss and industry veteran Keith Cochrane, a former CEO of engineer Weir Group. New CEO Andrew Davies, head of family-owned builder Wates Group and formerly with defense company BAE Systems, joins on Jan. 22.
