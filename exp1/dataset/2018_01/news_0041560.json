It’s good for golf, it’s good for all of us.” \nRahm did not speculate on what he expected from Woods this week, but he certainly hopes the 14-times major champion finds his old form sooner or later. \n”Tiger getting in contention, it would be absolutely amazing,“ he said. ”A lot of us dreamt about having the opportunity to maybe walk the back nine with Tiger in contention and have a battle hand-in-hand.

Mandatory Credit: Joe Camporeale-USA TODAY Sports \nOnly time will tell whether 42-year-old Woods can recapture the greatness of his halcyon days, but if he does then Rahm looms as one of his biggest roadblocks to success. \nOnly the fourth Spaniard to rise so high in the world rankings -- after Seve Ballesteros, Jose Maria Olazabal and Sergio Garcia -- Rahm’s stock has likely not yet peaked. \nRahm said he realised the magnitude of his accomplishments over the past year when he returned home last year. \n“I realised what a huge deal my year had become over there, but I feel like the less I think about it the better,” said the Spaniard, adding he was under no illusions of the difficultly of becoming world number one and then staying there. \n”Beating Dustin Johnson is a really, really hard task. \n“I’ll try to focus more on what’s going on this week rather than what comes with it if I win.” Editing by Ken Ferris", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-24T00:15:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-24T00:52:45.037+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
