The Mauritius bank also has a presence in Madagascar and India.\nKenya’s Chase Bank has no relation to JP Morgan Chase & Co.\nReporting by Maggie Fick; Editing by George Obulutsa and Edmund Blair\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-01-12T18:19:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-13T14:38:53.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
