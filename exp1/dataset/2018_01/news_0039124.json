State’s Omer Yurtseven racked up 28 points, shooting 12-for-16 from the field. Torin Dorn and Allerik Freeman both scored 13 points and Braxton Beverly poured in 10 for the Wolfpack (13-7, 3-4), which lost for the first time in four ACC home games.\nThe second half was played at a rapid clip considering both teams scored 27 points in the first eight minutes after halftime.\nMiami gained separation with a 9-0 run for a 77-65 edge with 6:11 to play.\nN.C. State responded with the next seven points in less than 80 seconds. Twice within five points and with possession, the Wolfpack failed to convert.\nBut back-to-back offensive rebounds for N.C. State led to Yurtseven’s two free throws at the 1:41 mark, closing the gap to 81-78.\nBrown answered with a basket for Miami.\nYurtseven reached the 20-point mark less than six minutes into the second half, making 10 of his first 13 shots.\nFreeman wasn’t in the starting lineup for the first time this season after posting a total of five points in the past two games.\nN.C. State guard Markell Johnson made his first start in more than a month. He was scoreless with 14 assists in his third game back after a suspension.\nMiami led 36-32 at halftime, aided by making half of its eight 3-point attempts.\nReserves combined to score 15 first-half points for the Wolfpack.\nN.C. State erased an eight-point deficit to pull even at 25-25 when Miami went more than two minutes without scoring.\n-- Field Level Media\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-01-22T03:31:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-22T20:41:33.011+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
