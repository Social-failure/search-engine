That’s not priced in yet,” said ING currency strategist Petr Krpata in London. The bank sees the euro at $1.30 by the end of the year.\nHedge funds kicked off 2018 with their biggest bet ever on the euro rising, data showed last week.\nHit by the strong euro, the dollar index - which measures the U.S. currency against a basket of six major rivals - slipped 0.6 percent to its weakest in four months, at 91.308.\nThe dollar was also pressured by data on Thursday that showed U.S. producer prices fell for the first time in nearly 1-1/2 years in December, which could temper expectations that inflation will accelerate in 2018.\nAgainst the yen, the dollar hit a six-week low of 111.00 yen .\nIt was still down a steep 1.7 percent for the week, with the Japanese currency having soared as a routine operational reduction in bond purchases by the Bank of Japan triggered speculation that the central bank would unwind its massive stimulus.\nBitcoin was up 5.7 percent at $14,000 on the Luxembourg-based Bitstamp exchange. It skidded over 11 percent in the previous session after the government of South Korea, a crucial source of global demand for cryptocurrency, said it was considering a plan to ban cryptocurrency trading.\nReporting by Jemima Kelly; Additional reporting by Lisa Twaronite in Tokyo; Editing by Gareth Jones\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.", "external_links": ["http://tmsnrt.rs/2egbfVh", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-01-12T20:41:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-12T18:26:50.010+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
