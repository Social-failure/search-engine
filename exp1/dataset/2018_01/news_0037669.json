But British authorities have indicated that if he left Ecuador’s Embassy, Assange would still be arrested for violating bail conditions, which could put him in a British prison for up to three months. \nAssange and his lawyers assert that if he did leave the Embassy, U.S. authorities would then produce criminal charges against him and seek his extradition to the United States, which they believe could result in a lengthy prison term for the WikiLeaks founder. \nThe source close to Assange said that his legal team were now working on filing a legal case with the International Court of Justice in The Hague, Netherlands, seeking to have Assange’s Ecuadorean diplomatic status affirmed under international law. Britain’s Foreign Office had no immediate comment. \nEcuador’s Foreign Ministry said that only the foreign minister, who is travelling in Chile, was authorized to comment on the Assange standoff.

He said if Britain were ordered by the International Court to accept Ecuador’s decision to treat Assange as a diplomat, and were then to declare him persona non grata, it would then “have to give him facilities to leave” the country unhindered.

Manning, who came out as transgender shortly after her sentencing, recently announced she would seek the Democratic Party’s nomination for a U.S. Senate seat in Maryland. \nDomscheit-Berg said that representatives of a BKA squad that deals with cyber crime and espionage told him the FBI were seeking fresh information about how actively Assange had been involved in persuading Manning to leak U.S. secrets. He said he informed the BKA he was not interested in helping the FBI.
