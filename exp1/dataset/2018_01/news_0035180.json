Slideshow (13 Images) \nFournie’s clothing designs, however, remain at the heart of his business, as do the artisan skills of his team. \nThe 42-year-old, known for favoring 1950s-style silhouettes, last year became a permanent member of France’s select Haute Couture club, whose 15 houses include storied names such as Christian Dior and Chanel. \nHis clients, more than 90 percent of whom come from the Middle East, seek one-of-kind designs -- validating, in Fournie’s eyes, the role of Haute Couture in an age of fast-fashion high street labels and global luxury brands. \n“I love the idea that Haute Couture is bearing the torch for individuality,” he said. \nSome of the numbers from Fournie’s latest collection, in hues of cherry blossom pinks and deep blues meant to evoke an Asian dreamworld, have already been sold, he said. The price tag remains a secret.
