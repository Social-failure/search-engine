It also allows businesses to review simple metrics, such as the number of messages sent by their company that have actually been read, according to the company. \nBusinesses using WhatsApp Business can connect with ordinary WhatsApp users as normal, as thereâ€™s no need for ordinary WhatsAppers to download the separate app, the company said. WhatsApp users will know when they are being contacted by a business rather than an individual, as it will be listed as a business account. \nOver time, some businesses will have confirmed accounts once it has been confirmed that the account phone number matches the business phone number, a blog post from WhatsApp explains. \nThe new app is available to download from today in the U.S. as well as the U.K., Italy, Mexico and Indonesia. It will roll out around the world over the next few weeks.
