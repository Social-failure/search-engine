A level below 100 percent indicates a profit. \nIt also expects to report an investment return of 2.9 percent for the year on average invested assets of $4.8 billion. \nInsurers will have to pay the highest ever claims in 2017, following a spate of hurricanes, earthquakes and fires in North America, according to a report published this month. \nGerman reinsurer Munich Re, in its annual natural catastrophe review, also said last year’s total losses, including those not insured, were $330 billion, the second-worst in history after 2011 when an earthquake and tsunami wreaked havoc in Japan. \nBeazley said in November it faced $200-300 million in insured losses, net of reinsurance, from natural catastrophes in the second half of 2017, which at the mid-point would have a $175 million negative impact on pre-tax profit.
