The circuit will include the Mur de Grammont, a steep and narrow cobblestone road, a staple of the Tour of Flanders and part of the route for the Tour de France in 1969.\nOn its return toward the capital, it will pass the site of the Battle of Waterloo and the Brussels suburb of Woluwe-St-Pierre, where Merckx grew up.\nFormer Belgian cycling champion Eddy Merckx and Tour de France director Christian Prudhomme attend the presentation of the Grand Depart of the 2019 Tour de France cycling race in Brussels, Belgium, January 16, 2018.
