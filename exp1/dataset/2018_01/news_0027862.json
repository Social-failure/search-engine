The climb came even as the country's output of the metal on Thursday posted a surprise jump for December. \"GDP, industrial production and fixed asset investment all recorded strong growth,\" ANZ wrote in a note on Friday about the China data. \"The (metals) sector was also supported by some supply-side issues.\" Late on Thursday, the city of Zhengzhou, capital of the key aluminium-smelting province of Henan, raised its alert for air pollution to red, the highest level, effective from Friday. That means tighter curbs on output of industrial products, including metals. A similar alert in the lead production hub of Jiyuan, also in Henan, was downgraded to orange on Friday. It will last only until Jan. 21 instead of the four days previously announced, although the city said the strictest curbs would remain in place until then. FUNDAMENTALS * SHFE ALUMINIUM: The most-traded March aluminium contract on the Shanghai Futures Exchange (ShFE) closed up 1 percent at 14,765 yuan ($2,308.65) but posted a weekly drop of 2.3 percent. * LME ALUMINIUM: Three-month aluminium on the London Metal Exchange (LME) was up 0.9 percent at $2,261.50 a tonne by 0736 GMT, after ending up 2.2 percent in the previous session. * LEAD: Lead was the biggest gainer among base metals on the ShFE, rising 1.8 percent to 19,570 yuan a tonne at the close on the back of the Jiyuan alert. * CHINA: China's economy grew faster than expected in the fourth quarter of 2017, as an export recovery helped the country post its first annual acceleration in growth in seven years, defying concerns that intensifying curbs on industry and credit would hurt expansion. * ALUMINIUM: China's aluminium production rebounded in December to its highest since June, reversing five months of declines and lifting 2017 output to a record. * SHFE STOCKS: Deliverable ShFE aluminium inventories grew by 9,818 tonnes from a week earlier to a fresh record of 783,759 tonnes on Friday, according to ShFE data.
