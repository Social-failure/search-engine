Berlusconi sought to minimize the no-show, calling Italy’s national news agency ANSA to tell them that he was “very well”. \nA senior Forza Italia politician, Renato Brunetta, told Reuters that he had spoken to Berlusconi during the day and that the billionaire media mogul was fine. \nBerlusconi had open heart surgery in 2016 and he has had regular hospital check-ups and lengthy stays in health spas over the past 18 months. His last public appearance was on Jan. 22, when he went to meet EU officials in Brussels, while his last television interview was on Jan. 16. \nOpinion polls suggest the center-right bloc, which includes Forza Italia and the far-right Northern League and Brothers of Italy party, will win the March 4 vote, but will fall short of an absolute majority. \nBerlusconi cannot run for public office due to a 2013 tax fraud conviction, but he has presented himself as a moderating force who will keep his allies in check should they win power at the forthcoming election.
