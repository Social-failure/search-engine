The United Kingdom and European Union have done away with quarterly reporting,” Tan told a news conference on Thursday. \nCurrently, companies with a market value of at least S$75 million ($56 million) are required to issue quarterly results, taking the tally to about 70 percent of the 750-odd companies listed on SGX. \nIf quarterly results reporting is retained, SGX proposes to raise this threshold to S$150 million. \nCompanies with a market value of S$150 million and a shareholder with at least 15 percent of the companies’ shares will still need to file quarterly results. \n“An increased market capitalisation threshold for quarterly reporting has been suggested to address the relatively higher costs small companies incur,” Tan said. \nSGX is also seeking feedback on whether these options are appropriate. \nAt least 33 percent of Singapore-listed companies will still be required to file quarterly results under the new proposals if quarterly reporting is retained. \nAnd SGX also proposes that minority shareholders of a reporting company can vote to opt their company out of quarterly reporting every three years. \nSGX expects to implement the revamped quarterly reporting requirement in the second half of this year.
