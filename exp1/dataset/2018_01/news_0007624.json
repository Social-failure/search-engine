Canada is working toward legalizing recreational use later this year. \n* Industrials fell 0.2 percent, with WestJet Airlines Inc falling 2.3 percent to C$25.44 after one of its planes was involved in an on-ground collision at a Toronto airport late on Friday. Larger rival Air Canada was off 1.9 percent at C$24.22. \n* The energy group and the materials group, which includes precious and base metals miners and fertilizer companies, each fell 0.3 percent. \n* Valeant Pharmaceuticals International Inc was down 3 percent at C$28.71. \n* The financials group slipped 0.1 percent.
