Now, any good news with respect to filing taxes will definitely bring cheer to the market,” said Saurabh Jain, assistant vice president of research at SMC Global Securities.\nThe broader NSE index was up 0.32 percent at 10,851.50 as of 0546 GMT, while the benchmark BSE index was 0.43 percent higher at 35,410.93.\nBoth indexes were on track to post their seventh consecutive weekly gain.\nThe Nifty PSU bank index gained as much as 2.3 percent, with State Bank of India and Canara Bank Ltd rising more than 2 percent each.\nHDFC Bank Ltd and Reliance Industries Ltd were each up more than 1 percent ahead of third-quarter results later in the day.\nBiocon Ltd rose as much as 4.5 percent after it announced a tie-up with Sandoz.\nCyient Ltd climbed as much as 7.1 percent after its third-quarter consolidated revenue rose.\nBharti Airtel Ltd slipped as much as 2.3 percent after it posted a smaller-than-expected quarterly net profit.\nAsia stocks ex-Japan, meanwhile, gained 0.5 percent to hit a record high.\nReporting by Jessica Kuruthukulangara in Bengaluru; Editing by Biju Dwarakanath\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-01-19T14:20:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-20T17:36:08.003+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
