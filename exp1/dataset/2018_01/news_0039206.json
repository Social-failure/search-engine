Canadian officials lifted one for coastal British Colombia.\nIn Alaska, residents gathered in shelters on Kodiak Island, the closest land point to the temblor, around 160 miles (250 km) southeast of Chiniak, Alaska, at a depth of 25 km - considered shallow but with broader damage - according to the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS).\nThere were no immediate reports of injuries or damage from the quake, which was initially measured at magnitude 8.2.\n\"People are fine,\" said Neil Hecht, assistant principal of Kodiak High School, which was sheltering a few hundred people. \"Spirits are high.\"\nLong lines of traffic formed in coastal communities including Homer and Seward, Alaska, residents said on social media.\nIn Homer, a few hundred cars were packed into its high school parking lot. Shawn Biessel, a 32-year-old park ranger, and his mother were in the lot, a few hundred feet above sea level.\n\"It was a really obvious, pretty strong, long quake. A good rumbler,\" Biessel said in a phone interview. \"It went on for a solid minute and after a while we thought we should get outside.\"\n\nNWS Tsunami Alerts tweet \nPolice drove through Biessel's neighborhood with flashing lights to alert residents to evacuate, Biessel said.\nSan Francisco briefly warned residents within three blocks of the Pacific Ocean or five blocks of San Francisco Bay to prepare to evacuate. That warning was later lifted.\nEarthquakes of similar magnitude are not uncommon in Alaska, which is seismically active. The state has recorded 11 tremors with a magnitude of 7 or greater within 373 miles (600 km) of Tuesday's quake over the past century, according to Zachary Reeves, a USGS seismologist in Golden, Colorado.\nThe largest U.S. earthquake ever recorded was a magnitude-9.2 temblor in Alaska in March 1964, causing tidal waves of more than 100 feet (30 m) high that killed 131 people.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-23T12:07:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-23T12:09:53.001+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
