The bulk of it will remain the same.” \nThe sixth and penultimate round of talks to revamp the agreement underpinning more than $1 trillion per year in trade among the three countries will begin in Montreal on Tuesday. \nThe agenda is likely to include a proposal to mandate more auto manufacturing in the United States, a dispute settlement mechanism and a five-year sunset clause. \nCanada and Mexico have widely disputed those issues, which U.S. negotiators had raised. \nHaving blamed NAFTA for U.S. job losses and trade deficits, Trump said on Wednesday that terminating the pact would result in the “best deal” to update the 24-year-old agreement, in effect threatening to scrap it. \nTrump has long toyed with the idea of triggering a six-month countdown to U.S. withdrawal as a negotiating tactic. Mexico has warned it would not take part in talks with a clock ticking. \nReuters reported last week that Canada was increasingly convinced that Trump was likely to pull out. He has already imposed punitive duties on Canadian softwood lumber and planemaker Bombardier Inc ( BBDb.TO ) that prompted a World Trade Organization trial. WINNERS AND LOSERS \nMore than two-thirds of the economists consulted said they thought the renegotiation was warranted. \nRespondents in the poll cited the energy and technology industries as among potential winners from renegotiation while autos, manufacturing and agricultural companies could suffer. \nHowever, the economic impact of a modernized pact will largely be neutral or positive for each country and their currencies, the economists forecast. \nThe peso, which has been hammered by Trump’s protectionist threats to ditch NAFTA, is likely to appreciate sharply, as much as 8 percent, while the seesawing Canadian dollar could make small gains or remain flat. \nHowever, some respondents said terminating the agreement could send the Canadian dollar and the peso tumbling, hurting those nations’ economies. The greenback could also sink as much as 5 percent. \n“We are dangerously close to allowing an ill-informed group to lose all that NAFTA has delivered in terms of competitiveness of North American companies,” said Diane Swonk, chief economist at Grant Thornton.
