But they have slashed revenue estimates for the March quarter and expect the company to sell fewer iPhones in fiscal 2018 than initially thought. \nBernstein analyst Toni Sacconaghi predicted as few as 220 million iPhones will sell in fiscal 2018, just above the 216.7 million sold in 2017 and well below the 2015 peak of 231.2 million. \nBTIG analyst Walter Piecyk spotlighted a steadily lengthening replacement cycle as new iPhones offer only small improvements over prior models. Now that it has become clear that a new battery can give life to an old phone, more customers may choose to delay an upgrade, especially with Apple cutting the price of a battery replacement to $29 from $79. \nAnalysts still believe Apple will report sales of $272.2 billion for its fiscal 2018, 18.7 percent above its $229.2 billion in fiscal 2017. That will be driven largely by higher average prices paid for iPhones, they said. \n‘WILD CARD’ \nBut Apple does not give data on specific models, and with the wider lineup, analysts must do more guesswork based on surveys and other tools. They also find it harder to predict how much money Apple makes off each phone. \n“We believe that gross margins are a key wild card for investors, given limited transparency into relative margins across iPhone [models],” Sacconaghi said in a note to investors. \nAll in all, it’s a far cry from the days of Jobs, who shrank the company’s product lineup when he returned to the helm in 1997 and kept it limited to a few models of each product at one time until his death in 2011. \nBut the Apple of today has something Jobs never had: An imposing user base into which it can sell a host of other products and services. \nTrip Miller, managing partner at Gullane Capital and an Apple investor, believes Apple’s services segment is the firm’s next hit product. Analyst expect it to hit sales of $34.7 billion this year, up 16 percent.
