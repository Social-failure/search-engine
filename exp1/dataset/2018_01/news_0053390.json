Dr Pepper's stock skyrocketed 25 percent after the news. show chapters 51 Mins Ago | 02:33 \nWhile both companies deal in selling drinks, they play different roles in the beverage sector. Keurig manufactures and sells single-cup beverage delivery systems for personal and commercial use, along with the disposable \"K-Cups\" used to make the drinks. Dr Pepper plays a more traditional role in the beverage market, bottling and distributing numerous soft drinks and juice brands. \nBy combining the two sides of the industry, the new entity moves closer to becoming a \"total beverage solution,\" Dr Pepper CEO Larry Young said on \"Squawk on the Street.\" \n\"In any category, they're changing very quickly now,\" Young said. \"Beverages are moving fast, there's subcategories. We want to make sure that we're there every minute.
