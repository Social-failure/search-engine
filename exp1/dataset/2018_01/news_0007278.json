Migrants sit at a naval base after they were brought back by Libyan coast guards in Tripoli, Libya January 7, 2018. REUTERS/Hani Amara \nOne of the boats sank and the other was badly overcrowded, coastguard officials said. \nSurvivors said that several dozen migrants were unaccounted for and were feared to have drowned. \nThe boats were at sea near Garabulli, where departures have become more common since local armed groups began preventing boats from leaving from the coast to the west of Tripoli last summer. \nSlightly fewer than half as many migrants reached Europe by sea in 2017 than 2016, according to the International Organization for Migration (IOM), largely because of a drop in crossings between Libya and Italy. \nThe IOM said that nearly 120,000 migrants docked in Italy over the course of last year, out of a total of more than 171,500 who arrived in Europe by sea, mostly fleeing war in the Middle East and poverty in Africa.
