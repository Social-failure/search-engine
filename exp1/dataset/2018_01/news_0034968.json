As a result, he argues, the U.S. has two different economies and the gap will only intensify over the next decade.\nHe said the middle class has suffered the most from soft income growth.\nThe middle class \"has the only rising death rate the world,\" he said. \"It has opioids and suicides. It has a number of issues that are there.\"\nDalio founded Bridgewater in 1975. It's the world's largest hedge fund. Dalio is now worth an estimated $17 billion, according to Forbes.\nMorning Squawk: CNBC's before the bell news roundup Sign up to get Morning Squawk each weekday\nJob Industry Advertising/Marketing Automotive Communications/PR Construction/Manufacturing Education Finance/Banking/Insurance Legal Media/Entertainment Medical/Health Care Mining/Oil/Gas/Utilities Gov't/Non-Profit Real Estate Retail Technology/IT Transportation/Shipping Travel/Hospitality Other Get this delivered to your inbox, and more info about about our products and service.
