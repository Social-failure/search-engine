China denies any repression.\nXinjiang governor Shohrat Zakir said Xinjiang would step up border measures to create a “Great Wall”, the official China Daily reported.\n“We will try our best to leave no gaps or blind spots in social security management and ensure the key areas remain absolutely safe,” he said at the opening of the regional assembly’s annual session.\nTechnology along the border would be improved and roads and other infrastructure increased, Shohrat Zakir said.\n“The overall situation was stable in 2017, which made people feel safer,” he said. “We won’t allow separatism to stage a comeback and will ensure religious extremism never rises again from the ashes and terrorist attacks are doomed to failure.”\nThe “Great Wall” comments were similar to those President Xi Jinping made last year during the annual session of the country’s parliament, where he told Xinjiang lawmakers of the need to build a “great wall of iron” to safeguard stability.\nXinjiang has been relatively quiet over the past year or so after a spate of incidents, which has coincided with a massive increase in security, including collecting DNA and other biometric data from the whole population.\nReporting by Ben Blanchard; Editing by Paul Tait\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-23T02:53:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-23T03:12:08.002+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
