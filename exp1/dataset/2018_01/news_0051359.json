The German share price index, DAX board, is seen at the stock exchange in Frankfurt, Germany, January 29, 2018.

The S&P 500 is still up 5.5 percent in January. \nOn Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 362.59 points, or 1.37 percent, to 26,076.89. The S&P 500 lost 31.1 points, or 1.09 percent, to 2,822.43 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 64.02 points, or 0.86 percent, to 7,402.48. \nThe pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index closed down 0.83 percent and MSCI’s all-country world stock index shed 0.99 percent. MSCI’s emerging markets index fell 1.6 percent. \nBenchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury notes fell 5/32 in price to yield 2.7199 percent. \nGermany’s 10-year bond fell to 0.68 percent, down about 1 basis point on the day. After going positive for the first time since late 2015 on Monday, five-year German bond yields slipped back into negative territory. \nThe dollar reversed Monday’s gains. After six straight weekly declines, the dollar index was on track to fall about 3.4 percent for the month, which would be its biggest monthly fall since March 2016. \nThe dollar index fell 0.12 percent, with the euro up 0.14 percent to $1.2398. The Japanese yen strengthened 0.17 percent versus the greenback at 108.80 per dollar. \nBrent crude futures settled down 44 cents to $69.02 a barrel, while West Texas Intermediate futures slid $1.06 to settle at $64.50. \nExpectations for U.S. crude inventories to rise for the first time in 11 weeks may also be keeping oil under pressure, according to a preliminary poll by Reuters on Monday. \n“The global trend seems to be indicating more oil is coming into the market despite best efforts by the Saudis and Russians to curtail output,” said John Kilduff, partner at Again Capital LLC in New York. \nGold slipped back to a one-week low. \nU.S. gold futures for February delivery settled down $4.90 at $1,335.40 per ounce.
