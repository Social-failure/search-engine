FILE PHOTO - Soccer Football - La Liga Santander - Leganes vs Atletico Madrid - Butarque, Leganes, Spain - September 30, 2017 Atletico Madrid's Luciano Vietto in action with Leganes' Dimitrios Siovas REUTERS/Sergio Perez \nVietto, 24, joined Atletico for 20 million euros (£17.8 million) in 2015 following a sensational first season in Spain with Villarreal but failed to adapt to Diego Simeone’s side in two separate spells, sandwiched by a loan spell at Sevilla last season. \nHe scored 10 goals and provided five assists for Sevilla but not even Atletico’s ban on registering new players until Jan. 1 helped him make an impact on his return to Simeone’s side in August. \nHe made only seven starts in all competitions without scoring for Atletico this season and his departure was precipitated by the twin arrivals of Vitolo and Diego Costa after the club’s ban on registering players expired. \nAt Valencia, Vietto will link up again with coach Marcelino, who got the best out of him at Villarreal, and the forward could make his debut at home to Girona on Saturday as Valencia’s top scorer Simone Zaza is suspended.
