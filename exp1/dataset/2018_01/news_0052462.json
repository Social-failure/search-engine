It is also influencing doctors to prescribe shorter-duration opioids.\nThe actions come amid reports of serious heart problems and death in patients who have taken higher-than-recommended doses of the drug or have misused it, the FDA said.\nThey are also part of the agency’s efforts to reduce patients’ exposure to opioids, which killed more than 42,000 Americans in 2016, according to estimates from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\nLoperamide is used to treat short-term symptoms of diarrhea, including Traveler’s diarrhea — a digestive tract disorder that commonly causes loose stools and abdominal cramps.\nThe drug is sold under the brand name Imodium A-D, as store brands and as generics. Imodium is marketed by Johnson & Johnson in the United States.\nReporting by Divya Grover in Bengaluru; Editing by Sai Sachin Ravikumar\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-30T18:37:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-30T18:54:06.011+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
