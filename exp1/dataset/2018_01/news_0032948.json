This (La Quinta) is really familiar to what I‘m used to playing,” said Rahm, who played his university golf in the adjacent state of Arizona. \nIt was not such a great day for another former Arizona State University product Phil Mickelson, who made two late bogeys for a mediocre two-under 70 at La Quinta.
