Reports in the Spanish media put his release clause at 40 million euros. \n“Bakambu’s transfer is being finalised and it could be completed in a matter of hours,” Calleja told a news conference ahead of his side’s King’s Cup game against Leganes. \n“It is in the interest of all parties, there is a buy-out clause and it looks like they are going to pay it.” \nVillarreal are sixth in the Liga standings on 27 points, 18 behind runaway leaders Barcelona, and have been drawn against Olympique Lyonnais in the last-32 of the Europa League.
