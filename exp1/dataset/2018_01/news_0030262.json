The current quarter’s results included $5.6 million in additional income tax expense from the revaluation of deferred tax assets as a result of the reduction in the corporate income tax rate under the recently enacted Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, as well as $1.8 million in post-tax merger expenses. The combined impact of these items resulted in a reduction to quarterly earnings per share of approximately $0.30 per share.\nNet income for the full year 2017 was a record $53.2 million ($2.20 per diluted share) after the inclusion of the additional tax expense and the expenses associated with the acquisition of WashingtonFirst Bankshares. The additional income tax and merger expenses, net of tax, resulted in a reduction of earnings per share of approximately $0.34 per share for full-year-2017.\n“This has been an outstanding year in terms of core performance and our ability to grow our franchise organically. Even in light of the inclusion of the increased tax expense and merger costs, net income for 2017 reached record levels. Core earnings for the fourth quarter continued to positively reflect the effects of loan and deposit growth that we have been experiencing. With the acquisition of WashingtonFirst Bankshares, which became effective on January 1, 2018, we enter the year as one of the premier banks in the region, and with the same steadfast commitment to delivering personalized service to our clients and serving our communities. It’s this commitment that has helped us grow to better serve our clients, employees, and shareholders. We continue to be encouraged by the current economic environment and the prospects for our ongoing growth,” said Daniel J. Schrider, President and Chief Executive Officer.\nFourth Quarter Highlights:\nTotal loans increased 10% compared to the fourth quarter of 2016 and 3% compared to the third quarter of 2017. The year-over-year increase was driven primarily by year-over-year growth of 11% in the commercial loan portfolio.\nTotal deposits grew 11% from the prior year quarter.\nThe net interest margin was 3.57% for the fourth quarter of 2017, compared to 3.52% for the fourth quarter of 2016 and 3.54% for the third quarter of 2017. Net interest income from the fourth quarter of 2017 included $0.4 million recovery of interest income from a previously charged-off loan. Exclusive of this item, the quarter’s margin would have been 3.53%.\nPre-tax merger expenses recognized in the fourth quarter of 2017 totaled $2.9 million.\nThe tax rate reduction associated with the recently enacted tax reform legislation caused a revaluation of net deferred tax assets and resulted in $5.6 million of additional income tax expense in the fourth quarter of 2017.\nPre-tax, pre-provision income increased 14% compared with the fourth quarter of 2016.\nThe Non-GAAP efficiency ratio which excludes merger costs was 55.69% for the current quarter as compared to 57.54% for the fourth quarter of 2016 and 53.76% for the third quarter of 2017.\nReview of Balance Sheet and Credit Quality\nAt December 31, 2017, total assets were $5.4 billion, a 7% increase compared to $5.1 billion at December 31, 2016. Loan growth continues to be the driver of asset growth as total loans ended the period at $4.3 billion compared to $3.9 billion at December 31, 2016. The growth in the loan portfolio was funded primarily by an 11% increase in total deposits from December 31, 2016, to December 31, 2017.\nCombined noninterest-bearing and interest-bearing checking account balances at December 31, 2017, an important performance driver of multiple-product banking relationships with clients, increased by 10% compared to balances at December 31, 2016.\nTangible common equity totaled $484 million at December 31, 2017, compared to $454 million at December 31, 2016. As a result of asset growth over the preceding 12 months, the ratio of tangible common equity to tangible assets decreased to 9.04% at December 31, 2017, from 9.07% at December 31, 2016. At December 31, 2017, the Company had a total risk-based capital ratio of 11.85%, a common equity tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 10.84%, a tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 10.84% and a tier 1 leverage ratio of 9.24%. These ratios reflect the application of the currently applicable authoritative guidance.\nThe level of non-performing loans to total loans decreased to 0.68% at December 31, 2017, compared to 0.81% at December 31, 2016, as a result of the growth in the loan portfolio and a reduction in non-performing loans. At December 31, 2017, non-performing loans totaled $29.3 million compared to $31.9 million at December 31, 2016, and $30.2 million at September 30, 2017. Non-performing loans include accruing loans 90 days or more past due and restructured loans.\nLoan charge-offs, net of recoveries, totaled $0.2 million for the fourth quarter of 2017 compared to $0.4 million for the fourth quarter of 2016. The allowance for loan losses represented 1.05% of outstanding loans and 154% of non-performing loans at December 31, 2017, compared to 1.12% of outstanding loans and 138% of non-performing loans at December 31, 2016. The decline in the allowance to outstanding loans ratio is a reflection of improved credit quality and growth of the loan portfolio over the past year.\nIncome Statement Review\nNet interest income for the fourth quarter of 2017 increased 12% compared to the fourth quarter of 2016 as average loans compared to the prior year quarter increased 10%. The net interest margin improved to 3.57% for the fourth quarter of 2017 compared to 3.52% for the fourth quarter of 2016. Exclusive of the recovered interest income, the net interest margin would have been 3.53%. The maintenance of the current quarter’s margin compared to the prior year’s quarter, exclusive of the recovered interest, reflects the impact of loan growth coupled with rate increases during the year, benefits associated with the execution of funding strategies and higher yields associated with the investment portfolio that offset the increased funding costs for the current quarter compared to the prior year quarter.\nThe provision for loan losses was $0.5 million for the fourth quarter of 2017 compared to $0.6 million for the fourth quarter of 2016 and $0.9 million for the third quarter of 2017. The relative stability in the provision reflects the improved credit quality of the growing loan portfolio.\nNon-interest income remained stable for the fourth quarter of 2017 as compared to the fourth quarter of 2016. Wealth management income increased 10% while deposit service charges and insurance commissions both increased 6% for the fourth quarter compared to the same period of the prior year. These results were offset by a 49% decline in mortgage banking income from the prior year as mortgage loan origination activity declined in the current quarter compared to the prior year quarter.\nNon-interest expenses increased 15% to $35.1 million for the fourth quarter of 2017 comp", "external_links": ["https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=F8niQyJEU7vPlwT6MBQ7FtbYRkJkxfIGJrALECXLgWRuLz5tyjGiFHCoPeVjXooo7ZpJAp09Hlj1nqSlfql4YZVI-fTMsk_YbRBmChHxhVQ=", "https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=VTG6MmKsyrgbgmPtNkc_z60UH_9Q1v7jOLbkLslK5DlapYWvASWuyHmZ-J-B347kmNSnh9B8rzd5tOyb5zmFth8_ngkN9oRIQipxF9akOVaExiBCZdhSnqD4Y1ZTo6at", "https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=F8niQyJEU7vPlwT6MBQ7FtbYRkJkxfIGJrALECXLgWQ1qlvQt-mQMOlCdmGtjCGbpg4FB_SgiMMmPuMg8-22ISUMPlpv4JnP1jQbdRsmfoE=", "https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=_p3Nnnq9_1zYpPX1nnJnmGOyKjj5pwMT8BUI_-cPNg8sE9CtZtJ0K-dMuSMQk32p68lKE5005vYAuT3nEdSifcyxfWL54geuIpu20jza83yh2dx-5ixnv7LweJqnMh0t", "https://www.globenewswire.com/NewsRoom/AttachmentNg/aad0d812-c643-4abe-802a-77e2cb9a1c96", "https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=x0A9C5of0AZU-E_LNpvSGyGuqM_ERzjbacVyjvgfmti7tL02rpqP-vAz13xezbQRMkjTU7UNfo4Xu3vDFfltYXAwM_va8F4eik9fm9hqaNDxMGh9KDmxGXXafyLTWVxc", "https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=F8niQyJEU7vPlwT6MBQ7FtbYRkJkxfIGJrALECXLgWQm_NQ1sjfAXdSHeZZqmmiQI5p6L4joww3VkrZRroM1Wh1liM0X2wTHwWVHIH28s9s=", "https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=YDW1nznbzn5Iqhmmi34VpwAWFwSTVbFwqLrG-_yXi-ubIJuAbz-o9nHz2cBJrvywJDM634vz03wqVV5S__gqsQ=="], "published": "2018-01-18T15:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-18T16:19:56.002+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
