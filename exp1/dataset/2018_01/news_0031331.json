The bodies of two sailors were recovered from the ship while a third body was pulled from the sea near the vessel. The remaining 29 crew of the ship are presumed dead. \nThe Chinese Ministry of Transport said on Wednesday a salvage team had located the wreck, which was at a depth of 115 metres (377 feet) under sea level, and was preparing to send underwater robots to explore it. \nThe SOA said in its statement late on Wednesday it had collected water samples from 19 spill sites, and found water from five sites had petroleum substances at levels exceeding standards.

Strong winds pushed it away from the Chinese coast, where the incident happened, and into Japanâ€™s exclusive economic zone. \nThe ship was carrying 136,000 tonnes or almost 1 million barrels of condensate - an ultra-light, highly flammable crude oil. \n(This story has been refiled to say that statement was issued on Wednesday, not Thursday) Reporting by Dominique Patton; editing by Richard Pullin", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-18T04:29:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-18T04:48:59.010+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
