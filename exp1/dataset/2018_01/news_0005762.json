We ain’t going to get that next March.” \nBritain’s automotive sector is also concerned its cars could face tariffs of up to 10 percent and be hit by customs delays if the government fails to strike the right Brexit deal. \nThere are investment decisions which are pending as companies await clarification on the terms of a transitional deal which will bridge Britain’s exit from the EU in March 2019 into a new relationship with the bloc, Hawes said. \n“Some of those decisions are overdue, they need clarity urgently and certainly the turn of the first quarter is what they have been saying to me,” he said. \nHonda is one of several carmakers considering contingency plans involving possible extra warehousing and stockpiling of parts and has said it needs clarity by March on a transitional deal. \nHawes said any additional cost borne by British plants could hit the sector. \n“That’s the thin end of the wedge ... How do you secure that next piece of investment when you’re less competitive because you’ve got to warehouse?” (Editing by Mark Potter)", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-05T02:01:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-05T02:29:35.003+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
