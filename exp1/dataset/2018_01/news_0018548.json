Yancey won the tied Newport News-area race when election officials drew his name from a bowl.\n“We’ve had an amazing civics lesson in the power of every vote, and I hope the legacy of this campaign will be record high turnout in Newport News forever more,” she said in a statement.\nSimonds said the race underscored the need for election reforms in Virginia. She urged making it easier to cast an absentee ballot and ending gerrymandering, in which a party in power redraws legislative districts to ensure its candidates a better chance of winning.\nThe tie-breaking drawing was Virginia’s first since 1971 but unprecedented in the state because of its impact on the House, election officials said.\nIn another disputed Virginia House race, a 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals panel on Wednesday rejected a bid by voters to keep Republican Robert Thomas from being seated because some ballots were cast in the wrong Fredericksburg-area district.\nCalling the election “irreparably tainted,” Virginia Democratic Party spokeswoman Katie Baker said in a statement that the party would weigh its legal options. A federal judge last week rejected voters’ call for a new election, leading to the appeal.\nDemocrats picked up 15 House seats in November, part of the party’s first big wave of political victories since Republican President Donald Trump won the White House in 2016.\nDemocrat Ralph Northam is to be sworn in as governor on Saturday. Republicans also still control the state Senate.\nReporting by Ian Simpson in Washington; editing by Colleen Jenkins and Jonathan Oatis\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-10T18:58:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-10T19:12:05.032+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
