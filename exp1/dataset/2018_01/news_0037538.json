Rises in oil price tend to increase the attractiveness of new, more fuel-efficient aircraft.\n“No one is rushing to change their fleet strategy on the basis of it just getting towards the $70 mark,” AerCap chief executive Aengus Kelly told the Airline Economics conference in Dublin on Monday.\n“That being said, there is no doubt that oil at 70, airlines are still making money. Oil at 80? That’s a different proposition and things will get a lot more stretched,” he added.
