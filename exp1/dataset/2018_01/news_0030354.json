Bassias declined to name the companies because the tender process is ongoing. \nAs well as Exxon and Total, Israel’s Delek, Italy’s Eni and U.S. Noble Energy are currently exploring off Israel or Egypt. \nDelek Group and its subsidiary Delek Drilling declined to comment. Noble did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Eni has said it bought data packages to see if Crete was of interest. \nInvestors have until early March to submit offers and Bassias expects preferred bidders to be announced by May. The preferred bidder must be formally approved by the energy ministry and the concession ratified by parliament.
