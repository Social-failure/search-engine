He added differences on the Governing Council were not “existential” and merely related to the timing of future steps.\nReporting By Francesco Canepa, Frank Sibelt and Balazs Koranyi; Editing by Angus MacSwan\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-01-26T02:47:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-26T21:44:56.019+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
