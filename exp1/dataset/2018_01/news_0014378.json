Obviously, these are not protests, but theft and damage to public and private property.”\nMainly Muslim Tunisia has a Jewish minority of fewer than 1,800 people. Jews have lived in Tunisia for over 2,000 years and Djerba is home to Africa’s oldest synagogue, El Ghriba, which was hit by al Qaeda-linked militants in 2002 in a truck bomb attack that killed 21 people including Western tourists.\nReporting by Tarek Amara; Writing by Ulf Laessing; Editing by Mark Heinrich\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-10T11:03:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-10T11:19:09.049+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
