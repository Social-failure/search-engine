The candidate will then have a hearing in the European Parliament and finally be appointed by EU leaders. \nSpanish Economy Minister Luis de Guindos is so far the only publicly known candidate and a favorite for the number two job at the ECB. This could offer clues about political positions in the contest to replace ECB President Mario Draghi in 2019. \nWith EU spoils shared around the regions, selecting a southern European would signal that Draghi’s job will go to northern Europe, possibly Germany, euro zone officials, who asked not to be named, have told Reuters. \nGermany is seen as eager to claim the presidency, two decades after the ECB’s creation, but the hawkish views of its obvious candidate, Bundesbank chief Jens Weidmann, will count against him for some, euro zone sources have said.
