It initially proposed buying out M&C&rsquo;s minorities for 552.5 pence a share but was forced to raise its bid after some minority shareholders argued that it undervalued the hotelier.\nM&C&rsquo;s global business spans 137 hotels it either invests in, owns, franchises or operates.\nThe first closing date for investors to tender their shares to CDL is Jan. 23, though that deadline can be extended.\nCDL, Georgeson and M&C declined to comment.
