(NYSE:WEX), a leading provider of corporate payment solutions, today announced a successful repricing of the Company’s secured term loans under its existing credit facility. The lenders have agreed to an amendment that reduces the applicable interest rate margin at current levels for LIBOR borrowings by 50 basis points for the Company’s existing tranche B term loans, as well as the incurrence of an additional $153 million of tranche term B loans. The net proceeds from this transaction will be used to reduce borrowings under the Company’s existing revolver. Following the repricing, the applicable interest rate margin for the tranche B term loans will be set at 2.25% for LIBOR borrowings.\nBank of America, N.A. acted as administrative agent, joint lead arranger and joint bookrunner. MUFG Union Bank, N.A., SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., and Citizens Bank, N.A., also acted as joint lead arrangers and joint bookrunners, and Bank of Montreal acted as documentation agent.\nWEX Inc. reminds investors that on December 27, 2017, it reported the successful execution of $500 million in five-year interest rate swaps at an average rate of 2.21%.
