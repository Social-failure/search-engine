She was the country’s first woman premier, its longest-serving prime minister of the 20th century, and won three consecutive national elections for the Conservative Party. \nBut her attempts to arrest Britain’s post-war decline by smashing the trade unions and privatising the country’s national assets made her a deeply divisive figure.

REUTERS/Simon Dawson \nAnother sculpture of her was decapitated in 2002 at Guildhall Art Gallery in London by a man who attacked it with a metal pole. \nThe proposed new 300,000-pound work was commissioned by the Public Memorials Appeal charity after Thatcher’s death. \nBut council officials said objections had been received on the basis of possible vandalism, that the subject was too divisive to have a statue erected in her honour and that there was already a statue of Thatcher in the nearby House of Commons. \nThey recommended that the council’s planning sub-committee reject the proposal when it meets next week on the grounds that it also contravenes guidelines on the number of statues in the area and the policy that 10 years should elapse between the death of a subject and the erection of a statue. \n“The proposed statue should therefore only proceed if there is an exceptionally good reason to justify exemption to our normal guidance,” they wrote. \nIf approved, however, it would be the second statue of a woman in Parliament Square after this year’s planned unveiling of a monument to suffrage campaigner Dame Millicent Fawcett.
