The Company's third quarter sales level also increased over second quarter sales, as expected, and as communicated to shareholders in the Company's recent press releases. Based on current backlog, shipments and proposals, the Company is expecting another increase for the fourth quarter of its current fiscal year (December 2017 â€“ February 2018) compared to last year.\nThe Company reported net income of $194,000 for the three months ended November 30, 2017, compared to net income of $62,000 for the prior year period. The improvement over the prior year period is due to increased revenue which resulted in higher gross profit, also, the Company's fixed overhead costs remained steady as revenue levels increased. The Company's third quarter net income was an increase when compared to the second quarter. The Company expects to see continued profitability in the fourth quarter and to achieve overall profitability for the current Fiscal Year.\nDr. Christopher L. Coccio, Sono-Tek's Chairman and CEO, stated that, \"This fiscal year has been one of increasing revenues and income, both compared to last fiscal year and to each preceding quarter. Last year we experienced a slowdown in orders as our customers seemed to take a \"wait and see\" attitude regarding the political and business climate in the US. Overseas customers also slowed down their purchases, perhaps affected by the US economic climate or forces in their own regions. All that seemed to turn around with the new year, as it became clear that deregulation and tax reform were major priorities here at home. Whatever the reason, our sales began to increase, and our income did as well. The organic growth has been gratifying, since we have focused on new product development for the past several years, and that has been adding to our top line.\"\nFor further information, contact Dr. Christopher L.
