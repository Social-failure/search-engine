REUTERS/Jacky Naegelen \nWith the bloc’s economy expanding quickly, the ECB has already reduced stimulus twice and investors expect asset buys to end by the end of the year. \nThe biggest obstacle to ending the buys may be the strong euro, which will curtail import prices and put downward pressure on inflation. \nThe currency EURO= has gained 7 percent over the past three months against the dollar and comments by U.S. officials about a preference for a weak greenback leaves the door open to further foreign exchange volatility. \nBut even if the bond purchases, known as quantitative easing, are ended the year, the ECB has promised protracted stimulus through low rates and an oversized balance sheet for years to come. \n“An ample degree of monetary stimulus remains necessary for underlying inflation pressures to continue to build up,” ECB board member Benoit Coeure said in Dublin on Wednesday. \n“We expect the ECB’s key interest rates to remain at their present levels for an extended period of time, and well past the horizon of our net asset purchases,” he added. \nCoeure added that markets also see only limited upside risks to future inflation. \nECB projections see full year inflation at 1.4 percent this year, rising gradually to 1.7 percent by 2020, still short of target.
