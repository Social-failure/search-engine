The S&P 500 was up 4.54 points, or 0.16 percent, at 2,802.57 and the Nasdaq Composite was up 25.02 points, or 0.34 percent, at 7,321.07.\nEight of the 11 major S&P sectors were higher, led by a 0.85 percent gain in the consumer staples index and a 0.63 percent rise in discretionary stocks.\nThe U.S. Senate raced to avert a government shutdown ahead of a midnight deadline with no agreement on funding in sight.\nAlthough the House of Representatives voted on Thursday to extend the funding through Feb. 16, the bill appeared to be on the verge of collapse in the Senate.\n“The market appears to be looking through this as a non-essential event, although we’re seeing a little bit of a pickup in volatility in the last couple of days,” Northey said.\nOil prices were down more than 1 percent as a bounce-back in U.S. production outweighed ongoing declines in crude inventories.\nAdvancing issues outnumbered decliners on the NYSE by 1,718 to 1,111. On the Nasdaq, 2,004 issues rose and 896 fell.
