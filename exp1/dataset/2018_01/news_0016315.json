About 55,000 cases have been recorded.\nCongo’s main concern now is for the capital Kinshasa, a city of 12 million people with poor sanitation and lack of access to drinking water that facilitates the spread of the water-borne disease, Bompangue told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.\n“On a national level, the situation is improving. If there is one place that worries us it’s Kinshasa,” Bompangue said.\nThe disease has killed 28 people and infected 411 in Kinshasa since the end of November, he said. The government has opened free treatment centers throughout the city, but patients must be isolated quickly or it will continue to spread.\n“The numbers are going up very quickly (in Kinshasa),” said Caroline Holmgren, country representative for medical charity Medecins Sans Frontieres (MSF).\nYet many people are also dying in rural areas where health centers have been destroyed by conflict and patients lack access to basic treatment, aid agencies said.\nMost people recover from cholera if treated promptly with oral rehydration salts, but can die within hours if not.\nAbout 60 percent of health facilities in the central Kasai region are not functioning since fighting broke out between government forces and local militia there in 2016, said the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC).\nThe case fatality rate in the region is 14.5 percent compared to 2.1 percent nationally, according to WHO.\n“The medicine is not expensive. It’s lack of access,” said IFRC’s Africa director Fatoumata Nafo-Traore.\n“Cholera is preventable, it can be cured. We don’t need this type of crisis,” she told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.\nReporting by Nellie Peyton; Editing by Ros Russell; Please credit Thomson Reuters Foundation, the charitable arm of Thomson Reuters, that covers humanitarian news, women's rights, trafficking, property rights, and climate change.
