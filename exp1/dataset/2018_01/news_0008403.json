(NASDAQ:LULU) today announced that the Company is updating its net revenue and earnings guidance for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017 ending January 28, 2018.\nFor the fourth quarter, we now anticipate that net revenue will be in the range of $905 million to $915 million based on a total comparable sales increase in the high single digits on a constant dollar basis. This compares to our previous guidance of net revenue in the range of $870 million to $885 million for the fourth quarter based on a total comparable sales increase in the mid-single digits on a constant dollar basis.\nWe also now expect diluted earnings per share will be in the range of $1.24 to $1.26 for the fourth quarter. Excluding the impact of the restructuring of our ivivva operations, we expect adjusted diluted earnings per share to be in the range of $1.25 to $1.27 for the quarter. The previous diluted earnings per share guidance for the fourth quarter was a range of $1.18 to $1.21, or $1.19 to $1.22 excluding the impact of the ivivva restructuring. This guidance does not reflect potential future repurchases of the Company's shares and continues to assume 135.6 million diluted weighted-average shares outstanding.\nThis guidance also continues to assume a 30.4% tax rate and does not reflect the impact of the U.S. tax reform which was enacted on December 22, 2017. We are assessing the impact that the tax reform will have, but expect to recognize a significant income tax expense in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017 related to the one-time deemed repatriation tax on accumulated foreign earnings. We believe that the impact of the tax reform will be favorable to the Company's effective tax rate in fiscal 2018.\n\"We are thrilled with our performance this holiday season that reflects an accelerating trend across all parts of our business, and we look forward to continued momentum in 2018 and beyond,\" said Laurent Potdevin, CEO, lululemon.\nManagement will be meeting with analysts and investors and presenting at the ICR Conference in Orlando, Florida on Monday January 8, 2018. The audio portion of the presentation will be webcast live at www.lululemon.com .

We provide the constant dollar change in total comparable sales because we use this measure to understand the underlying growth rate of net revenue excluding the impact of changes in foreign exchange rates. We believe that disclosing this measure on a constant dollar basis is useful to investors because it enables them to better understand the level of growth of our business.\nAdjusted diluted earnings per share excludes the costs recognized in connection with the restructuring of our ivivva operations and its related tax effects. We believe this adjusted financial measure is useful to investors as the adjustments do not directly relate to our ongoing business operations and therefore do not contribute to a meaningful evaluation of the trend in our operating performance. Furthermore, we do not believe the adjustments are reflective of our expectations of our future operating performance and believe this non-GAAP measure is useful to investors because of its comparability to our historical information.\nThe presentation of this financial information is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for, or with greater prominence to, the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP. For more information on these non-GAAP financial measures, please see the section captioned \"Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures\" included in the accompanying financial tables, which includes more detail on the GAAP financial measure that is most directly comparable to the non-GAAP financial measure, and the related reconciliations between these financial measures.\nForward-Looking Statements\nThis press release contains \"forward-looking statements\" within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 that involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions, such as statements regarding our future financial condition or results of operations and our prospects and strategies for future growth.
