The company will also gain from a lower tax bill. \n“Based on the performance in the first half of the year, and the ongoing benefit we expect from corporate tax reform, we are raising our full-year adjusted EPS guidance,” Chief Financial Officer Jan Siegmund said in a statement. \nADP expects adjusted profit growth of 12 percent to 13 percent for 2018, up from its prior forecast 5 percent to 7 percent growth. \nRevenue from its professional employer organization services unit, which caters to small and medium-sized businesses and is a major contributor to its revenue, rose 15 percent to $945.3 million in the second quarter. \nThe company’s net income fell to $467.5 million, or $1.05 per share, in the second quarter ended Dec. 31 from $510.9 million, or $1.13 per share, a year earlier. \nExcluding one-time items the company earned 99 cents per share. Total revenue rose to $3.24 billion from $2.99 billion. \nAnalysts on average were expecting the company to report a profit of 90 cents per share on a revenue of $3.18 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. \nADP shares were up 1.2 percent at $122.28 in premarket trading.
