REUTERS/David Gray “Kvitova’s attacking tennis brought her two Wimbledon titles, and the Plexicushion courts in Melbourne are lightning quick - like grass, only faster - so the surface should be perfect for her.”\nSerena Williams decided not to defend her title in Melbourne this year after saying she was not yet ready to compete at the top level after giving birth to her first child in September.\nIt leaves her sister Venus with another opportunity to win her first Australian Open title, having finished runner-up last year.\n“While this tournament is wide open, and there are a number of players who could win the title, I would give Williams a slight edge over the others,” Navratilova added.\n“Last year, Williams came so close in Melbourne... and now she goes into the tournament knowing she won’t have to deal with Serena, and that should put some pep in her step.”\nThe first grand slam of the year begins at Melbourne Park on Monday.\nReporting by Hardik Vyas in Bengaluru; Editing by Christian Radnedge\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-12T20:05:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-12T20:20:10.020+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
