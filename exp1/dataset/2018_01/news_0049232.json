Moe is expected to be sworn in as premier in the coming days.\nMoe won the race after five rounds of voting, beating out five rivals who sought to replace Wall, who is retiring after serving as premier for a decade.\nSaskatchewan is home to some of the world’s biggest potash and uranium reserves, which are mined by companies including Nutrien Ltd and Cameco Corp. The provincial government earns royalties from production of its mined resources, as well as of crude oil.\nMoe will become premier as the province struggles to end budget deficits caused by steep declines in commodity prices.\nWall has been an outspoken critic of Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s Liberal government and its plans for a carbon-pricing system.\nMoe, a former provincial environment minister, has vowed to continue to fight the Liberal government plan, saying it would do nothing to reduce carbon emissions while costing Saskatchewan’s economy more than C$2 billion ($1.6 billion).\n($1 = 1.2307 Canadian dollars)\nReporting by Jim Finkle in Toronto and Rod Nickel in Winnipeg; Editing by Chris Reese\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-28T05:15:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-28T05:47:40.106+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
