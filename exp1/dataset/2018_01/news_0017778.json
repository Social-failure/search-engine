The estimated losses are approximately evenly split between the Company's Insurance and Reinsurance segments.\nTotal aggregate net loss estimates related to the fourth quarter 2017 catastrophes are $315 million, including the previously announced $250 million related to the October 2017 Northern California wildfires and other events. The total aggregate loss estimates are pre-tax and net of reinsurance, reinstatement and adjustment premiums and redeemable non-controlling interest.\nThe Company also reaffirmed its previously disclosed aggregate net losses related to the third quarter 2017 catastrophes. Since these events, XL has continued to pay claims and receive reported loss information from its clients and brokers. Ongoing assessment has resulted in approximately 6% of the third quarter 2017 aggregate net losses being reallocated from the Reinsurance Segment to the Insurance Segment.\nAs a result of the reduced US corporate income tax rate enacted as part of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (\"US Tax Reform\"), XL expects to recognize a one-time tax charge in the fourth quarter of 2017 related to the revaluation of its net Deferred Tax Asset (\"DTA\"). This charge is estimated to be approximately $98 million based on the Company's net US DTA as of September 30, 2017. The actual charge will depend on XL's results for the fourth quarter 2017. The charge will not affect XL's Operating Net Income, a non-GAAP financial measure. Based on XL's preliminary assessment, XL does not currently expect US Tax Reform to have a material impact going forward on its average global effective tax rate.\nThe Company's preliminary loss estimates are based on its review of individual treaties and policies expected to be impacted, along with available client and industry data. These preliminary estimates involve the exercise of considerable judgment. Given that facts are still developing, as well as the complexities of the nature of the events, there is considerable uncertainty associated with the loss estimates for these events and such estimates are accordingly subject to revision as additional information becomes available. Actual losses may differ materially from these preliminary estimates.\nThe Company's preliminary assessment of the impact of US Tax Reform is based upon XL's current interpretation thereof and remains subject to further clarifications of US Tax Reform that cannot be estimated at this time, including the issuance of any clarifying technical corrections, regulations and/or supplemental legislation, future interpretations by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (\"FASB\"), or changes to any of the foregoing, which could have implications to XL, as well as changes in assumptions made by the Company. As a result, the actual impact on the Company, including but not limited to our DTA, may vary from this preliminary assessment.\nAbout XL Group Ltd\nXL Group Ltd (NYSE:XL), through its subsidiaries and under the XL Catlin brand, is a global insurance and reinsurance company providing property, casualty and specialty products to industrial, commercial and professional firms, insurance companies and other enterprises throughout the world.
