I guess so,” he said. \n”I think that it was just little bit difficult to adjust, especially the beginning of the match. With the roof closed, it was way, way cooler than I expected. \n“That was very, very difficult, especially for the final to, you know, be in that kind of a situation.” \nHaving also lost the Wimbledon final to Federer six months ago when he was hobbled by blisters, Cilic must be wondering if he will ever get a fair crack against the Swiss maestro.
