Strong Syria ally Russia called the plans a plot to dismember Syria and place part of it under U.S. control, and Turkey described the force as a “terror army.”\n“The new plan that the Americans have in mind for Syria is violation of international laws and a plot against sovereignty and security of Syria and region,” Rouhani was Quote: d by state media as saying during a meeting with the speaker of the Syrian parliament Hammouda Youssef Sabbagh.\nSabbagh was in Tehran for a conference of parliamentary speakers.\nIran supports Assad in the nearly seven-year civil war against rebel forces and Islamic State militants, sending weapons and soldiers.\nIranian Foreign Ministry spokesman Bahram Qasemi said earlier on Tuesday that the planned U.S.-backed force inside Syria would “fan the flames of war” and raise tensions.\n“The U.S. announcement of a new border force in Syria is an obvious interference in the internal affairs of this country,” Qasemi was Quote: d as saying by state news agency IRNA.\nQasemi urged all U.S. forces to leave Syria immediately.\nThe United States is at the head of an international coalition using air strikes and special forces troops to aid fighters on the ground battling Islamic State militants in Syria since 2014. It has about 2,000 troops on the ground in Syria.\nRussian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov and his Iranian counterpart Mohammad Javad Zarif discussed the conflict in Syria in a phone conversation, the Russian Foreign Ministry said on Tuesday.\nReporting by Bozorgmehr Sharafedin; Editing by Raissa Kasolowsky\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-16T11:49:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-16T12:05:43.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
