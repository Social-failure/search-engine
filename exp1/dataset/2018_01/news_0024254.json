It is now a 100 million passenger a year airport,” he said, referring to the rise of the city in the United Arab Emirates as a hub for transfer traffic, especially between Europe and Asia.\nWow has focused on low-cost travel across the Atlantic. It uses smaller single-aisle planes to fly between Iceland and many destinations in the United States and Europe, helping to keep costs down as they do not need as many seats to fill them up.\nWow’s fleet currently comprises 14 Airbus A320 family aircraft and three widebody A330 planes. It plans to increase the overall size of the fleet to 24 by the end of 2018.\n“ROOM FOR GROWTH”\nWow has added to a revival of budget transatlantic travel, driven by Norwegian Air Shuttle ( NWC.OL ), that has prompted traditional long-haul players such as British Airways parent IAG ( ICAG.L ), Air France-KLM ( AIRF.PA ) and Delta ( DAL.N ) to set up new operations or change pricing structures.\n“I think we like to say that we attract the smart traveler, meaning people who want to get value for money and not pay ridiculously high prices for legacy airlines or older aircraft and mediocre service ” said Mogensen, who is sole owner of Wow.\nWow sees “plenty of room for growth” expanding into Asia, though he declined to name planned future destinations.\nMogensen said Wow’s strategy was to “go further and deeper” into the United States and offer flights to places where passengers were unlikely to find routes directly from Europe.\nWow has added five flights to the Mid-West - Cleveland, Detroit, St. Louis, Dallas and Cincinati - that are due to start up in April or May, he said.\nWow mainly competes with Norwegian Air on low-cost transatlantic routes from the Nordic countries. It has been operating on these routes since 2015.\nNorwegian Air has a little over half of the market share in the fast-growing, low-cost, long-haul transatlantic market, while Wow controls a quarter, according to data from OAG flightview.\nReporting by Tommy Lund and Thyagaraju Adinarayan in Gdynia with additional reporting by Victoria Bryan; Editing by Gareth Jones\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-01-16T01:04:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-15T22:22:42.010+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
