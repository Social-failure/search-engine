REUTERS/Kim Kyung-Hoon \nNorth Korea conducted its most recent and biggest nuclear bomb test in September and has tested dozens of ballistic missiles. The latest missile test in November reached an altitude of about 4,475 km (2,780 miles) and flew 950 km (590 miles), passing over Japan before splashing into waters in Japan’s exclusive economic zone. \nPyongyang says its weapons programmes are a necessary defence against a possible U.S. invasion.

That came days after a similar false alert caused panic across Hawaii. \n“I am not that worried about North Korea, if something happened that would be frightening,” said Hidenobu Kondo, one of the volunteer evacuees. However, the 50-year-old company employee said the drill would not be of much use in the event of real attack. \n“If I was at work it might be easy to evacuate, but If I was outside somewhere it would be more difficult,” Kondo said. \nJapan’s defences against a ballistic missile strike include Aegis destroyers in the Sea of Japan armed with interceptor missiles designed to destroy warheads in space. PAC-3 Patriot missile batteries represent a last line of defence against warheads that can plunge to their targets at several kilometres per second. \nJapan has also decided to buy two land-based Aegis batteries and cruise missiles that could strike North Korean missile sites.
