Security Council resolutions.\n‘GRAVE AND IMMINENT THREAT’\nJapan’s envoy Nobushige Takamizawa said North Korea’s nuclear and missile deployment constituted “a grave and imminent threat to the international community” and pressure must be increased on Pyongyang.\nHan said nuclear tests last year had allowed his country to “perfect a national nuclear force” in a safe and transparent manner.\n“Thus the DPRK (Democratic People’s Republic of Korea) at last came to possess a powerful and reliable war deterrent, which no force and nothing can reverse,” he told the Geneva forum.\n“I am proudly saying that DPRK’s nuclear force is capable of frustrating and countering any nuclear threats from the U.S. and it constitutes a powerful deterrent that prevents the U.S. from starting an adventurous war.”\nHan said as a “responsible nuclear power” North Korea could not resort to using the weapons unless hostile forces violate its sovereignty or interests.\nU.S. disarmament ambassador Robert Wood said: ”The United States will not recognize North Korea as a nuclear weapon state.\nRelated Coverage CIA believes North Korea weapons aimed at coercion, not just defense: Pompeo “If the North wishes to return and be in the good graces of the international community, it knows what it has to do, it has to take steps toward denuclearisation of the Korean peninsula.”\n“The international pressure on North Korea is profound, it is intense and it will continue,” he added.\nWood, asked whether the inter-Korean dialogue was due to pressure on Pyongyang, later told reporters: “Absolutely, I think it very clear that the pressure the international community has put upon North Korea has got it to take a much softer tone with regard to the Republic of Korea and its desire now to participate in the upcoming Olympics.”\nadditional reporting by Cecile Mantovani; Editing by Robin Pomeroy and Janet Lawrence\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-23T15:32:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-23T15:47:53.055+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
