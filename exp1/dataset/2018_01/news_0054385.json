And then there’s an adjustment. But certainly the fundamentals at present in the U.S. are quite robust.”\nThe U.S. dollar extended its fall against other currencies last week when U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said he was not concerned about where the dollar was in the short term. Trump later said he wanted to see a strong dollar.\nMnuchin’s comments raised concerns among some policymakers including European Central Bank President Mario Draghi.
