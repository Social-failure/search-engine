He also called for more immediate research.\n“I will never impose a ban if there is no credible alternative,” Macron said in a speech to farmers in the Auvergne region in central France.\n“We cannot leave a farmer without a solution or with a solution that would not be tenable because someone else nearby would not have the same constraints.”\nFrench agriculture research institute INRA said in a report in early December alternatives to glyphosate, such as additional weeding and ploughing, could be found in most cases.\nMacron said more research was needed in some areas, particularly for soil conservation or hillside crops, but with the principle that “I will never impose an exit if there is no credible alternative.”\nReporting by Sybille de La Hamaide and Gus Trompiz, editing by David Evans\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-25T17:54:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-25T18:08:55.012+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
