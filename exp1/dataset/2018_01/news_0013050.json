LME-NI-MNET \nDOLLAR: Metals were boosted by a fall in the dollar against a basket of currencies after a report that China was ready to slow or halt its U.S. treasury purchases. \nGLOBAL GROWTH: Expectations of healthy demand for metals were bolstered after the World Bank forecast global economic growth of 3.1 percent in 2018, up from 3 percent last year. \nLEAD WARRANTS: Two large warrant holdings fuelled concern over the immediate availability of lead on the LME. Exchange data showed one entity held between 30 and 39 percent of warrants and another between 40 and 49 percent of warrants. <0#LME-WHL> \nLEAD PREMIUM: The shortest time spread on lead, tom/next CMCUT-0, which represents the premium to roll over a position for a day, soared to a high of $10 a tonne from $1.50 a day earlier. LME Lead ended up 0.2 percent at $2,550 a tonne. \nZINC STOCKS: On-warrant zinc stocks available to the market at LME-registered warehouses fell to 129,300 tonnes after 9,950 tonnes of cancellations, supporting prices. MZNSTX-TOTAL \nOn-warrant inventories have fallen by around 35,000 tonnes this month, helping zinc rise to its highest in more than a decade on Tuesday. LME zinc finished flat at $3,336. \nOTHER METALS: Copper closed 0.7 percent higher at $7,153, aluminium ended up 1.4 percent at $2,182 and tin finished 0.6 percent higher at $20,065.
