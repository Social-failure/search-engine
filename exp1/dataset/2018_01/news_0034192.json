A 7.9 earthquake is extremely strong, although Alaska’s legendary quake of 1964—the U.S.’s largest ever, with 131 lives lost—measured 9.2. \nTsunami warnings have been issued for Alaska and British Columbia. Washington, Oregon and even California and Hawaii have been put on tsunami watch. \n“Based on all available data a tsunami may have been generated by this earthquake that could be destructive on coastal areas even far from the epicentre,” the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center said in an advisory notice . \nAlthough it is remarkable for its scale, this is not the only earthquake to have occurred around the Pacific “Ring of Fire” in recent hours. \nA magnitude-6.1 quake also struck in Indonesia , although this prompted no tsunami warnings. That quake damaged buildings in the capital, Jakarta. \nMeanwhile, a volcanic eruption in Japan on Tuesday morning killed a soldier and injured almost a dozen more people.
