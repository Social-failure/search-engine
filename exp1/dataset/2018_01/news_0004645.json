Foreign investors net bought 18.5 billion rupees worth equities in 2017, and 633.5 million rupees worth of stocks in 2016. \nThe index has risen 2.26 percent in 2017, posting the first annual increase in three years, after falling 9.7 percent in 2016. \nSince March 2017, treasury bill rates have fallen between 188 and 216 basis points though end-December, mainly driven by foreign investors buying treasury bonds, resulting in declining market interest rates. \nAnalysts also said the 2018 economic growth trajectory would help boost market sentiment. \nSri Lanka’s economic growth in 2018 is forecast at 5-5.5 percent, bouncing back from an anticipated four-year low of less than 4 percent last year, central bank Governor Indrajit Coomaraswamy said on Wednesday.
