The 2018 capital program is balanced to anticipated funds flow using a $55/bbl Brent oil price forecast. The capital program may be increased if the recent run-up in Brent prices is sustained.\nEgypt\nThe $29.1 million Egypt program has $11.8 million (41%) allocated to exploration and $17.3 million (59%) to development. The $11.8 million 2018 exploration program is focused entirely on the Western Desert with 5 exploration wells planned (2 wells in South Ghazalat, 2 wells in NW Sitra and 1 well in South Alamein). The $17.4 million 2018 development program is focused entirely on the Eastern Desert which includes: 8 development wells (5 in West Bakr, 2 in NW Gharib and 1 in West Gharib) and development/maintenance projects in West Bakr, NW Gharib and West Gharib.\nThe primary focus of the 2018 Egypt plan is to sustain/grow Eastern Desert production and to evaluate the Company’s 1 million+ acres of exploration lands. The exploration program is designed to test an independent structure at South Alamein to prove up additional oil reserves on the concession and to test four independent structures on South Ghazalat and N.W. Sitra. The South Ghazalat and N.W. Sitra exploration wells are basin opening wells which could also de-risk 13 of the 21 additional prospects mapped on 3-D seismic. No production is budgeted from the Western Desert exploration assets in 2018.\nCanada\nThe $12.2 million (C$15.3 million) Canada program consists of 6 (5.5 net) horizontal (multi-stage frac) wells targeting the Cardium light oil resource at Harmattan and additional maintenance/development capital. The Cardium drilling program in 2018 provides growth in oil and liquids production. The development program is expected to increase the Canadian oil and liquids weighting to 67% from 60% in 2017.\nThe 2018 well design will be similar to the 2017 which targeted one mile horizontal laterals with multi-stage facture stimulations placing ~600 tonnes of proppant per well. The final 2018 completion design will incorporate lessons learned and results from the 2017 program. Based on 2017 results, the Company is budgeting ~$2.0 million (C$2.5 million) per well to drill, complete, equip and tie-in for the 2018 program.\nThe approved 2018 capital program is summarized in the following table:\nConcession TransGlobe 2018 Capital ($MM) Gross Well Count Development Exploration Total (Drilling) Wells* Other Wells Other Devel Explor Total West Gharib 2.6 1.1 — — 3.7 1 — — West Bakr 7.3 3.1 — — 10.4 5 — 5 NW Gharib 2.4 0.9 - - 3.3 2 - 2 NW Sitra — — 5.2 0.2 5.4 — 2 2 South Ghazalat — — 3.3 0.2 3.5 — 2 2 South Alamein — — 2.8 - 2.8 — 1 1 Egypt $ 12.3 $ 5.1 $ 11.342 $ 0.4 $ 29.1 8 5 13 Canada $ 11.2 $ 1.1 — — $ 12.2 6 — 6 Total 2018 $ 23.4 $ 6.6 $ 11.3 $ 0.4 $ 41.3 14 5 19 Splits (%) 71% 29% 100 % 74 % 26 % 100 % *Wells includes new wells, completions, workovers, recompletions and equipping.\n2018 PRODUCTION OUTLOOK\nThe 2018 production outlook for the Company is provided as a range to reflect timing and performance contingencies.\nTotal corporate production is expected to range between 14.2 MBoepd and 15.6 MBoepd for 2018 (mid-point of 14.9 MBoepd) with a 94% weighting to oil and liquids. Egypt oil production is expected to range between 12.0 and 13.0 MBopd in 2018. Canadian production is expected to range between 2.2 and 2.6 MBoepd in 2018, adjusting for a one month shut-in for plant and facility turn-arounds scheduled for May in the Harmattan area. The May shut-in reduces corporate production by approximately 200 Boepd on an annualized basis.\nMANAGEMENT PROMOTIONS\nAs part of TransGlobe’s succession plan, the Company is pleased to announce that Randy Neely has been promoted to President and Edward Ok has been promoted to VP Finance and CFO, effective immediately.
