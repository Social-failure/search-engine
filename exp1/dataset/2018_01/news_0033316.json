He said it had imposed overly burdensome rules on banks that had restricted their ability to make loans and had cut into economic growth.\nThe nomination of Quarles was Trump's first move to remake the Fed. Trump has also nominated Fed board member Jerome Powell to succeed current Fed Chair Janet Yellen when her term ends on Feb. 3 and Marvin Goodfriend, an economics professor at Carnegie Mellon University, for an empty Fed board seat. When Yellen leaves the board next month, Trump will still have three empty seats to fill on the seven-member board.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-19T22:40:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-20T10:55:02.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
