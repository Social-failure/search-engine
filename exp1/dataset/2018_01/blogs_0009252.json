Intel, Nvidia and Amazon were among companies with self-driving car announcements this week at CES. Getty Images Intel Corp. Senior Vice President and CEO and Chief Technology Officer of Mobileye Amnon Shashua (L) speaks in front of a Ford Fusion with Mobileye autonomous driving technology during a keynote address by Intel Corp. \nThe promise of self-driving cars has gone mainstream, and this week's massive CES trade show was proof. \nAmazon , Intel , Nvidia and Cisco all made announcements about autonomous driving at CES, joining a host of rivals and partners that have publicly reported their efforts. To accommodate, the annual Las Vegas trade show expanded its space for self-driving technologies this year by over one third. \nThey're coming late to the game: Alphabet's Waymo, Elon Musk's Tesla and the auto giants have all been developing self-driving technology for years. But nearly all the major tech companies now agree that the market potential is too big to ignore. \nHere's where the 12 most valuable U.S. tech companies are focusing their investment in autonomous driving, ranked by market cap from biggest to smallest. Apple Source: Apple Inc. Apple CarPlay. \nRumors of an Apple Car were put to bed last year when CEO Tim Cook said the company was working on \"autonomous systems,\" or software that could power self-driving cars. That was a relief to investors who worried about Apple taking on Tesla , Toyota , GM and other car manufacturers. \nCook hasn't made firm promises about self-driving technologies or dates by which they'll hit the market. Apple is partnering with Hertz to test its autonomous software in some of the company's rental cars (Lexus SUVs) on the streets of San Francisco, according to filings with the California Department of Motor Vehicles. \nSiri, CarPlay and other Apple software will probably get more usage once autonomous vehicles become a reality and drivers are free to pay attention to their screens, not the road. Alphabet \nGoogle has been talking up autonomous vehicles since 2009 when Sebastian Thrun launched the company's groundbreaking driverless car effort. \nIn late 2016, Alphabet renamed its self-driving car unit Waymo. Seen as a leader in the nascent industry, Waymo is building an end-to-end self-driving system filled with sensors and software so \"you can go door to door without taking the wheel,\" as its website says. Waymo claims to have 4 million miles of real-world driving experience and data gathered from cities including Mountain View, California, as well as Austin and Phoenix. \nWaymo has an early-rider program in Phoenix that lets people use its autonomous cars for their daily transportation needs. It's teaming up with Avis to make the vehicles rentable. The company has also partnered with AutoNation to provide vehicle maintenance and support, and with Intel for processors to power the cars. Microsoft VCG | Getty Images Baidu driverless cars in test run during the 3rd World Internet Conference (WIC) on November 17, 2016 in Jiaxing, Zhejiang Province of China. \nMicrosoft has a number of partnerships with automakers developing internet-connected and autonomous vehicles including BMW, Ford, Renault-Nissan, Toyota and Volvo. But its most intriguing deal in this new market is with the Chinese internet company Baidu . \nBaidu is developing an open source platform that it hopes will become the \"Android\" of self-driving cars, dubbed Apollo. Microsoft joined Baidu's Apollo \"alliance,\" gaining a channel for sales of Azure cloud services to companies that use Apollo to build and run their self-driving cars. That deal only applies to companies using Apollo outside of China. \nAdditionally, Microsoft has partnered with and provides Azure cloud services to Ola, Uber's competitor in India, which is expected to offer self-driving vehicles on its app eventually. Amazon Getty Images \nAmazon's efforts in autonomous transportation appear most focused on getting items to consumers as quickly and efficiently as possible. \nAt CES, Amazon was part of a Toyota announcement evealing a self-driving food delivery vehicle called the e-Pallette, just a concept car for now. According to NBC News , Tim Collins, a vice president for Amazon Logistics, said that the partnership with Toyota allows Amazon to \"collaborate and explore new opportunities to improve the speed and quality of delivery for our customers.\" \nThe Wall Street Journal reported in April that Amazon has cobbled together a team of about a dozen people to work on driverless vehicles for delivery. And in January, Recode reported on a patent that was awarded to Amazon for autonomous cars navigating reversible lanes. Facebook Sheryl Sandberg speaks about overcoming grief and resilience at the Commonwealth Club in San Francisco. \nChief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg traveled to Germany in September to address the prestigious Frankfurt Motor Show, attended by Chancellor Angela Merkel . \n\"We're the only company in Silicon Valley that's not building a car,\" she quipped. \nAmong the big five tech companies, Facebook has perhaps the smallest role in the car itself, but Sandberg was in Frankfurt to talk about its sponsorship of a \"new mobility world,\" tying together the auto and tech industry. \nFacebook's research in virtual and augmented reality will potentially be used to give consumers a feel for the autonomous driving experience. It's all pretty vague right now. Intel Source: Mobileye A still image from a Mobileye video. \nThe chipmaker wants to become one of the world's biggest automotive suppliers. To that end, it acquired Mobileye for around $15.3 billion last year and partnered with Waymo to provide sensors and connectivity. \nMobileye, out of Israel, makes systems used for collision detection and other features in self-driving vehicles. Intel made a number of self-driving vehicle announcements at CES. It revealed that BMW, Nissan and Volkswagen all plan to use Mobileye technology to create \"high-definition maps\" that enable self-driving cars to get around safely. \nThe company is building a test fleet of 100 cars and showed off one of them at the show. The cars are equipped with twelve cameras, radar and laser scanners, and other chips, processors and systems developed by Intel and Mobileye. Oracle David Paul Morris | Bloomberg | Getty Images Larry Ellison, chairman of Oracle Corp., speaks during the Oracle OpenWorld 2016 conference in San Francisco, on Sunday, Sept. 18, 2016. \nFinding a role for Oracle in the self-driving revolution will be quite a stretch. The closest thing we've heard so far is co-founder and Chairman Larry Ellison refer to a \"self-driving database.\" \nIn a September earnings call with analysts, Ellison compared the database of the future with the car of the future. \n\"Self-driving cars eliminate the labor cost of driving, plus the high cost associated with human driving errors,\" he said. \"Self-driving database eliminates the labor cost of tuning, managing, and upgrading the database, thus avoiding all of the costly downtime associated with human error.\" \nIn other words, don't expect Oracle to drive you to and from work.
