Telia has said it planned to sell its assets in Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan, Georgia and Moldova. \nThe antitrust committee said that it was reviewing Kazakhtelecom’s application in a written reply to questions from Reuters. \nKazakhtelecom, the country’s biggest mobile operator with a market capitalisation of about $1 billion, was not available to comment. \nKazakhstan’s sovereign wealth fund has a 51.0 percent stake in Kazakhtelecom, part of which it plans to sell this year in its large-scale privatisation drive.
