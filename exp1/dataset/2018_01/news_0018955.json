Morgan Stanley is advising the start-up.\nBoxed Chief Executive Chieh Huang did not respond to an emailed request for comment. A Kroger spokeswoman said the company in general does not comment on rumor or speculation.\nForbes reported the news earlier on Friday.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-13T07:21:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-13T06:29:22.049+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
