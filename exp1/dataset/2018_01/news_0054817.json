A spokesman for the committee’s Republican chairman, Representative Devin Nunes, did not immediately respond to a request for comment. \nAgainst the wishes of Democrats, the Republican majority on the intelligence committee has been pushing for the release of a classified memo commissioned by Nunes that alleged surveillance abuse by the Federal Bureau of Investigation and Department of Justice. The committee voted along party lines to release the memo on Monday, leaving it to Trump to decide. \nDemocrats have criticized the memo as partisan talking points intended to cast doubt on the investigation. \nThe House intelligence panel is one of three congressional committees, along with Department of Justice Special Counsel Robert Mueller, investigating the matter. \nDuring his Jan. 16 appearance, Bannon refused to answer questions about his time in Trump’s administration or the post-election presidential transition, committee members said. \nThe White House and the House committee have so far not even begun to discuss the executive privilege issue, the source said. Bannon also has not received documents to review from the White House or Trump’s presidential transition office, the source said. \nWhite House communications director Hope Hicks, who also has been asked to appear before House Intelligence, is dealing with similar executive privilege issues, according to another person familiar with the matter.
