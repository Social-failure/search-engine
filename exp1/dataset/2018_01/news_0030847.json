We welcome the actions they are beginning to take and we encourage them to act with urgency,” Ramaphosa said. \nSouth Africa’s state prosecutor said on Wednesday it had served a court order on consulting firm McKinsey relating to a 1.6 billion rand ($130 million) contract with state utility Eskom it worked on with Trillian, a local company then controlled by associates of Gupta family, who are close to Zuma. \nZuma and the Guptas have consistently denied any wrong doing. \n“We want deal with the rot. It is unacceptable, totally unacceptable, that companies owned by the nation and set up to benefit the people, have been hijacked, captured, by certain interests,” Ramaphosa said in some of his strongest comments yet on a widening graft scandal that has shaken investor confidence. \nRamaphosa also admitted that reversing damaging ratings downgrades would be a “mammoth task”.
