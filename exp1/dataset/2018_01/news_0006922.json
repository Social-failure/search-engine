Boyle and his wife Caitlan Coleman were kidnapped in October 2012 while backpacking in Afghanistan. \nBoyle, 34, wearing an orange prison jumpsuit, appeared briefly by video link in an Ottawa court room on Monday. He is due to make his next appearance on Monday Jan. 15 at 0930 ET (1430 GMT). \nWhen they returned to Canada with three children born in captivity, Boyle said a fourth child had been murdered and his spouse raped after their capture by the Taliban-allied Haqqani network. The Taliban denied the accusations of rape and murder. \nThe court has imposed a publication ban that prevents media from reporting on information that could identify any victims or witnesses. The ban also prohibits reporting on the details of the bail hearing.
