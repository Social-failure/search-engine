His diplomatic career was cut short after the war and his actions remained largely unknown in Japan for decades after the conflict ended.\nMost of Lithuania’s Jewish population – about 200,000 people – were shot dead in first few months after Nazi Germany occupied its territory in June 1941, ending centuries of the thriving culture.\nReporting By Andrius Sytas; Editing by Niklas Pollard, Raissa Kasolowsky and David Evans\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-14T16:34:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-14T16:43:02.021+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
