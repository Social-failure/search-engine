Dec tweet \n\"There's always been a fear for players like an Amazon or a Google that something like this could actually get through,\" Daniel Ives, head of technology research at GBH Insights, told CNBC. \"We believe it's more noise than a real threat.\" show chapters 11:21 AM ET Fri, 29 Dec 2017 | 02:48 \nThere's been speculation that the president's shots at Amazon are aimed at Bezos , whose newspaper has published stories critical of the president. \nAmazon already collects sales tax on products it sells directly to consumers, but has faced challenges from states over its policy of allowing third-party vendors to charge varying levels of sales tax. \nThe issue has garnered more attention as Amazon continues to take a bigger share of overall retail sales. Amazon celebrated its \"biggest holiday\" shopping season at the end of last year. \nThere is an underlying movement among traditional brick-and-mortar retailers to more heavily tax Amazon, Ives said, so the discussion is \"something you have to keep an eye on.\" \nBut the likelihood that an internet tax would pass is small, he said. \n\"Listen they've [Amazon] significantly changed the retail landscape across the world,\" Ives said. \"I think it's more of the same where they're getting in the crosshairs.\" \nTrump spoke before media and members of the administration Wednesday evening during the signing of the Interdict Act, which seeks to reduce drug smuggling through the purchase of opioid sensors. \nAmazon did not immediately return a CNBC request for comment. \n—CNBC's Kevin Breuninger and Eugene Kim contributed to this report.
