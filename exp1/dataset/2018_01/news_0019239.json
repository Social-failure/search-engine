Vivendi also owns about 29 percent of Italy’s biggest private broadcaster Mediaset. \n“The deadline was Jan. 15 but there has been a postponement of two to three weeks to meet requests from funds,” one of the sources said. \nItalian infrastructure fund F2i is expected to make a bid, two sources said, adding that other funds might be interested. \nUnited States-based Discovery Channel, one of Persidera’s main clients, is considering a bid but its interest appears to be cooling. \n“The dossier is still on Discovery’s table, but interest is waning,” the sources said. \nIn October a source close to the matter said that Persidera was valued between 350 million euros ($425 million) and 400 million euros. \nIf few bidders emerge, TIM might opt to shelve the process for the time being, one of the sources said on Friday. \nAnother source said that Italian mast companies EI Towers and Rai Way would not be making offers for antitrust reasons but could forge alliances with F2i or other funds at a later date to manage the assets. \nBarclays is advising TIM while Lazard is advising Italian media group GEDI Gruppo Editoriale, which owns the other 30 percent. \nAll the companies involved declined to comment.
