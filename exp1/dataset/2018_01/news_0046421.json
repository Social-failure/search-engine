Options include spinning the loss-making service off into a separate company or selling it, analysts have said.\nSky has already warned regulators that they should not assume it will continue to fund Sky News if the takeover is blocked.\nChief Executive Jeremy Darroch told analysts after the company reported results on Thursday that Sky News was not as important as it was when Sky launched in 1989.\n“I wouldn’t describe Sky News as critical to the business today, indeed I wouldn’t really pick any part of our business and say it is critical,” he said.\n“If for any reason we didn’t have Sky News I don’t think that would be material, if you like, in terms of the direction of the business.”\nReporting by Paul Sandle; Editing by Adrian Croft\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-25T14:51:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-25T15:04:08.024+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
