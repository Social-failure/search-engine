REUTERS/Chris Helgren XRP allows banks and payment companies to send money quickly, no matter the location. Its transaction fee, at just “fractions of a penny”, is also comparable to bitcoin’s $30 per transaction fee.\nSeveral companies such as UBS ( UBSG.S ) and Santander ( SAN.MC ) already use Ripple’s products to enable payments. In November 2017, American Express Co ( AXP.N ) also launched an instant blockchain-based payment system using Ripple.\nChina's Ant Financial's deal to buy MoneyGram for $1.2 billion collapsed last week.
