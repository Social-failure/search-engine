The devolved government in Scotland also wants to retain membership of the EU’s single market and customs union and has tried to further the possibility of a differential deal.\nLike Gibraltar, Scotland voted to keep its EU membership while Britain as a whole voted to leave, straining relations between London and Edinburgh.\nReporting by Elisabeth O'Leary; editing by Michael Holden\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-01-30T20:15:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-30T16:31:28.018+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
