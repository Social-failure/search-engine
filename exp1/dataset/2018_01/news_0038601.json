However, in recent months prices have shown signs of faltering, especially in the capital, Stockholm.\nSwedish authorities as well as the European Commission and the IMF, have repeatedly warned the high debt levels are a serious threat to the economy.\nReporting by Stockholm Newsroom; editing by Niklas Pollard\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-01-23T16:48:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-24T15:26:43.004+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
