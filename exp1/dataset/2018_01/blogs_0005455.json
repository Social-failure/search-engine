It is all about him.\" Today tweet \nHe added that \"senior advisers, family members, every single one of them, questions his intelligence and fitness for office.\" Wolff says the book is based on more than 200 interviews with people around the president. \nIn a tweet Friday morning, Trump called the book a \"phony\" attempt to discredit him. On Thursday, White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders labeled it \"trash,\" \"fraudulent\" and \"tabloid gossip.\" \nDisclosure: CNBC and NBC are owned by Comcast.
