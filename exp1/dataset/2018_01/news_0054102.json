Perpetual bondholders would be offered $15 million, or less than 4 percent of face value.\nCreditors would end up owning 70 percent of the restructured company, management would get up to 20 percent, and existing shareholders would own just 10 percent.\nKey for Noble will be managing its debt payments in a fashion that allows them to trade profitably again.\nLast year, interest payments and the merchant’s risk of failure were seen as so high that counterparties and banks demanded steep premiums that led to steep losses for the company despite an improving commodity market environment.\nOn the back of the proposed restructuring, S&P cut Noble’s long-term corporate credit rating to CC from CCC- and gave it a negative outlook, while Moody’s cut the rating to Ca from Caa3.\n“If successful, the transaction will constitute a distressed debt exchange, which is a default event under Moody’s definition,” said Gloria Tsuen, a senior analyst at Moody‘s.\nMoody’s said a high level of uncertainty surrounds Noble’s ability to turn around its operations and return to profitability, given the challenging operating environment and the company’s weakened business profile.\nINVESTMENT FUNDS Noble did not name the creditors with whom it made the deal. A source said these included investment funds such as Och-Ziff Capital Management, Taconic Capital Advisors and Varde Partners.\nTaconic and Varde declined comment. There was no reply from Och-Ziff Capital.\n“The creditors are all savvy operators who will now be in the driver’s seat, which will raise the prospect of a turnaround,” said Tang from United First Partners.\n“Everyone involved has lost - (although) the distressed investors are best positioned when Noble turns around,” he said.\nNoble shares fell as much as 23 percent on Tuesday before ending 12 percent lower at 0.23 Singapore dollars, giving it a market value of just $263 million. That is in sharp contrast to a valuation of $6 billion that it commanded in February 2015.\nNoble was founded in 1986 by Richard Elman, who rode a commodities bull run to build the company into one of the world’s biggest traders, but it plunged into crisis in February 2015 when Iceberg Research started questioning its books. Noble has stood by its accounting.\nElman is Noble’s biggest shareholder with a stake of just over 18 percent. Other large investors include sovereign wealth fund China Investment Corp and Orbis Investment Management. Noble has been hemmed in by financing constraints - a major issue for trading houses - and it has lost many traders and analysts in recent years.\nThe proposed debt-for-equity deal has to be approved by regulators and Noble’s shareholders.\nReporting by Anshuman Daga; Additional reporting by Gloystein Henning; Editing by Tom Hogue and David Evans\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-01-30T14:37:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-30T08:40:49.010+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
