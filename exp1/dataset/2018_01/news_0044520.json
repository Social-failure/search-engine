Six co-conspirators received sentences ranging from five to 10 years, and another three accused were acquitted. \nIssoufou was elected in 2011, one year after a coup. He was re-elected in February 2016 with 92.5 percent of the vote, after the opposition coalition boycotted the polls. \n“This is not what we expected, but the court is sovereign and it judged that they conspired against the state,” lawyer Nabara Ycouba told a news conference. “The law does not allow for an appeal. I will discuss with my clients what to do.” Reporting by Boureima Balima; Writing by Tim Cocks; Editing by Gareth Jones", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-26T20:29:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-26T21:13:46.012+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
