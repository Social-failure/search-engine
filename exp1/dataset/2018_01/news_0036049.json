(“AMC” or the “Company”) (NYSE: AMC) on behalf of investors that acquired AMC securities in the February 8, 2017 Secondary Public Offering (“SPO”) or during the period from December 20, 2016 through August 1, 2017 (the “Class Period”), seeking recovery of damages for alleged violations of the federal securities laws. Pursuant to applicable law, investors have until March 13, 2018 to apply to the Court to be appointed as lead plaintiff in the lawsuit.\nOn November 30, 2016, AMC acquired Odeon and UCI Cinemas Holdings, and on December 21, 2016, AMC acquired Carmike Cinemas. Also on December 21, 2016, AMC filed a shelf Registration Statement with the SEC to permit the Company to offer and sell AMC common shares. The Complaint alleges that throughout the Class Period, Defendants failed to disclose that Carmike’s operations had been performing poorly.\nOn August 1, 2017, post-market, AMC announced worse-than-expected preliminary second quarter 2017 financial results due to a loss of market share that occurred during 2016 and the poor performance of acquired Carmike theaters.\nOn this news, AMC stock fell from $20.80 to close at $15.20 on August 2, 2017 (a decline of $5.60), or more than 50% below the price at which the shares were sold in the SPO.\nIf you purchased or otherwise acquired AMC securities, have information or would like to learn more about these claims, please contact Thomas Elrod of Kirby McInerney at 212-371-6600, or by filling out this contact form , to discuss your rights or interests with respect to these matters without any cost to you.\nKirby McInerney LLP is a New York-based plaintiffs’ law firm concentrating in securities, antitrust, whistleblower and consumer litigation.
