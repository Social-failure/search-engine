REUTERS/Kirill Kudryavtsev/Pool/File Photo Most astronauts “grow” during protracted space missions because their spines extend in the absence of gravity, but the gains are usually limited to a couple of centimeters (inches) maximum and disappear once they are back on the ground.\nThe 41-year-old Kanai, who went to space last month for a nearly six-month mission, posted on Twitter on Monday that he had “a big announcement.”\n“My height’s been measured here in space and somehow, somehow, I’ve grown 9 cm! In only three weeks I’ve really shot up, something I haven’t seen since high school,” he tweeted.\n“This makes me a little worried that I might not be able to fit in the Soyuz seats for our return.”\nBut a bit over a day later - and in the wake of a flurry of news stories - he apologised, saying that he’d measured himself after his captain raised questions about the apparent growth and he had stretched only 2 cm from his Earth-bound height.\n“This mis-measurement appears to have become a big deal, so I must apologise for this terrible fake news,” he tweeted, without explaining how the original miscalculation had occurred.\n“It appears I can fit on the Soyuz, so I‘m relieved.”\nReporting by Elaine Lies; Editing by Michael Perry\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-10T05:22:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-10T05:39:58.013+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
