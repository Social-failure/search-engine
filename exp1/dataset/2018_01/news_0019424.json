REUTERS/Christophe Archambault/Pool “The president spoke of the importance of preserving the Iran nuclear deal, and the necessity for all parties to the agreement to respect the commitments they made,” the Elysee statement said.\nThe telephone exchange took place on Friday, but it was not immediately clear whether it came before or after U.S. President Donald Trump gave the nuclear deal a final reprieve whilst warning European allies they had to work with him to “fix the terrible flaws” of the pact or face U.S. withdrawal.\nIran says its nuclear program is only for peaceful purposes and that it will stick to the accord as long as the other signatories respect it but will “shred” the deal if Washington pulls out.\nMacron says he wants an “uncompromising” dialogue with Iran about its ballistic missile program and he told Netanyahu that efforts concerning Iranian ballistics as well as its regional activities should continue.\nReporting by Richard Lough; Editing by David Gregorio\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-14T06:14:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-14T06:47:51.006+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
