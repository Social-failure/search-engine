They give safe haven to the terrorists we hunt in Afghanistan, with little help. No more!” \nThe announcement sent U.S. officials scrambling to suspend security assistance, later estimated at up to about $2 billion, to the nuclear-armed ally. \nPakistani officials were infuriated by the action. Its National Security Committee of senior civilian and military chiefs denounced it as “completely incomprehensible.” U.S. Ambassador David Hale was summoned to the foreign ministry for an explanation. \nPakistan is a crucial gateway for U.S. military supplies destined for U.S. and other troops fighting a 16-year-old war in neighbouring, landlocked Afghanistan. \nA senior Trump administration official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said on Jan. 5 that Washington hoped that the aid suspension would be enough to communicate its concern to Islamabad. \nBut the official cautioned that the freeze was also not the only tool that America had to pressure the country - suggesting it might resort to other measures, if needed. \n“We are considering many different things, not just the (financial) assistance issue,” the official said. \nThe United States has long blamed the militant safehavens in Pakistan for prolonging the war in Afghanistan, giving insurgents, including from the Haqqani network, a place to plot attacks and rebuild its forces. \n“We believe we owe it to the Americans in harm’s way in Afghanistan. We simply can’t ignore the sanctuaries if we are going to make progress in Afghanistan,” the official said.
