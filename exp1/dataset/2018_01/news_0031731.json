McGregor has not mounted a title defense in either weight class.\nHis only outing since beating Eddie Alvarez for the lightweight belt in November 2016 was a lucrative boxing match in August last year against the undefeated Floyd Mayweather, which the Irishman lost in the 10th round.\nReporting by Philip O'Connor; editing by Ken Ferris\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-20T01:26:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-20T01:49:12.023+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
