Landbauer says he did not know of the anti-Semitic and neo-Nazi content, since the book was published in 1997, well before he joined, and he had only seen copies with those passages redacted or pages torn out.\nThe Freedom Party has stopped short of forcing him out, saying he had assured it he did nothing wrong.\nIn Austria, right-wing student fraternities sometimes espouse ideas with echoes of Nazism, like the concept of an expanded Germany including Austria.\nAbout 40 percent of FPO members of parliament, several FPO ministers and numerous FPO ministry staff are members of such fraternities, according to Austria’s main Jewish body IKG.\nThe Freedom Party was founded by former Nazis in the 1950s but says it has abandoned Nazi ideology. It rails against Islam but denounces anti-Semitism and courts Jewish voters, with limited success.\nThe IKG has a policy of having no dealings with the Freedom Party or its ministers. It has also called on Landbauer to resign.\nIn a surprising twist, the Social Democrats (SPO) said they had expelled a member for having illustrated the same songbook after prosecutors placed him under investigation.\n“The person was excluded from the provincial party leadership as well as the SPO,” it said in a statement on Tuesday evening, without naming the individual.\nReporting by Francois Murphy; Additional reporting by Shadia Nasralla; Editing by Raissa Kasolowsky and Andrew Roche\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-31T15:46:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-31T16:00:14.055+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
