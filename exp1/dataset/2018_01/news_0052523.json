On Sunday, the first day after Prince Alwaleed’s release, it rocketed 10 percent. \nDuring his detention, the Saudi stock index rose over eight percent.

Fashion retailer Fawaz Abdulaziz Alhokair Co, which had jumped 6.8 percent on Sunday after some of its major shareholders were released in the corruption probe, fell back 2.5 percent. \nBut petrochemical firm Sipchem rose 1.7 percent after it estimated fourth-quarter net profit jumped to 164.4 million riyals ($43.8 million) from 31.9 million riyals, beating SICO Bahrain’s forecast of 154 million riyals and NCB Capital’s 135 million riyals. \nDubai’s index fell 0.3 percent but Bahrain-based financial services firm Ithmaar Holding rose to 0.76 dirham on its first day of trade in Dubai from a low of 0.67 dirham. \nIt was Dubai’s most heavily traded stock, seeing over 70 million shares change hands, almost of third of the market’s entire trading volume. Meanwhile, the company’s Bahrain-listed shares surged 8.3 percent to 19.5 U.S. cents, equivalent to 0.72 dirham. \nAbu Dhabi edged down 0.1 percent as Abu Dhabi National Energy retreated 3.5 percent. But Qatar’s index rose 0.4 percent as Qatar National Bank, the biggest lender, added 2.4 percent. HIGHLIGHTS \n* Index rose 0.4 percent to 7,568 points.
