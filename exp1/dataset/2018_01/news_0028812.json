HHS said the new division would focus on enforcing those laws.\nCritics said the division’s creation could encourage a broader range of religious objections, with a potentially strong impact on less-settled areas of the law like the status of gay and transgender individuals under anti-discrimination statutes.\nThe Supreme Court has put some limits on what constitutes a valid religious objection, saying the law does not protect “personal philosophical choices.”\nDENIAL OF ACCESS Jack Ende, president of the American College of Physicians, said the second-largest U.S. doctors group “would be particularly concerned if the new HHS division takes any actions that would result in denial of access to appropriate healthcare based on gender, gender identity, sexual orientation, race, ethnicity or other personal characteristics.”\nFederal law restricts the ability of doctors and hospitals to turn away people seeking emergency care. But healthcare providers who accept federal funds through programs like Medicare otherwise have broad latitude to refuse patients, provided they are not doing so on a discriminatory basis.\nWhile discrimination based on race, religion and sex are barred under federal law, recent court battles have focused on whether sexual orientation and gender identity are similarly protected. Trump’s Justice Department has said sexual orientation is not a protected category.\nUnder Democratic former President Barack Obama, HHS adopted a regulation that prohibited healthcare professionals from discriminating on the basis of gender identity. A federal judge in Texas last year blocked that regulation, saying it would require doctors to carry out gender-reassignment surgeries in violation of deeply held religious beliefs.\nSome of the leading hospital chains are Catholic. The Catholic Health Association of the United States said one in six patients in the country is treated in a Catholic hospital.\nLambda Legal, an advocacy group for lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people, already represents several transgender patients, including a New Jersey transgender man suing a Catholic hospital for allegedly denying a procedure related to his gender reassignment on religious grounds. Camilla Taylor, the organization’s acting legal director, said Lambda Legal is prepared to continue to bring such challenges.\nRobin Wilson, a professor at University of Illinois College of Law, said she thought the Trump administration was indicating it will side with those doctors or hospitals who refuse to perform gender-reassignment surgery.\nReligious objectors were encouraged by a 2014 Supreme Court decision that a federal requirement that family-owned companies pay for insurance coverage for women’s birth control violated a federal statute protecting religious freedom.\n“Conscience protections for health professionals and religious institutions, particularly in the abortion context, are long-standing and deeply rooted,” said Richard Garnett, a professor at Notre Dame Law School in Indiana.\n“To me, there should be nothing particularly surprising or troubling about an administration, this one or any other, deciding that the Civil Rights Division should allocate resources to make those protections meaningful,” Garnett added.\nReporting by Brendan Pierson and Jan Wolfe; Additional reporting by Andrew Chung in New York and Julie Steenhuysen in Chicago; Writing by Anthony Lin and Will Dunham\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-01-19T08:37:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-19T12:05:32.013+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
