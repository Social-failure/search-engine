This prompted the EU to cut duties to between 4.5 and 8.1 percent from initial rates of 22-25.7 percent.\nThe rates for Indonesia remain those set in 2013 - between 8.8 and 20.5 percent.\nThe General Court of the European Union, the second-highest EU court, also delivered a series of rulings in September 2016 to annul each set of duties in their present form.\nThe EU decided earlier this week to withdraw a planned appeal, although the actual withdrawal could take some time, allowing the EU to determine how to proceed.\nBoth countries impose an export duty on the raw material - soybeans for Argentina and palm oil for Indonesia - which the EU said means biodiesel producers in the two countries have lower costs than elsewhere, allowing them to “dump” product at unfairly low prices.\nThe EU had argued that the biodiesel markets in both countries were heavily regulated, so it needed to construct a “normal value” for the product, including a higher reference price for soybeans or palm oil and a reasonable profit margin.\nArgentina and Indonesia called the resultant five-year anti-dumping measures protectionist.\nThe WTO panel found, in line with the ruling for Argentina, that the EU should have used the prices recorded by the producers. It also found that the EU failed to calculate correctly a normal profit margin.\nIndonesia had wanted the panel to suggest how the EU should adapt its measures, arguing they should be withdrawn. However, the panel did not make specific recommendations.\nThe parties have 60 days to decide whether to appeal.\nReporting by Philip Blenkinsop; Editing by Robert-Jan Bartunek and Mark Potter\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-01-25T23:16:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-25T23:05:39.007+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
