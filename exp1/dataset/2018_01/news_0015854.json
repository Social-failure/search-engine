The SPD will now ask members to vote on whether they want to take that step.\nParty sources said they had agreed to a blueprint for formal coalition negotiations in a move that could ultimately end months of political deadlock in Europe’s largest economy after the election last September.\nFollowing is a summary of the main agreed policy areas:\nTAX/ECONOMY * Gradually abolish solidarity tax introduced after reunification in 1990 to support poorer eastern states, amounting to 10 billion euros ($12.12 billion) of tax relief for citizens.\n* Invest 5.95 billion euros in education, research and digitalization by 2021.\n* Stick to goal of balanced budget with no new debt.\nENVIRONMENT/CLIMATE * Recognize 2020, 2030 and 2050 climate goals.\n* Pass law to guarantee will stick to goal to cut carbon dioxide emissions by 55 percent by 2030.\n* Aim to get 65 percent of energy from renewable sources by 2030.\nMIGRATION * Manage and limit migration to Germany and Europe to prevent a re-run of the 2015 refugee influx.\n* Cap at 1,000 a month the number of people who will be allowed to join their family now living as refugees in Germany.\n* Specialist government commission should be set up to look at Germany’s ability to integrate migrants and report to the German lower house of parliament.\n* Focus on causes of migration rather than the migrants themselves.\n* Support a joint European asylum system that fairly distributes people in need of protection around the continent.\nEUROPE * Strengthen cohesion in Europe with Germany to play active role in debate on strengthening European integration.\n* Reject protectionism, isolationism and nationalism. Need more international cooperation.\n* EU needs to take leading role in climate protection internationally and in implementing the 2015 Paris deal aimed at slowing climate change.\n* Strengthen European Parliament and boost European Union’s finances - Germany would be prepared to pay more into the EU budget.\n* Strengthen Franco-German cooperation - Germany and France should be innovative and will show this with their intention to research artificial intelligence.\nFARMING * Agree ban on cultivating genetically modified plants nationwide.\n* Systematically and significantly limit use of weed killer glyphosate with the aim of entirely ending use of plant protection agents that contain this as quickly as possible.\n($1 = 0.8254 euros)\nReporting by Michelle Martin Editing by Jeremy Gaunt\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-01-12T18:57:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-13T14:45:46.062+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
