Ramey will lead engagements with large healthcare systems as the company continues to expand operations throughout the east coast and across the country. He previously held senior technology titles at PerformRX (a subsidiary of AmeriHealth Caritas), Penn Mutual Life Insurance, CIGNA Health Services, and Dendrite International.\nAs a nationally recognized healthcare technology executive, Terry says he was looking to make an impact on the provider side of the industry. \"At CIGNA, Penn Mutual, and other major payor organizations, my responsibilities were to leverage technology to positively affect the bottom line,\" says Ramey. \"At VertitechIT, I have the opportunity to help transform hospital IT departments with a direct impact on patient care. It's not often that an IT executive gets to do that.\"\nVertitechIT CEO Michael Feld agrees. \"Our work at work at major health systems goes far beyond designing and implementing cloud strategies, overhauling infrastructure, and streamlining operations. As an EPO, Terry will counsel clients on the IT initiatives that can literally change the way doctors do their jobs.\"\nWorking at the executive level within a healthcare organization, EPOs oversee a collaborative Office of the CTO (oCTO), implementing VertitechIT's proprietary LeverageITÂ© process. Working side by side with senior internal managers, the oCTO refines strategic directives and implements tactical solutions that make organizations more profitable and efficient.\nAbout VertitechIT: To label us \"Healthcare IT Consultants\" would be like calling a laptop a typewriter. In short, VertitechIT helps healthcare IT departments become more efficient, save money, and where possible, monetize their assets. We view technology as a means of helping doctors and nurses spend more time with their patients. Working with leadership at some of the most prestigious hospitals and health systems in the country, we exceed expectations by shattering the usual barriers that arise between client and consultant.
