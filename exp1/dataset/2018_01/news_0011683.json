However, the margin pressure is expected to start to ease towards the end of 2018 as a result of pricing and productivity actions that have been taken,” Kone said.\n“The margin decline in China is already a trend... But this profitability guidance looks somewhat more cautious than expected,” said Pekka Spolander, analyst at OP Equities who has a “reduce” rating on the stock.\nHe noted that Kone had dropped its routine of giving numerical profit guidance. The company said it would give a more precise business outlook in April at the latest.\nKone said last year it was planning to cut 1,000 jobs globally to save around 100 million euros ($119 million) annually by 2020.
