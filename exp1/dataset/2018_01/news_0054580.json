Authorities were investigating whether the attack was part of drug gang conflict.\nJusta told Agencia Brasil that the jail violence was a direct response by the Rio de Janeiro-based Red Command, Brazilâ€™s second-largest drug gang, to the Saturday shootings.\nPolice have made one arrest and named five more suspects in the Saturday shooting.\nReporting by Eduardo Simoes and Brad Brooks; Editing by Cynthia Osterman\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-29T23:08:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-29T23:16:28.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
