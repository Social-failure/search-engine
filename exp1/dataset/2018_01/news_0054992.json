Analysts polled by Reuters forecast an average 100,000-barrel build in crude stocks.\nThe date is due out at 10:30 a.m. EST (1530 GMT) on Wednesday.\n(Reporting by Aaron Sheldrick and Henning Gloystein; Editing by Richard Pullin and Kenneth Maxwell)", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-31T04:50:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-31T13:10:17.009+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
