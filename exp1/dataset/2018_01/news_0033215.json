I don’t want to kick out a baby,” the Frenchman snapped. \nKerber’s match against five-times grand slam champion Sharapova will be a duel of thirty-something players, and the German said she took heart from the longevity of tour veterans like Serena Williams and Roger Federer. \n“Yeah, getting older. I was waking up this morning, I say, ‘OK, the ‘2’ is gone right no,'” she said with a smile. \n”I‘m looking forward to the thirties ... I‘m feeling the same like yesterday. \n“I am feeling healthy. I‘m still fit. I am still enjoying my tennis. I‘m not looking too much about the age, just how I‘m feeling. I‘m still feeling young.” (Editing by Amlan Chakraborty)", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-18T11:21:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-18T11:51:24.009+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
