Delivering his speech before the crowd in flowing white African robes, he promised to deliver on the key promises of his campaign.\nReporting by James Giahyue; Writing by Joe Bavier; Editing by Tim Cocks\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-01-22T23:31:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-23T17:55:23.027+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
