( nyti.ms/2DTxV9t ) \nThe memo paints the investigation into Russiaâ€™s alleged meddling in the U.S. presidential election as tainted from the start, the paper said. \nThe Times report did not reveal the evidence Rosenstein relied on to authorize extension of the surveillance. \nRosenstein, also a Republican, took office in April after being nominated by Trump. \nThe Republican Party and the Democratic Party were not immediately available to comment late on Sunday. Reuters could not contact Carter Page for comment.
