A French-Canadian university student has been charged with murder in what Prime Minister Justin Trudeau called a “terrorist attack.”\nThe National Council of Canadian Muslims has called on Canadian governments to declare the day of the mosque shooting a day of remembrance and action on Islamophobia.\nQuebec Premier Philippe Couillard on Monday said he opposed such a designation. Trudeau has not said whether he would support it.\nReporting by Anna Mehler Paperny; Editing by Leslie Adler\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-01-16T03:57:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-15T22:12:35.015+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
