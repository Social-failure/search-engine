The administration is structuring the plan to encourage $1.35 trillion in state, local and private financing to build and repair the nation’s bridges, highways, waterworks and other infrastructure, one source said.\nThe U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the largest business lobbying group in Washington, is pushing for the administration to fund infrastructure projects and is even backing a 25 cent increase in the federal gasoline tax to make that happen, an official with the organization said.\nIt is unusual for a business group to call for a tax increase, but the Chamber argues that it is necessary to fund critical infrastructure projects. Tom Donohue, the Chamber’s president, is expected to make four recommendations in a speech on Thursday to reiterate its call for an infrastructure deal.\nThe numbers in the Trump plan are still in flux and could change before he unveils it. The prospects of winning approval in Congress are uncertain given that Republicans have only a 51-49 majority in the Senate.\nMany Republicans want to use private-sector investment to finance infrastructure projects to avoid increasing the national debt. Democrats believe that government money is necessary to produce such a large package.\nCOST-SHARING Under the Trump plan being shaped, the largest share of the federal money - $100 billion - is expected to go toward cost-sharing projects with local governments, similar to grants.\nThe goal would be to reduce the ratio of federal funding, which often now is 80 percent, by awarding funds only to projects that are able to provide more local funding or leverage private investment, said a business lobbyist familiar with the discussion.\nSome $50 billion would be earmarked for rural projects, the lobbyist said. Those funds would help governors on projects like roads, broadband access and replacing aging lead pipes. Including a pool for rural infrastructure could also reduce concerns among some Republican senators who fear rural areas may be unable to attract private investments.\nTwenty-five billion dollars would go toward existing federal infrastructure loan programs that seek to spur private investment, the lobbyist said.\nThe final $25 billion would be designated for so-called transformative projects - an effort being dubbed “American Spirit” projects. They could include high-speed trains or the Gateway Tunnel, the stalled proposal to build a new rail connection between New York City and New Jersey.\nThe plan may not deliver any additional federal money than in years past. The proposal could take $200 billion from existing spending plans – although the administration has not yet committed to whether it would come from existing programs or whether the money would be found elsewhere.\nThe administration is unlikely to rule out any forms of funding - including increasing the federal gas tax or creating a vehicle mileage tax, which would put electric cars that now use the roads but do not consume much gasoline on the same footing as cars with internal combustion engines, sources said.\nDonohue, the Chamber of Commerce president, is also expected to recommend expanding the ability of states to access private investment funds to complete projects, reducing the federal permitting process and addressing state and local permitting rules.\nHe will call for more federally backed workforce training - including creating an apprenticeship task force. As part of that, Donohue will reiterate the Chamber’s call for passing comprehensive immigration reform, a proposal where business has been at odds with the Trump administration.\nReporting by Ginger Gibson and David Shepardson; Editing by Damon Darlin and Peter Cooney\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-01-18T19:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-19T12:26:26.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
