(NYSE: C)\nThis press release features multimedia. View the full release here: http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180116005718/en/\nNET LOSS OF $18.3 BILLION ($7.15 PER SHARE)\nEXCLUDING THE ESTIMATED IMPACT OF TAX REFORM 7 ,\nNET INCOME OF $3.7 BILLION ($1.28 PER SHARE)\nREVENUES OF $17.3 BILLION\nRETURNED $6.3 BILLION OF CAPITAL TO COMMON SHAREHOLDERS IN THE\nFOURTH QUARTER AND $17.1 BILLION IN FULL YEAR 2017\nREPURCHASED 74 MILLION COMMON SHARES IN THE FOURTH QUARTER\nAND 214 MILLION IN FULL YEAR 2017\nBOOK VALUE PER SHARE OF $70.85\nTANGIBLE BOOK VALUE PER SHARE OF $60.40 8\nCitigroup Inc. today reported a net loss for the fourth quarter 2017 of $18.3 billion, or $7.15 per diluted share, on revenues of $17.3 billion. This compared to net income of $3.6 billion, or $1.14 per diluted share, on revenues of $17.0 billion for the fourth quarter 2016.\nThe net loss of $18.3 billion, or $7.15 per share, included an estimated one-time, non-cash charge of $22 billion, or $8.43 per share, recorded in the tax line within Corporate / Other, related to the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (Tax Reform) 7 . This charge is comprised of $19 billion related to the re-measurement of Citi’s deferred tax assets (DTA) arising from a lower U.S. corporate tax rate and shift to a territorial tax regime, and $3 billion related to the deemed repatriation of unremitted earnings of foreign subsidiaries. Excluding the impact of Tax Reform, net income of $3.7 billion increased 4% from the prior year period. Earnings per share increased 12% to $1.28, driven by the higher net income and a 7% reduction in average diluted shares outstanding. These results include a combined net benefit of roughly $0.08 per share, recorded in Corporate / Other, related to discrete items that resulted in a lower-than-expected tax rate, as well as a one-time loss in discontinued operations.\nCiti CEO Michael Corbat said, “While our fourth quarter results reflected the impact of a significant non-cash charge due to tax reform, the impact on our regulatory capital was much less significant. Tax reform does not change our capital return goals as we remain committed to returning at least $60 billion of capital in the current and next two CCAR cycles, subject to regulatory approval. Tax reform not only leads to higher net income and increased returns, but also serves to strengthen our capital generation capabilities going forward.\n“We closed this important year with strong operating earnings of $3.7 billion in the fourth quarter, or $1.28 per share. We grew loans across both our Consumer and Institutional franchises and we continue to see good progress across those products and geographies where we have been investing.\n“On an operating basis for the full year, we earned $15.8 billion in net income, which was nearly $1 billion more than 2016. And our earnings per share were $5.33, up 13% from 2016. We also made solid progress towards the targets we introduced during Investor Day in July. Revenue growth and strong expense management brought us to a full year Efficiency Ratio of 57.7%, an improvement of over 150 basis points from 2016. And our Return on Tangible Common Equity including and excluding DTA increased to 8.1% and 9.6%, respectively,” Mr. Corbat concluded.\nFor the full year 2017, Citigroup reported a net loss of $6.2 billion on revenues of $71.4 billion, compared to net income of $14.9 billion on revenues of $69.9 billion for the full year 2016. Excluding the impact of Tax Reform, Citigroup net income of $15.8 billion increased 6% compared to the prior year.\nThroughout the remainder of this press release, Citigroup and Corporate / Other’s net income and Citigroup’s effective tax rate are presented on a reported and adjusted basis, excluding the impact of Tax Reform. For additional information on this adjustment as well as other non-GAAP financial measures used in this release, see the Appendices and Footnotes to this release. Percentage comparisons are calculated for the fourth quarter 2017 versus the fourth quarter 2016, unless otherwise specified.\nCitigroup\n($ in millions, except as otherwise noted)\n4Q'17 3Q'17 4Q'16 QoQ% YoY% 2017 2016 %∆\nGlobal Consumer Banking 8,412 8,433 7,967 - 6% 32,697 31,519 4% Institutional Clients Group 8,097 9,231 8,184 (12)% (1)% 35,667 33,227 7% Corporate / Other 746 509 861 47% (13)% 3,085 5,129 (40)% Total Revenues $ 17,255 $ 18,173 $ 17,012 (5)% 1% $ 71,449 $ 69,875 2% Expenses $ 10,083 $ 10,171 $ 10,120 (1)% - $ 41,237 $ 41,416 - Net Credit Losses 1,880 1,777 1,696 6% 11% 7,076 6,561 8% Credit Reserve Build / (Release) (a) 165 194 64 (15)% NM 266 217 23% Provision for Benefits and Claims 28 28 32 - (13)% 109 204 (47)% Total Cost of Credit $ 2,073 $ 1,999 $ 1,792 4% 16% $ 7,451 $ 6,982 7% Income from Continuing Operations Before Taxes $ 5,099 $ 6,003 $ 5,100 (15)% - $ 22,761 $ 21,477 6% Provision for Income Taxes 23,270 1,866 1,509 NM NM 28,794 6,444 NM Income (Loss) from Continuing Operations $ (18,171 ) $ 4,137 $ 3,591 NM NM $ (6,033 ) $ 15,033 NM Net Income (Loss) from Discontinued Operations (109 ) (5 ) (3 ) NM NM (111 ) (58 ) (91)% Non-Controlling Interest 19 (1 ) 15 NM 27% 60 63 (5)% Citigroup Net Income (Loss) $ (18,299 ) $ 4,133 $ 3,573 NM NM $ (6,204 ) $ 14,912 NM Adjusted Net Income (b) $ 3,701 $ 4,133 $ 3,573 (10)% 4% $ 15,796 $ 14,912 6% Revenues North America 8,155 8,832 8,008 (8)% 2% 33,898 32,272 5% EMEA 2,393 2,655 2,605 (10)% (8)% 10,692 9,855 8% Latin America 2,329 2,429 2,206 (4)% 6% 9,368 8,899 5% Asia 3,632 3,748 3,332 (3)% 9% 14,406 13,720 5% Corporate / Other 746 509 861 47% (13)% 3,085 5,129 (40)% Income from Continuing Operations North America 1,756 1,977 1,687 (11)% 4% 7,242 6,733 8% EMEA 424 746 647 (43)% (34)% 2,804 2,365 19% Latin America 485 544 497 (11)% (2)% 2,103 2,087 1% Asia 885 969 775 (9)% 14% 3,560 3,294 8% Corporate / Other (21,721 ) (99 ) (15 ) NM NM (21,742 ) 554 NM EOP Assets ($B) 1,843 1,889 1,792 (2)% 3% 1,843 1,792 3% EOP Loans ($B) 667 653 624 2% 7% 667 624 7% EOP Deposits ($B) 960 964 929 - 3% 960 929 3% Common Equity Tier 1 Capital Ratio 12.3 % 13.0 % 12.6 % Supplementary Leverage Ratio 6.7 % 7.1 % 7.2 % Return on Average Common Equity (36.3 )% 7.3 % 6.2 % Book Value per Share $ 70.85 $ 78.81 $ 74.26 (10)% (5)% Tangible Book Value per Share $ 60.40 $ 68.55 $ 64.57 (12)% (6)% Note: Please refer to the Appendices and Footnotes at the end of this press release for additional information.
