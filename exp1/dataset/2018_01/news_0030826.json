Deutsch, CEO. \"Divesting Anchor will liberate capital for us, creating flexibility to reinvest in a more focused company, and the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act will result in a significantly lower effective tax rate going forward.\"\n\"Excluding the impact of these items, our Company showed a strong core earnings performance, generating $74.6 million of Operating Net Income in 2017 with an Operating Return on Average Common Equity of 10.1%. During 2017, we increased the tangible book value per share of our Company by 8%, and we raised the quarterly dividend on our common stock to $0.12 per share as of the first quarter of 2018.\"\nDivestiture\nDuring the fourth quarter, the Company entered into an agreement to sell its ownership interest in Anchor in a transaction that will result in Anchor being majority owned by members of its management team. The transaction is expected to close in the first quarter of 2018. Results attributed to Anchor’s performance remain consolidated in the Company’s results during current and prior periods. For presentation purposes, Anchor’s AUM is excluded from current and prior period AUM amounts, but is included in the calculation of Core Fees and Income. The Company has classified the assets and liabilities of Anchor as Held for Sale at December 31, 2017, which are included with Other Assets and Other Liabilities, respectively, on the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheet.\nCore Fees and Income/Assets Under Management\nTotal Core Fees and Income for the fourth quarter were $40.2 million, a 3% increase on a linked quarter basis and a 4% increase year-over-year. The increase reflects higher levels of AUM in the Wealth Management & Trust, Investment Management, and Wealth Advisory segments on both a linked quarter basis and year-over-year basis. Other Banking Fees decreased linked quarter due to lower loan fees, while increasing year-over-year due to increased BOLI income.\nAUM, excluding Anchor, was $21.2 billion at the end of the fourth quarter, an increase of 3% linked quarter and 13% year-over-year. The Company experienced net flows of $128 million during the fourth quarter of 2017. Net flows by segment were $79 million for Wealth Management & Trust, $20 million for Investment Management, and $29 million for Wealth Advisory.\nNet Interest Income\nNet Interest Income for the fourth quarter was $57.3 million, an increase of 1% from $56.6 million for the third quarter of 2017 and an increase of 11% from $51.5 million for the fourth quarter of 2016.\nNet Interest Margin was 3.04% for the fourth quarter of 2017, an increase of 2 basis points from the third quarter of 2017 and an increase of 16 basis points from the fourth quarter of 2016. Excluding interest recovered on previous nonaccrual loans, Net Interest Margin for the fourth quarter was 3.02%, flat from the third quarter of 2017 and an increase of 16 basis points from the fourth quarter of 2016.\nTotal Operating Expense\nTotal Operating Expense for the fourth quarter of 2017 was $94.0 million, up 36% linked quarter and 31% year-over-year. Notable expenses excluded from non-GAAP results include goodwill impairment charges of $24.9 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 and $9.5 million in the fourth quarter of 2016, and $0.4 of legal expense related to the divestiture of Anchor Capital in the fourth quarter of 2017.\nOn an operating basis (non-GAAP), Total Expense during the fourth quarter of 2017 was $68.7 million, a decrease of 1% linked quarter and an increase of 10% year-over-year.

The provision credit in the fourth quarter of 2017 was due to net recoveries and improved loss factors, partially offset by an increase in Criticized Loans and loan growth.\nCriticized Loans as of December 31, 2017 were $154.8 million, an increase of 6% linked quarter and an increase of 31% year-over-year. Nonaccrual Loans (“Nonaccruals”) as of December 31, 2017 were $14.3 million, an increase of 5% linked quarter and a decrease of 17% year-over-year.
