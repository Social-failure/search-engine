Jackson has also been charged with sexual assault and two other men face charges in connection with the same alleged incident. \nOpening the trial, Toby Hedworth, lawyer for the Public Prosecution Service, told Belfast’s Crown Court that the two Irish internationals engaged in sexual activity with the woman “against her wishes” in the early hours of June 28, 2016. \nHedworth said Jackson had “not sought her consent and indeed used force to achieve his aim”, and that Olding entered the bedroom while the complainant was being raped and joined in.

Neither of the players, who have represented their country a combined 29 times, will play at club or national level until the matter is concluded, the Irish Rugby Football Union has said.
