The bureau reportedly received a total of 235,094 complaints about financial services companies over the course of 2017. Of these, 30,576 complaints were about Equifax. \nWith the exception of North Dakota, Equifax was the source of the greatest number of complaints in all other 49 states and Washington, D.C. North Dakotans apparently foster more hatred for Experian, another credit-reporting agency, which received more complaints than Equifax in the state.
