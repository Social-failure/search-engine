He is fit for duty,” Jackson said. “I think he will remain fit for duty for the remainder of this term and even for the remainder of another (four-year) term if he’s elected.” Reporting by Ayesha Rascoe; Writing by Makini Brice; Editing by Bill Trott and Jonathan Oatis", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-01-17T04:58:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-16T23:16:00.035+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
