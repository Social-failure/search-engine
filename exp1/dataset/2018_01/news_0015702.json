Standard Chartered said investors should wait until late in the first quarter to buy into the sector, particularly zinc and copper, given net-long investor positioning, a typical first-quarter surplus and the likelihood of liquidation ahead of Lunar New Year. \"We think there is limited risk/reward for fresh long positions in the short term,\" Standard Chartered said in a report. \"We recommend that investors ... seek buying opportunities for some metals (on a fundamental basis) in the aftermath of any such Lunar New Year positioning consolidation.\" FUNDAMENTALS * COPPER: London Metal Exchange copper had edged up 0.1 percent to $7,110.50 a tonne by 0710 GMT, recovering from losses in the previous session when prices tipped their lowest since Dec. 22 at $7,086. * Shanghai Futures Exchange copper was flat at 54,800 yuan ($8,402) a tonne, having found support at the 100-day moving average of 53,180 yuan a tonne. * NICKEL: ShFE nickel rose to its highest in nearly two months at 100,900 yuan a tonne. A trader said he expects China's nickel imports to fall further after the country raised import taxes to 2 percent for 2018, from 1 percent last year. China's refined nickel imports slumped by 43.7 pct to under 200,000 tonnes in the first 11 months of 2017. * FORECASTS: The global economy is set to expand by 3.1 percent in 2018, slightly up from 3 percent last year and marking the first year since the 2008 Great Recession that it will near or achieve full growth potential, the World Bank said. * CHINA ECONOMY: China's producer prices rose at their slowest pace in 13 months in December, as the government's war against winter smog dented factory demand for raw materials in a sign the world's No.2 economy has started to slow. * ALUMINIUM: U.S. aluminium products makers sought new trade protections against Chinese imports on Tuesday, accusing China Zhongwang Holdings Ltd and its affiliates of evading U.S. anti-dumping and anti-subsidy duties by shipping aluminium products through Vietnam. * AUTO DEMAND: Potentially crimping metals demand, automakers in China face their weakest year of sales growth in at least two decades as a phasing out of tax cuts on smaller engine cars looks set to further dampen customer demand in the world's largest car market.
