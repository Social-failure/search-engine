I felt really comfortable, really relaxed out there”. \nOvernight leader Pieters needed four birdies on the front nine to stay ahead even as Briton Matt Fitzpatrick worked his way through the field. However, both players failed to replicate their form on the back nine, allowing Fisher to move ahead.

Just trying to hang on, felt like I played solid. \n“Fingers crossed, we’ll be paired again tomorrow, because it’s been three fun, exciting days... We’ll go out there tomorrow and hopefully have more fun.” \nPieters was happy despite not firing on the greens. ”I think I played pretty good today,“ he said. ”I missed a lot of putts today. Made a couple birdies early, which settled me down. \n“The back nine, I played good. But, yeah, I couldn’t really make a putt. Hit one really close on 16 and 17, 18, pretty disappointing. I didn’t hit many good shots there but it’s still nice to make a par on the last after the mess I made.” \nFitzpatrick, who shot a 63 to stand two off the pace at 15 under, was level in fourth place with holder Tommy Fleetwood.
