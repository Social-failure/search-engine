It operates around 14,000 cars in 26 cities in North America, western Europe and China.\nA smartphone displaying the DriveNow app with a map of Germany is held up next to a car from the DriveNow service in this picture illustration taken in Berlin, Germany, May 27, 2015. REUTERS/Stefanie Loos DriveNow is a joint venture between BMW and car rental firm Sixt ( SIXG.DE ) founded in 2011, which operates more than 6,000 vehicles in nine major European cities.\nThe Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung newspaper reported, without citing its sources, that both brands would keep their names, but their technology would be merged. It said a deal could be signed next month.\nA Daimler spokeswoman declined to comment on what she described as speculation. Representatives of BMW and Sixt were not immediately available to comment.\nReports of a possible merger first emerged more than a year ago, but the plan was rejected by Sixt. The FAZ said Sixt was close to agreeing to BMW buying part of its stake and brand rights.\nCar2Go’s customer numbers rose 30 percent in 2017 to almost 3 million, including 870,000 in Germany, while DriveNow’s rose by a quarter to 1 million users, including 720,000 in Germany.\nReporting by Edward Taylor, writing by Emma Thomasson; Editing by Kevin Liffey\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-23T20:14:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-23T20:31:20.030+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
