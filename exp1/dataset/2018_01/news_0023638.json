That was the lowest level seen in Africa’s top oil producer in at least 30 years. \n\"This round of attacks will be the most deadly and will be targeting the deep sea operations of the multinationals,\" it said in a statement on its website ( www.nigerdeltaavengers.org/ ). \nThe group, which wants a greater share of Nigeria’s energy wealth to go to the impoverished Delta region, said its targets would include Bonga Platform, Agbami, EA Field, Brittania-U Field, Akpo Field. In November, the group said it had ended a ceasefire. \nIn 2016 the Niger Delta Avengers bombed the Forcados sub-sea pipeline, a strike which involved the use of divers. \nSince January 2017 no substantial attacks have been carried out by any groups in the Delta, Nigeria’s southern oil production heartland.
