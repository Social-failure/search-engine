(Nasdaq: CREE) today announced financial results for its second quarter of fiscal 2018, ended December 24, 2017. Revenue for the second quarter of fiscal 2018 was $368 million, which represents an 8% decrease compared to revenue of $401 million for the second quarter of fiscal 2017 and a 2% increase compared to the first quarter of fiscal 2018. GAAP net income for the second quarter of fiscal 2018 was $14 million, or $0.14 per diluted share. This compares to GAAP net income of $6 million, or $0.06 per diluted share, for the second quarter of fiscal 2017. On a non-GAAP basis, net loss for the second quarter of fiscal 2018 was $1 million, or $0.01 per diluted share, compared to non-GAAP net income for the second quarter of fiscal 2017 of $30 million, or $0.30 per diluted share.\n“The second quarter results were within our targeted range, and we have made significant progress in our strategic assessment process,” stated Gregg Lowe, Cree CEO. “Over the last few months, I’ve traveled extensively to meet with customers, partners and employees, and I come away from that convinced there is meaningful upside for each of our businesses.”\nBusiness Outlook :\nFor its third quarter of fiscal 2018 ending March 25, 2018, Cree targets revenue in a range of $335 million to $355 million. GAAP net loss is targeted at $20 million to $26 million, or $0.20 to $0.26 per diluted share. Non-GAAP net income is targeted to be in a range of $3 million loss to a $3 million profit, or $0.03 loss per diluted share to $0.03 earnings per diluted share. Targeted non-GAAP income excludes $23 million of expenses, net of tax, related to stock-based compensation expense and the amortization or impairment of acquisition-related intangibles. The GAAP and non-GAAP targets do not include any estimated change in the fair value of Cree’s Lextar investment.\nQuarterly Conference Call:\nCree will host a conference call at 5:00 p.m. Eastern time today to review the highlights of the fiscal 2018 second quarter results and the fiscal 2018 third quarter business outlook, including significant factors and assumptions underlying the targets noted above.\nThe conference call will be available to the public through a live audio web broadcast via the internet.

This press release contains involving risks and uncertainties, both known and unknown, that may cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated in the . Actual results, including with respect to our targets and prospects, could differ materially due to a number of factors, including the risk that we may not obtain sufficient orders to achieve our targeted revenues; price competition in key markets; the risk that we or our channel partners are not able to develop and expand customer bases and accurately anticipate demand from end customers, which can result in increased inventory and reduced orders as we experience wide fluctuations in supply and demand; the risk that our commercial Lighting results will continue to suffer if new issues arise regarding issues related to product quality for this business; the risk that we may experience production difficulties that preclude us from shipping sufficient quantities to meet customer orders or that result in higher production costs and lower margins; our ability to lower costs; the risk that our results will suffer if we are unable to balance fluctuations in customer demand and capacity, including bringing on additional capacity on a timely basis to meet customer demand; the risk that longer manufacturing lead times may cause customers to fulfill their orders with a competitor's products instead; product mix; risks associated with the ramp-up of production of our new products, and our entry into new business channels different from those in which we have historically operated; the risk that customers do not maintain their favorable perception of our brand and products, resulting in lower demand for our products; the risk that our products fail to perform or fail to meet customer requirements or expectations, resulting in significant additional costs, including costs associated with warranty returns or the potential recall of our products; the risk that retail customers may alter promotional pricing, increase promotion of a competitor's products over our products or reduce their inventory levels, all of which could negatively affect product demand; the risk that our investments may experience periods of significant stock price volatility causing us to recognize fair value losses on our investment; the risk posed by managing an increasingly complex supply chain that has the ability to supply a sufficient quantity of raw materials, subsystems and finished products with the required specifications and quality; ongoing uncertainty in global economic conditions, infrastructure development or customer demand that could negatively affect product demand, collectability of receivables and other related matters as consumers and businesses may defer purchases or payments, or default on payments; the risk we may be required to record a significant charge to earnings if our goodwill or amortizable assets become impaired; our ability to complete development and commercialization of products under development, such as our pipeline of improved LED chips, LED components, LED lighting products, and Wolfspeed products; risks resulting from the concentration of our business among few customers, including the risk that customers may reduce or cancel orders or fail to honor purchase commitments; risks related to our multi-year warranty periods for LED lighting products; risks associated with acquisitions, divestitures, joint ventures or investments generally; the rapid development of new technology and competing products that may impair demand or render our products obsolete; the potential lack of customer acceptance for our products; risks associated with ongoing litigation; and other factors discussed in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), including our report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 25, 2017, and subsequent reports filed with the SEC.

CREE, INC.\nUNAUDITED FINANCIAL RESULTS BY OPERATING SEGMENT\n(in thousands, except percentages)\nThe following table reflects the results of the Company's reportable segments as reviewed by the Company's Chief Executive Officer, its Chief Operating Decision Maker or CODM, for the three and six months ended December 24, 2017 and the three and six months ended December 25, 2016. The CODM does not review inter-segment transactions when evaluating segment performance and allocating resources to each segment. As such, total segment revenue is equal to the Company's consolidated revenue.\nThree Months Ended December 24,\n2017 December 25,\n2016 Change Lighting Products revenue $144,616 $208,924 ($64,308 ) (31 )% Percent of revenue 39 % 52 % LED Products revenue 152,682 138,038 14,644 11 % Percent of revenue 42 % 34 % Wolfspeed revenue 70,572 54,364 16,208 30 % Percent of revenue 19 % 14 % Total revenue $367,870 $401,326 ($33,456 ) (8 )% Six Months Ended December 24,\n2017 December 25,\n2016 Change Lighting Products revenue $294,340 $392,760 ($98,420 ) (25 )% Percent of revenue 40 % 51 % LED Products revenue 297,202 275,531 21,671 8 % Percent of revenue 41 % 36 % Wolfspeed revenue 136,726 104,268 32,458 31 % Percent of revenue 19 % 13 % Total revenue $728,268 $772,559 ($44,291 ) (6 )% Three Months Ended December 24,\n2017 December 25,\n2016 Change Lighting Products gross profit $22,964 $74,770 ($51,806 ) (69 )% Lighting Products gross margin 15.9 % 35.8 % LED Products gross profit 38,606 40,314 (1,708 ) (4 )% LED Products gross margin 25.3 % 29.2 % Wolfspeed gross profit 34,133 25,911 8,222 32 % Wolfspeed gross margin 48.4 % 47.7 % Unallocated costs (3,100 ) (4,859 ) 1,759 (36 )% Depreciation and amortization adjustment — 4,431 (4,431 ) (100 )% Consolidated gross profit $92,603 $140,567 ($47,964 ) (34 )% Consolidated gross margin 25.2 % 35.0 % Six Months Ended December 24,\n2017 December 25,\n2016 Change Lighting Products gross profit $54,847 $124,060 ($69,213 ) (56 )% Lighting Products gross margin 18.6 % 31.6 % LED Products gross profit 77,416 82,084 (4,668 ) (6 )% LED Products gross margin 26.0 % 29.8 % Wolfspeed gross profit 66,531 49,371 17,160 35 % Wolfspeed gross margin 48.7 % 47.4 % Unallocated costs (5,859 ) (9,618 ) 3,759 (39 )% Depreciation and amortization adjustment — 4,601 (4,601 ) (100 )% Consolidated gross profit $192,935 $250,498 ($57,563 ) (23 )% Consolidated gross margin 26.5 % 32.4 % For the three and six months ended December 25, 2016, the Wolfspeed segment was presented as discontinued operations. The depreciation and amortization adjustment in the table above represents the depreciation and amortization that would have been recognized had the Wolfspeed assets been continuously classified as held and used. These costs were allocated to the reportable segment's gross profit for the three and six months ended December 25, 2016 because they represent an adjustment which provides comparability to the current period.\nReportable Segments Description\nThe Company's Lighting Products segment primarily consists of LED lighting systems and lamps. The Company's LED Products segment includes LED chips and LED components. The Company's Wolfspeed segment includes power devices, RF devices, and SiC materials.\nFinancial Results by Reportable Segment\nThe Company's CODM reviews gross profit as the lowest and only level of segment profit. As such, all items below gross profit in the consolidated statements of income (loss) must be included to reconcile the consolidated gross profit presented in the preceding table to the Company's consolidated loss before taxes.\nThe Company allocates direct costs and indirect costs to each segment's cost of revenue. The allocation methodology is based on a reasonable measure of utilization considering the specific facts and circumstances of the costs being allocated.\nCertain costs are not allocated when evaluating segment performance. These unallocated costs consist primarily of manufacturing employees' stock-based compensation, expenses for profit sharing and quarterly or annual incentive plans and matching contributions under the Company's 401(k) Plan.\nNon-GAAP Measures of Financial Performance\nTo supplement the Company's consolidated financial statements presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP, Cree uses non-GAAP measures of certain components of financial performance. These non-GAAP measures include non-GAAP gross margin, non-GAAP operating income, non-GAAP non-operating income, net, non-GAAP net income, non-GAAP diluted (loss) earnings per share and free cash flow.\nReconciliation to the nearest GAAP measure of all historical non-GAAP measures included in this press release can be found in the tables included with this press release. In this press release, Cree also presents its target for non-GAAP expenses, which are expenses less expenses in the various categories described below. Both our GAAP targets and non-GAAP targets do not include any estimated changes in the fair value of our Lextar investment.\nNon-GAAP measures presented in this press release are not in accordance with or an alternative to measures prepared in accordance with GAAP and may be different from non-GAAP measures used by other companies. In addition, these non-GAAP measures are not based on any comprehensive set of accounting rules or principles. Non-GAAP measures have limitations in that they do not reflect all of the amounts associated with Cree's results of operations as determined in accordance with GAAP. These non-GAAP measures should only be used to evaluate Cree's results of operations in conjunction with the corresponding GAAP measures.\nCree believes that these non-GAAP measures, when shown in conjunction with the corresponding GAAP measures, enhance investors' and management's overall understanding of the Company's current financial performance and the Company's prospects for the future, including cash flows available to pursue opportunities to enhance shareholder value. In addition, because Cree has historically reported certain non-GAAP results to investors, the Company believes the inclusion of non-GAAP measures provides consistency in the Company's financial reporting.\nFor its internal budgeting process, and as discussed further below, Cree's management uses financial statements that do not include the items listed below and the income tax effects associated with the foregoing. Cree's management also uses non-GAAP measures, in addition to the corresponding GAAP measures, in reviewing the Company's financial results.\nCree excludes the following items from one or more of its non-GAAP measures when applicable:\nStock-based compensation expense. This expense consists of expenses for stock options, restricted stock, performance stock awards and employee stock purchases through its ESPP. Cree excludes stock-based compensation expenses from its non-GAAP measures because they are non-cash expenses that Cree does not believe are reflective of ongoing operating results.\nAmortization or impairment of acquisition-related intangibles. Cree incurs amortization or impairment of acquisition-related intangibles in connection with acquisitions. Cree excludes these items because they arise from Cree's prior acquisitions and have no direct correlation to the ongoing operating results of Cree's business.\nLED business restructuring charges or gains. In June 2015, Cree’s board of directors approved a plan to restructure the LED business. The restructuring, which was completed during fiscal 2016, reduced excess capacity and overhead in order to improve the cost structure moving forward. The components of the restructuring included the planned sale or abandonment of certain manufacturing equipment, facility consolidation and the elimination of certain positions. Because these charges relate to assets which have been retired prior to the end of their estimated useful lives and severance costs for eliminated positions, Cree does not consider these charges to be reflective of ongoing operating results. Similarly, Cree does not consider realized gains or losses on the sale of assets relating to the restructuring to be reflective of ongoing operating results.\nNet changes associated with equity investment. The Company's common stock ownership investment in Lextar Electronics Corporation is accounted for utilizing the fair value option. As such, changes in fair value are recognized in income, including fluctuations due to the exchange rate between the New Taiwan Dollar and the United States Dollar. Cree excludes the impact of these gains or losses from its non-GAAP measures because they are non-cash impacts that Cree does not believe are reflective of ongoing operating results. Additionally, Cree excludes the impact of dividends received on its Lextar investment as Cree does not believe it is reflective of ongoing operating results.\nTransaction costs associated with the terminated sale of the Wolfspeed business. The Company incurred transaction costs in fiscal 2017 in conjunction with the previously proposed sale of its Wolfspeed business to Infineon. Because these costs were incurred relative to a portion of the business which was previously reported as discontinued operations in fiscal 2017, Cree does not consider these amounts to be reflective of ongoing operating results.\nSeverance pay associated with termination of key executive personnel. The Company incurred costs in fiscal 2018 in conjunction with the termination of key executive personnel. Cree excludes these items because they have no direct correlation to the ongoing operating results of Cree's business.\nIncome tax effects of the foregoing non-GAAP items. This amount is used to present each of the amounts described above on an after-tax basis consistent with the presentation of non-GAAP net income. Non-GAAP net income is presented using a non-GAAP tax rate. The Company’s non-GAAP tax rate represents a recalculation of the GAAP tax rate reflecting the exclusion of the non-GAAP items.\nCree expects to incur many of these same expenses, including income taxes associated with these expenses, in future periods. In addition to the non-GAAP measures discussed above, Cree also uses free cash flow as a measure of operating performance and liquidity. Free cash flow represents operating cash flows less net purchases of property and equipment and patent and licensing rights. Cree considers free cash flow to be an operating performance and a liquidity measure that provides useful information to management and investors about the amount of cash generated by the business after the purchases of property and equipment, a portion of which can then be used to, among other things, invest in Cree's business, make strategic acquisitions, strengthen the balance sheet and repurchase stock. A limitation of the utility of free cash flow as a measure of operating performance and liquidity is that it does not represent the residual cash flow available to the company for discretionary expenditures, as it excludes certain mandatory expenditures such as debt service.\nCREE, INC.\nUnaudited Reconciliation of GAAP to Non-GAAP Measures\n(in thousands, except per share amounts and percentages)\nNon-GAAP Gross Margin\nThree Months Ended Six Months Ended December 24,\n2017 December 25,\n2016 December 24,\n2017 December 25,\n2016 GAAP gross profit $92,603 $140,567 $192,935 $250,498 GAAP gross margin percentage 25.2 % 35.0 % 26.5 % 32.4 % Adjustment: Stock-based compensation expense 1,898 2,978 3,673 5,783 Non-GAAP gross profit $94,501 $143,545 $196,608 $256,281 Non-GAAP gross margin percentage 25.7 % 35.8 % 27.0 % 33.2 % Non-GAAP Operating (Loss) Income Three Months Ended Six Months Ended December 24,\n2017 December 25,\n2016 December 24,\n2017 December 25,\n2016 GAAP operating (loss) income ($26,303 ) $19,507 ($40,411 ) $14,300 GAAP operating (loss) income percentage (7.2 )% 4.9 % (5.5 )% 1.9 % Adjustments: Stock-based compensation expense: Cost of revenue, net 1,898 2,978 3,673 5,783 Research and development 1,999 2,486 4,456 5,925 Sales, general and administrative 8,129 6,742 14,031 15,148 Total stock-based compensation expense 12,026 12,206 22,160 26,856 Amortization or impairment of acquisition-related intangibles 6,792 5,937 13,584 12,345 LED business restructuring charges — 13 — 20 Transaction costs related to the terminated sale of the Wolfspeed business — 2,976 — 4,972 Executive Severance 4,880 — 4,880 — 23,698 21,132 40,624 44,193 Non-GAAP operating (loss) income ($2,605 ) $40,639 $213 $58,493 Non-GAAP operating (loss) income percentage (0.7 )% 10.1 % — % 7.6 % Non-GAAP Non-Operating Income (Loss), net Three Months Ended Six Months Ended December 24,\n2017 December 25,\n2016 December 24,\n2017 December 25,\n2016 GAAP non-operating income (loss), net $26,729 ($4,760 ) $25,662 ($4,919 ) Adjustment: Net changes associated with equity method investment (25,219 ) 4,735 (22,151 ) 5,849 Non-GAAP non-operating income (loss), net $1,510 ($25 ) $3,511 $930 Non-GAAP Net Income Three Months Ended Six Months Ended December 24,\n2017 December 25,\n2016 December 24,\n2017 December 25,\n2016 GAAP net income (loss) $13,721 $6,216 ($6,136 ) $6,783 Adjustments: Stock-based compensation expense 12,026 12,206 22,160 26,856 Amortization or impairment of acquisition-related intangibles 6,792 5,937 13,584 12,345 LED business restructuring charges — 13 — 20 Transaction costs related to the terminated sale of the Wolfspeed business — 2,976 — 4,972 Executive Severance 4,880 — 4,880 — Net changes associated with equity method investment (25,219 ) 4,735 (22,151 ) 5,849 Total adjustments to GAAP net (loss) income before provision for income taxes (1,521 ) 25,867 18,473 50,042 Income tax effect (12,864 ) (2,152 ) (8,890 ) (7,504 ) Non-GAAP net (loss) income ($664 ) $29,931 $3,447 $49,321 Non-GAAP Earnings per share Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share ($0.01 ) $0.30 $0.03 $0.49 Shares used in non-GAAP diluted earnings per share calculation Non-GAAP shares used 100,763 98,730 98,499 99,994 Free Cash Flow Three Months Ended Six Months Ended December 24,\n2017 December 25,\n2016 December 24,\n2017 December 25,\n2016 Cash flows from operations $51,689 $101,618 $105,812 $119,716 Less: PP&E spending (48,772 ) (15,874 ) (85,222 ) (35,211 ) Less: Patents spending (2,456 ) (3,584 ) (4,932 ) (5,836 ) Total free cash flow $461 $82,160 $15,658 $78,669\nView source version on businesswire.com : http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180123006455/en/\nCree, Inc.\nRaiford Garrabrant, 919-407-7895\nDirector, Investor Relations\ninvestorrelations@cree.com\nSource: Cree, Inc.", "external_links": ["http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180123006455/en/", "http://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=http%3A%2F%2Finvestor.cree.com%2Fresults.cfm&esheet=51747610&newsitemid=20180123006455&lan=en-US&anchor=investor.cree.com%2Fresults.cfm&index=2&md5=e62031f8a8e8f3d6175293071e3c06a0", "http://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=http%3A%2F%2Finvestor.cree.com%2Fevents.cfm&esheet=51747610&newsitemid=20180123006455&lan=en-US&anchor=investor.cree.com%2Fevents.cfm&index=1&md5=8aac25119b45398e8fe9415cbcdae71d", "http://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.cree.com&esheet=51747610&newsitemid=20180123006455&lan=en-US&anchor=www.cree.com&index=3&md5=2a798ae4af360082d5194aa4f201f1c3"], "published": "2018-01-24T00:01:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-24T00:53:15.001+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
