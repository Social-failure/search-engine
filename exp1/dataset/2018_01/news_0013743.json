( lat.ms/2rfbVAU ) \nThe Weinstein Company has been looking for a buyer or rescue financing since last fall as the studio continues to grapple with the fallout of sexual harassment allegations against former co-chairman, Harvey Weinstein, who left the company three months ago. \nThe companyâ€™s investment bankers at Moelis & Co have been focused on an outright sale, rather than a debt restructuring or bankruptcy. \nOn Monday, Killer Content Inc, the movie producer that has partnered with philanthropist Abigail Disney in a consortium vying to acquire the Weinstein Company, said a bankruptcy may be the best way forward for the embattled U.S. film and TV studio. \nBoth Miramax and Weinstein Co could not be immediately reached for a comment.
