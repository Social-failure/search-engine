Dozens of Russians were banned from competing at the Rio Olympics for the same reason.\nThe International Olympic Committee (IOC) last month banned Russia from the Pyeongchang Winter Olympics over what it called the “systematic manipulation” of the anti-doping testing system at the 2014 Sochi Games.\nBut the IOC left the door open for athletes without a history of doping to compete at its invitation as “Olympic Athletes from Russia” without the Russian tricolor, national emblems or anthem.\nThe Pyeongchang Paralympic Winter Games take place from March 9 to 18.\nReporting by Gabrielle Tétrault-Farber; Editing by Andrew Heavens\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-29T12:04:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-29T12:20:43.015+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
