That compares to 66 percent for women diagnosed in India.\nWithin Europe, five-year breast cancer survival increased to at least 85 percent in 16 countries including Britain, compared with 71 percent in Eastern Europe.\nThe researchers noted that in some parts of the world, estimation of survival is limited by incomplete data and by legal or administrative obstacles to updating the cancer records with a patient’s date of death. In Africa, they said, as many as 40 percent of patient records did not have full follow-up data, so survival trends could not be systematically assessed.\nReporting by Kate Kelland; editing by Ralph Boulton\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-31T01:33:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-31T01:59:47.021+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
