Analysts expect sales to increase further as more companies across the globe unveil plans to enter the bitcoin industry or blockchain technology. \nInvestors are excited about the future. AMD shares were up about 6 percent on Wednesday, while Nvidia’s stock rose 3 percent to a record. \nBitcoin, the most popular cryptocurrency, soared more than 1,300 percent in 2017, luring more people across the world to mine the currency, pushing up demand for GPUs. \nIn the past, AMD and Nvidia tried to tame expectations about potential revenue growth from cryptocurrency, but analysts see the floodgates opening for blockchain.
