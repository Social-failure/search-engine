GMP has also helped raise money for miners of digital currencies, which have also soared in recent months.\nIn addition to increased underwriting in the most recent quarter, small brokers could also have benefited from the investor trading of pot stocks in the secondary market as well as the potential increase in value of any warrants they hold.\nCompensating the underwriters with warrants can help lower the cost of financing for some pot companies who are growing and short of cash, said Skipp.\nAn underwriting agreement for Aurora Cannabis from October shows that Canaccord, the lead underwriter, and other participating brokers were granted options that would give them the right for a period of three years to purchase the shares of the company at the transaction's offering price, which was C$3. Shares of Aurora were trading at around C$14 on Monday.\n\"To the extent that you want to buy a business that is pretty transparent, with proper cash flows and a business that you understand and like, some of these independent brokers could be a play on the kind of activity that has been going on,\" said Diana Avigdor, head of trading at Barometer Capital Management.\nIt remains unclear how many of Canada's biggest banks will eventually participate in the market. Those that do could target the more established producers, rather than the many smaller, potentially riskier ones.\nThe 2018 financing pipeline has already got off to a brisk start, including the equity offering from Canopy Growth and a C$200 million issue of convertible debentures by Aurora Cannabis, that was led by Canaccord.\n\"Obviously there is a healthy market here for companies that raise money,\" said Vahan Ajamian, an equity research analyst covering the cannabis sector at Beacon Securities. \"I don't see that shrinking any time soon.\"\nWATCH: Pot legalization grows, but new regulations threaten businesses show chapters Pot legalization grows, but new regulations threaten businesses 5:43 PM ET Fri, 19 Jan 2018 | 02:11", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-23T00:31:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-23T00:45:28.010+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
