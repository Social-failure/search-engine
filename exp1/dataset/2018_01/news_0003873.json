The composite new orders index climbed to 58.0 last month — its highest since July 2007 — from 57.3. That demand pushed companies to add staff; hiring growth matched a 17-year record high set in November.\nEuro zone unemployment peaked at 12.1 percent in the first half of 2013. It has now declined to 8.8 percent.\nThe services PMI, which is part of the composite, soared to its highest in more than six years, 56.6, up from 56.2 in November. That followed a report on Tuesday showing the manufacturing PMI climbed to its highest in more than two decades of survey data .\nBut price pressure eased, a disappointing development for the ECB, which has been struggling to boost inflation. The rate of increases in input costs and what business charge consumers slowed for the first time in five months. Still, inflationary pressures remain at levels not seen in over six years.\n\"Based on past experience, the extent to which demand appears to be outstripping supply for many goods and services suggests that inflationary pressures could continue to build in the coming months,\" noted Williamson.\n\"A big question for 2018 will therefore be whether relatively high unemployment and spare capacity in many countries will continue to hold down pay growth and keep a ceiling on consumer price inflation.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-04T12:45:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-04T12:46:26.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
