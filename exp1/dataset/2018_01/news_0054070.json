(BNC or the Company) (OTCQX Markets: BNCC), which operates community banking and wealth management businesses in North Dakota, Arizona and Minnesota, and has mortgage banking offices in Illinois, Kansas, Missouri, Minnesota, Arizona and North Dakota, today reported financial results for the fourth quarter ended December 31, 2017.\nNet income in the fourth quarter of 2017 was $329 thousand, compared with $1.447 million in the same period of 2016. Fourth quarter 2017 diluted earnings per share was $0.09, compared to $0.41 in the fourth quarter of 2016. The fourth quarter of 2017 includes a $1.208 million income tax expense to revalue net deferred tax assets as a result of tax reform, as well as the sale of certain securities at a pre-tax loss of $495 thousand timed to maximize federal income tax deductibility. Excluding these events linked to tax reform, BNC's fourth quarter net income would have been $1.8 million, or $0.51 per diluted share (see table below). The fourth quarter 2017 earnings (excluding the tax reform related impacts) reflect higher net interest income and lower non-interest expenses, partially offset by lower non-interest income.\nNet interest income in the 2017 fourth quarter increased by $423 thousand, or 6.4%, from the same quarter in 2016, due primarily to the growth of loans held for investment and higher yields and balances on investment securities.\nNon-interest income in the fourth quarter of 2017 decreased by $457 thousand, or 9.4%, from the same period in 2016, primarily due to lower mortgage banking revenues and securities losses, partially offset by a gain on the sale of a bank branch which aggregated $864 thousand.\nNon-interest expense in the fourth quarter of 2017 decreased $450 thousand, or 4.5%, compared to the fourth quarter of the prior year due to decreases in costs related to mortgage banking activities and professional services.\nThe provision for credit losses was $100 thousand in the fourth quarter of 2017 and $0 in the fourth quarter of 2016. The ratio of nonperforming assets to total assets decreased to 0.21% at December 31, 2017, from 0.29% at December 31, 2016. The allowance for loan losses was 1.84% of loans held for investment at December 31, 2017, compared to 2.00% at December 31, 2016.\nBook value per common share at December 31, 2017 rose to $22.40 from $21.47 at December 31, 2016. Excluding accumulated other comprehensive income, book value per common share at December 31, 2017 was $22.38 compared to $20.98 at December 31, 2016.\nImpact of Tax Reform\nThe Company is providing adjusted earnings, a non-GAAP measure, in addition to reported results prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (\"GAAP\") in order to present financial information without the impact of actions linked to the new tax law. The following table reconciles the net income as prepared in accordance with GAAP to our determination of adjusted earnings (non-GAAP):\nFor the Quarter\nEnded December 31,\nFor the Twelve Months\nEnded December 31,\n(In thousands, except per share data)\n2017\n2016\n2017\n2016\nNet income (GAAP)\n$\n329\n$\n1,447\n$\n4,878\n$\n7,156\nRevaluation of net deferred tax assets\n1,208\n-\n1,208\n-\nLosses on sales of securities sold, net of tax\n307\n-\n307\n-\nAdjusted earnings (non-GAAP)\n$\n1,844\n$\n1,447\n$\n6,393\n$\n7,156\nADJUSTED EARNINGS PER SHARE DATA\nBasic earnings per common share (non-GAAP)\n$\n0.53\n$\n0.42\n$\n1.84\n$\n2.08\nDiluted earnings per common share (non-GAAP)\n$\n0.52\n$\n0.41\n$\n1.81\n$\n2.03\nADJUSTED KEY RATIOS (1)\nReturn on average common stockholders' equity (non-GAAP)\n9.33%\n7.97%\n8.46%\n10.35%\nReturn on average assets (non-GAAP)\n0.75%\n0.62%\n0.66%\n0.78%\n(1) See calculation method of key ratios on page 16 of this document\nManagement Comments\nTimothy J. Franz, BNC President and Chief Executive Officer, said, \"In 2017 our team demonstrated its entrepreneurial spirit and opportunism to create value for shareholders. We sold a branch to generate an $864 thousand gain and received settlement funds related to litigation pursued to benefit shareholders. We reduced our non-interest expenses by more than $2.0 million, or 5.0%, as we overhauled mortgage-banking operations and contained costs across all lines of business. We also improved banking operations as demonstrated by the 7.2% increase in net interest income. While charges linked to tax reform significantly impacted our fourth quarter results, lower income tax expense in future periods should bode well for corporate America, including BNC.\"\nMr. Franz continued, \"Our problem credits are low and our capital is strong and our people are dedicated to serving clients and their communities. As we begin 2018 it appears energy prices are firming up which is good for western North Dakota. In addition, the macro economy appears to be gaining momentum which is generally good for banking. Overall, we are well positioned to continue creating shareholder value in the new year.\"\nFourth Quarter 2017 Comparison to Fourth Quarter 2016\nNet interest income for the fourth quarter of 2017 was $7.036 million, an increase of $423 thousand, or 6.4%, from $6.613 million in the same period of 2016. Overall, the net interest margin increased to 3.06% in the fourth quarter of 2017 from 3.04% in the fourth quarter of 2016.\nInterest income increased by $592 thousand, or 8%, to $8.009 million, for the quarter ended December 31, 2017, compared to $7.417 million in the fourth quarter of 2016. This increase is the result of higher yields and average balances of taxable investments and loans held for investment, and funds held at the Federal Reserve resulting from successful deposit generation. The average balance of interest earning assets increased by $46.1 million. The average balance of loans held for investment increased by $17 million, resulting in $229 thousand more interest income. The average balance of investment securities increased by $43.2 million, resulting in $538 thousand more interest income. These increases were partially offset by the $31 million decrease in the average balances of mortgage loans held for sale resulting in a decrease in interest income of $219 thousand compared to the fourth quarter of 2016. The $17.7 million increase in the average balance of interest bearing cash balances yielded 1.18% and earned $56 thousand in the fourth quarter 2017. The yield on average interest earning assets increased to 3.46% in the fourth quarter of 2017 from 3.41% in the fourth quarter of 2016 as yields rose in all asset classes.\nInterest expense in the fourth quarter of 2017 was $973 thousand, an increase of $169 thousand from the same period in 2016 due to increased average deposit balances, partially offset by lower borrowings. Average interest bearing deposit balances increased $59.3 million while the average balance of FHLB short-term advances decreased $40.3 million. The cost of total interest bearing liabilities increased to 0.54% in the current quarter compared to 0.47% in the same period of 2016. The cost of core deposits in the fourth quarters of 2017 and 2016 was 0.33% and 0.26%, respectively. The higher cost of funds is a result of higher balances and rates of money market accounts and consumer certificates of deposits.\nProvision for credit losses was $100 thousand in the fourth quarter of 2017 and $0 in the fourth quarter of 2016.\nNon-interest income in the fourth quarter of 2017 was $4.415 million, a decrease of $457 thousand, or 9.4%, from $4.872 million in the fourth quarter of 2016. Mortgage banking revenues were $2.663 million in the fourth quarter of 2017, compared to $3.573 million in the fourth quarter of 2016. The sales of securities were timed to maximize income tax efficiency, incurred a loss of $495 in the fourth quarter of 2017, compared to $0 in the prior year fourth quarter. Other non-interest income increased $848 thousand largely as a result of gains on sales of deposits and fixed assets of a rural North Dakota branch.\nNon-interest expense decreased $450 thousand, or 4.5%, to $9.551 million in the fourth quarter of 2017, from $10.001 million in the fourth quarter of 2016. Salaries and employee benefits were $5.091 million, largely unchanged from the fourth quarter 2016. The number of full time equivalent employees (\"FTEs\") at December 31, 2017 was 252, down by 39 FTE's, or 13.4%, since December 31, 2016. Employee headcount decreased by 48, or 15.6%, since December 31, 2016. During the fourth quarter of 2017 headcount decreased by 5. Much of the headcount decrease related to mortgage support staff as the business is being right-sized to fit current revenues. Professional services in the fourth quarter of 2017 were down $322 thousand, or 28.7%, primarily due to reduced mortgage banking activities and legal expenses. Marketing costs decreased $87 thousand, or 9.2%, quarter to quarter largely attributed to a reduction in mortgage activity.\nIn the fourth quarter of 2017, income tax expense was $1.5 million, compared to $37 thousand in the fourth quarter of 2016. The effective tax rate was 81.7% in the fourth quarter of 2017, compared to 2.5% in the same period of 2016. The increase in the effective tax rate is primarily due to the Company recording a $1.208 million income tax expense to revalue its net deferred tax assets as a result of tax reform. Before considering the effect of the revaluation adjustment of $1.208 million, the effective tax rate would have been 14.6%. The effective tax rate is lower than the federal statutory rate primarily due to the proportion of the Company's pretax income earned from tax-exempt securities.\nNet income was $329 thousand, or $0.09 per diluted share, in the fourth quarter of 2017. Net income in the fourth quarter of 2016 was $1.447 million, or $0.41 per diluted share.\nYear Ended 2017 Comparison to Year Ended 2016\nNet interest income in 2017 was $27.865 million, an increase of $1.862 million, or 7.2%, from $26.003 million in the same period of 2016. Overall, the net interest margin increased to 3.05% in 2017 from 3.03% in 2016.\nInterest income increased by $2.097 million, or 7.1%, to $31.443 million, in 2017, compared to $29.346 million in 2016. This increase is the result of higher balances and yields on taxable investments, higher average balances of loans held for investment, and increased funds held at the Federal Reserve. The yield on average interest earning assets was 3.42% in 2017 and 2016. The average balance of interest earning assets increased by $55.8 million. The average balance of loans held for investment increased by $21.2 million, yielding $923 thousand of additional interest income, while the average balance of mortgage loans held for sale was $22.7 million lower than the same period of 2016 earning $640 thousand less interest income than in the prior period. The average balance of investment securities was $21.6 million higher in 2017 compared to 2016, yielding $1.5 million in additional interest income. The average balance of cash held at the Federal Reserve increased by $36.6 million when comparing the two periods, and yielded an additional $405 thousand of interest income in 2017.\nInterest expense in 2017 was $3.578 million, an increase of $235 thousand from the same period in 2016. The cost of interest bearing liabilities was 0.50% in 2017 compared to 0.49% in the same period of 2016. In 2016, the Company redeemed the remaining balances of outstanding brokered certificates of deposit; resulting in brokered certificate of deposit interest expense of $477 thousand during 2016 that did not recur in 2017. Interest expense increased in other categories of deposits, driven largely by increased volume and cost of consumer certificates of deposit and money market accounts. The cost of core deposits in 2017 and 2016 was 0.30% and 0.23%, respectively. Due to lower mortgage loan funding levels and increased deposit balances in 2017, the Company's FHLB short-term advances outstanding averaged $1.9 million compared to $36.9 million in 2016.\nProvision for credit losses was $350 thousand in 2017 and $800 thousand in 2016.\nNon-interest income in 2017 was $19.499 million, a decrease of $6.278 million, or 24.4%, from $25.777 million in 2016. Mortgage banking revenues were $11.301 million in 2017, compared to $19.465 million in 2016, a decrease of $8.164 million, or 41.9%. During 2016, we experienced higher loan volume, as interest rates were generally lower. Mortgage banking revenues have been lower in 2017 as rates moved higher, dampening demand and compressing margins. Gains on sales of loans increased by $502 thousand in 2017 while gains on sales of investment securities remained flat when compared to 2016. Gains on sale of assets can vary significantly from period to period. Other non-interest income benefited in 2017 from the settlement of a litigation matter in the third quarter as well as the sale of a rural North Dakota branch in the fourth quarter of 2017.\nNon-interest expense in 2017 decreased $2.077 million, or 5%, to $39.116 million, from $41.193 million in 2016. Salaries and employee benefits decreased $938 thousand, or 4.4%, in 2017 due to lower staffing levels as noted above. Professional services decreased compared to 2016 by $653 thousand, or 14.3%, primarily due to reduced mortgage banking volumes and reduced legal fees. Marketing and promotion expenses are down $351 thousand, or 9.2%, largely attributed to a reduction in mortgage activity. Other expense decreased $327 thousand largely due to mortgage cost reduction efforts.\nDuring 2017, income tax expense was $3.020 million, compared to $2.631 million in 2016. The effective tax rate was 38.2% in 2017, compared to 26.9% in the same period of 2016. The increase in the effective tax rate is primarily due to the Company recording $1.208 million of income tax expense to revalue its net deferred tax assets as a result of tax reform. Excluding the effect of the revaluation adjustment of $1.208 million, the effective tax rate would have been 22.9%. This effective rate is lower than the federal statutory rate primarily due to the proportion of the Company's pretax income earned from tax-exempt securities.\nNet income was $4.878 million, or $1.38 per diluted share in 2017. Net income in 2016 was $7.156 million, or $2.03 per diluted share.\nAssets, Liabilities and Equity\nTotal assets were $946.1 million at December 31, 2017, an increase of $35.8 million, or 3.9%, compared to $910.4 million at December 31, 2016. Loans held for investment aggregated $428.3 million at December 31, 2017, an increase of $13.7 million, or 3.3%, since December 31, 2016. Loans held for investment in North Dakota experienced notable prepayments as our borrowers with excess liquidity are deleveraging. Loans held for sale as of December 31, 2017 were down $3.0 million from December 31, 2016. Investment and cash balances increased $11.8 million and $14.7 million, respectively, from year-end 2016 as we deployed funds related to increased deposits.\nTotal deposits were $817.8 million at December 31, 2017, compared to $752.6 million at December 31, 2016. During 2017, core deposits, which include recurring customer repurchase agreement balances, have increased by $70.7 million to $835.8 million, or 9.2% from $765.1 million as of December 31, 2016 after giving effect to the December 2017 sale of a North Dakota bank branch. In 2017, deposits in our Arizona locations grew $23.9 million, or 17.5%, while growth in the non-Bakken North Dakota branches was $50.8 million, or 13.2%. The growth in deposits during 2017 has notably improved the results of operations and created value for shareholders. Core deposits decreased by $17.2 million to $835.9 million, compared to the $853.1 million core deposits as of September 30, 2017 as we sold $14.0 million of deposits as part of the sale of a North Dakota branch. In 2016, BNC generally utilized Federal Home Loan Bank short-term advances as flexible borrowings. In early 2017, such advances were paid down as deposits increased.\nThe table below shows total deposits since 2013:\nDecember 31,\nDecember 31,\nDecember 31,\nDecember 31,\nDecember 31,\n(In Thousands)\n2017\n2016\n2015\n2014\n2013\nND Bakken Branches\n$\n168,981\n$\n178,677\n$\n190,670\n$\n178,565\n$\n166,904\nND Non-Bakken Branches\n435,255\n384,476\n388,630\n433,129\n382,225\nTotal ND Branches\n604,236\n563,153\n579,300\n611,694\n549,129\nBrokered Deposits\n-\n-\n33,363\n53,955\n64,525\nOther\n213,570\n189,474\n167,786\n145,582\n109,575\nTotal Deposits\n$\n817,806\n$\n752,627\n$\n780,449\n$\n811,231\n$\n723,229\nTrust assets under management or administration increased 17.4%, or $47.6 million, to $321.3 million at December 31, 2017 as we have been able to convert commercial deposits to wealth management customers.\nCapital\nBanks and bank holding companies operate under separate regulatory capital requirements.\nAt December 31, 2017, our capital ratios exceeded all regulatory capital thresholds, including thresholds that incorporate fully phased-in conservation buffers.\nA summary of our capital ratios at December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016 is presented below:\nDecember 31,\n2017\nDecember 31,\n2016\nBNCCORP, INC (Consolidated)\nTier 1 leverage\n9.53%\n9.47%\nTotal risk based capital\n19.98%\n19.96%\nCommon equity tier 1 risk based capital\n14.15%\n13.90%\nTier 1 risk based capital\n16.90%\n16.78%\nTangible common equity\n8.18%\n8.13%\nBNC National Bank\nTier 1 leverage\n9.62%\n9.67%\nTotal risk based capital\n18.31%\n18.41%\nCommon equity tier 1 risk based capital\n17.06%\n17.16%\nTier 1 risk based capital\n17.06%\n17.16%\nThe Common Equity Tier 1 ratio, which is generally a comparison of a bank's core equity capital to its total risk weighted assets, is a measure of the current risk profile of our asset base from a regulatory perspective. The Tier 1 leverage ratio, which is based on average assets, does not consider the mix of risk-weighted assets. In recent periods, regulators have required Tier 1 leverage ratios that significantly exceed \"Well Capitalized\" ratio levels. As a result, management believes the Bank's Tier 1 leverage ratio is our most restrictive capital measurement and we are managing the Tier 1 leverage ratio to levels significantly above the \"Well Capitalized\" ratio threshold.\nIn addition to regulatory risk based capital standards, we believe that regulators and investors also monitor the capital ratio of tangible common equity to total period end assets.\nThe Company routinely evaluates the sufficiency of its capital in order to ensure compliance with regulatory capital standards and to provide a source of strength for the Bank. We manage capital by assessing the composition of capital and the amounts available for growth, risk or other purposes.\nBook value per common share of the Company was $22.40 as of December 31, 2017, compared to $21.47 at December 31, 2016. Book value per common share, excluding accumulated other comprehensive income, was $22.38 as of December 31, 2017, compared to $20.98 at December 31, 2016.\nAsset Quality\nThe allowance for credit losses was $7.9 million at December 31, 2017, compared to $8.3 million at December 31, 2016. The allowance for credit losses as a percentage of total loans at December 31, 2017 was 1.69%, compared to 1.82% at December 31, 2016. The allowance as a percentage of loans and leases held for investment at December 31, 2017 was 1.84%, and at December 31, 2016 was 2.00%.\nNonperforming assets were $2.0 million at December 31, 2017, down from $2.7 million at December 31, 2016. The ratio of nonperforming assets to total assets was 0.21% at December 31, 2017 and 0.29% at December 31, 2016. Nonperforming loans were $2.0 million at December 31, 2017, down from $2.4 million at December 31, 2016.\nAt December 31, 2017, BNC had $11 million of classified loans, $2.0 million of loans on non-accrual, no other real estate owned, and no repossessed assets. At December 31, 2016, BNC had $12.9 million of classified loans, $2.4 million of loans on non-accrual, $214 thousand of other real estate owned, and $4 thousand of repossessed assets. BNC had $1.7 million of potentially problematic loans, which are risk rated \"watch list\", at December 31, 2017, compared with $8.1 million as of December 31, 2016.\nFor most of 2017 economic activity in western North Dakota continued to be affected by challenging conditions in the agricultural and energy industries. In particular, the areas near Dickinson, Williston and Minot are believed to be more adversely affected by the economic conditions than other areas of North Dakota. While energy prices improved as 2017 ended, prolonged periods of lower agricultural and energy prices as well as more recent drought conditions in the region could have an adverse economic impact on the North Dakota economy, commodity dependent businesses, and our loan portfolio.\nBNCCORP, INC., headquartered in Bismarck, N.D., is a registered bank holding company dedicated to providing banking and wealth management services to businesses and consumers in its local markets. The Company operates community banking and wealth management businesses in North Dakota, Arizona and Minnesota from 15 locations.
