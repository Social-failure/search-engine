The plan submitted by the bondholders would give them a bigger stake, but the precise size was unclear. \nFredriksen would have a major stake in the restructured company under the both plans, the sources said. \nKris Hansen, a lawyer with Stroock & Stroock & Lavan, who represents the ad hoc bondholders, did not respond to a request for comment. \nFredriksen’s plan is backed by 97 percent of Seadrill’s bank lenders, who hold about $5.7 billion in secured loans. Their approval will be needed for plan amendments. \nFredriksen also has the support of holders of 40 percent of the unsecured bonds, short of the two-thirds of bondholders he will need to avoid a tough legal fight to get the plan approved. \nThe ad hoc bondholder group held nearly 30 percent of the company’s unsecured bonds in October, according to a filing with the U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Houston. \nFredriksen has been trying to acquire the company’s bonds, sources told Reuters, but one source close to the talks said the bondholders signed a “lock-up” agreement that prevented the selling of their holdings. \nIt is the second time the company has postponed a hearing on its disclosure statement, which describes the restructuring plan and must be approved by the court before creditors can vote on the plan of reorganization.
