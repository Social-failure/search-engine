The executives from companies including Nucor , U.S. Steel, ArcelorMittal and Commercial Metals said the sustained surge of steel imports into the United States had \"hollowed out\" much of the domestic steel industry and was threatening its ability to meet national security needs.\nCritics charge that using national security to erect steel tariffs could trigger a trade war with China , undermine the global rules-based trading system and hurt U.S. allies more than China and damage global growth prospects.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-12T03:13:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-12T03:37:38.004+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
