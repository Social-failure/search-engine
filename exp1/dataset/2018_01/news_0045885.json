France’s CAC 40 is up 4 percent and Germany’s DAX has gained 3.2 percent, helped higher by a more marked pick-up in business activity on the continent and receding political risks. \nMarket analysts said the UK’s underperformance and a slightly weaker pound had prompted some opportunistic “dip buying” on Friday. \n“You’ve actually had some downside momentum for the past few days,” said Chris Beauchamp at IG. “The number of stocks above their 20 and 50 day moving averages has been declining, but this usually signifies a buying opportunity, and that appears to be materialising this morning.” Reporting by Tom Pfeiffer; Additional reporting by Julien Ponthus; Editing by Hugh Lawson", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-26T19:20:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-26T21:17:51.009+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
