Those factors include whether information about Americans, such as Social Security numbers, would be exposed as part of the transaction or whether the deal would facilitate fraud.\nThe Act would also establish fees capped at 1 percent of the value of the transaction or $300,000, whichever is less, which would be deposited in a CFIUS fund.\nThe proposed legislation is backed by some companies, including Oracle Corp. The software maker supports the bill because it is focused on specific national security concerns and distinguishes between investments that are financially motivated and investments that are strategically motivated.\nConversely IBM opposes the bill, arguing that it would bog down an already busy panel with routine transactions.
