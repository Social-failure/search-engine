The UK's FTSE .FTSE also fell by 0.3 percent. \nBritish contractor Interserve ( IRV.L ) tumbled 10 percent after the Financial Times reported that government ministers are “very worried” and have set up a team of officials to monitor the company following the collapse of competitor Carillion. \nTech .SX8P was among the few sectors in positive territory, underpinned by a 3.6 percent surge in ASML ( ASML.AS ). \nThe Dutch chipmaking equipment supplier posted better-than-expected net profit in the fourth quarter as customers asked for early delivery of products as semiconductor demand booms. \nDespite Wednesday’s decline, the STOXX remains close to the 2 1/2 year high hit early this month on confidence over the region’s economic recovery and the upcoming earnings season. \n\"Conditions for a recovery of European equities are there but the over-extension of gains on the S&P 500 .SPX represent a risk in the short term,\" said Anthilia Capital fund manager Giuseppe Sersale.
