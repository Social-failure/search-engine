The \"Greyball\" software identified regulators who were trying to hail a ride in an attempt to collect evidence of local law-breaking. Those rides would be canceled or never arrive. It has also been reported that the Justice Department was investigating whether Uber illegally used software to track drivers of its rival Lyft.\nBloomberg reported that authorities in Montreal were seeking evidence in May 2015 that Uber had violated tax laws. Uber's use of Ripley meant they didn't get any information, but Uber cooperated with a second search warrant and agreed to collect provincial taxes for each ride, Bloomberg said.\nEnsign said the company shut down Ripley in 2016 because it didn't work well.\nShe said Uber now has a tool called ULocker that can remotely lock and encrypt devices. Ensign could not immediately say if Uber has used that to protect data from law enforcement as well. But she said Uber's guidance to employees bars use of the tool where it isn't legal.\nIn a statement, Uber said this security tool is similar to those used by other companies and gives them a way to block access to data when an employee loses a device. The company said its policy is to cooperate with \"all valid searches and requests for data.\"\nThe ride-hailing service had a scandal-ridden 2017 that included lawsuits, government probes, the revelation of a significant sexual-harassment problem and the disclosure of a cover-up of a hack that stole personal information of 57 million passengers and 600,000 drivers. The company's hard-charging CEO, Travis Kalanick, resigned in June and was replaced in August by the former CEO of Expedia, Dara Khosrowshahi.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-12T17:14:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-12T17:26:56.003+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
