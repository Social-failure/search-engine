Turkish Airlines confirmed in a subsequent statement that it had begun negotiations with Airbus on the plane deal.\nAirbus is also in negotiations to sell planes to China during a visit by Macron next week.\nReporting by Tim Hepher; Writing by Laurence Frost; Editing by Ingrid Melander\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-01-06T00:59:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-05T22:26:14.021+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
