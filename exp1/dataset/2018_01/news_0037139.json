It has proven its efficiency, when we were targeting balancing supply and demand rather than targeting a particular oil price,” said Dmitriev.\nOPEC has said it wanted global oil stocks to return to a five-year average and the group’s officials have said that target could be reached by the middle or end of 2018.\nBut even when the target is reached, OPEC has insisted it would exit from cuts gradually in order not to shock the market.\n“Future mechanisms of cooperation and concrete tools could differ,” said Dmitriev.\nHe said oil producers had generated an extra $600 billion in revenues thanks to oil cuts and higher prices over the past year, which allowed them to resume investments and guarantee no supply shortages in the future.\nFor Russia and Saudi Arabia the deal has also paved the way for dialogue on many other fronts despite the two countries effectively fighting a proxy war in Syria.\n“The deal has created elements of trust in investments and in political cooperation. It did help political dialogue. It showed Russia and Saudi Arabia can work together,” Dmitriev said.\n“Without the deal, a visit of the Saudi king to Russia wouldn’t have been possible and wouldn’t have been that successful,” said Dmitriev, referring to King Salman’s visit in October.\nDmitriev’s $10 billion fund has joint projects with Saudi Arabia, including a $1 billion technology fund. He expects the number of projects to grow.\nHe also said Russia should embark on reforms such as cutting the state’s presence in the economy after the presidential election in March, in which the current leader Vladimir Putin is widely anticipated to be re-elected.\n“In some sectors, the role of the state represents more than 70 percent. It is clearly too much,” said Dmitriev.\n“From the investment point of view, we see the need for reform such as the sale of non-core assets by state companies. This could boost Russia’s economic growth,” he said.\nReporting by Dmitry Zhdannikov; Editing by Mark Bendeich\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-23T13:01:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-23T13:25:23.011+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
