The app allows both parties to agree on a penalty if footage is shared.\nActs of revenge porn if the relationship broke down would be a breach of contract and easy to take to court, the developers say.\nThe idea of such an app was ridiculed by actress Catherine Deneuve and other French women in a recent open letter which said the #MeToo campaign had gone too far and Sweden’s plans “bordered on ridiculous”..\n“Next thing you know, two adults wanting to sleep together will have to specify beforehand, via an app ... which practices they do and don’t consent to,” they wrote, apparently unaware of LegalFling.\nOther commentators have raised concerns about the ethics and workability of the app.\nWriting on tech site Gizmodo, journalist Melanie Ehrenkranz said consent was not a “one-time checklist” but should occur continually throughout a sexual encounter and could also be withdrawn.\nThe LegalFling website states users can change their mind and withdraw consent through the app.\nEditing by Katy Migiro.
