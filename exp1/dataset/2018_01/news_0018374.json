The party was private but immediately followed a nearby DFJ one-day conference and was attended by some DFJ partners and staff, leading some to the impression that it was a DFJ-sanctioned event.\nThe event at Jurvetson's home in Half Moon Bay followed the firm's new annual Big Think conference. But personal friends of Jurvetson — unaffiliated with DFJ — were also invited to the party, which included security and around 100 to 150 people.\n\"We were dismayed to learn of behavior at the party that was completely at odds with DFJ's culture, which has been, and will continue to be, built on the values of respect and integrity. We would never want anyone to feel uncomfortable and we are sorry if that happened,\" the venture firm said in its statement.\nDFJ suggested the party played a role in Jurvetson's ouster from the firm late last year: \"The decisive action we've taken in recent months reflects our steadfast commitment to our values.\"\nA Jurvetson representative disputed the idea that his event was a \"sex party\" and said that the venture capitalist had hosted the event for at least three years — meaning that DFJ should not be in the dark about the event.\nMore from Recode:\nDid Google Assistant win CES 2018?

Obviously. That DFJ party was boring and corporate, with zero sex or nudity anywhere.\"\nJurvetson's camp also arranged calls between several attendees and reporters to push back on the idea that the event was full of sex and nudity, with multiple friends of Jurvetson telling Recode that it was not unlike other parties they attended elsewhere, featuring alcohol, music and costumes.\n\"Honestly, we laughed out loud,\" said Jenny Boyle, a designer, when she saw the description of the event as a \"sex party.\"\n— By Theodore Schleifer, Recode.net .\nCNBC's parent NBCUniversal is an investor in Recode's parent Vox, and the companies have a content-sharing arrangement.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-12T15:42:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-12T16:00:28.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
