REUTERS/Kim Kyung-Hoon Japan’s Toyota Motor Corp said last month it expected 2017 sales to grow 2 percent to 10.35 million units worldwide across its Toyota, Lexus, Daihatsu and Hino brands. It said it would hit 10.5 million vehicles in 2018.\nVW was No. 1 with 10.3 million vehicle sales in 2016, Toyota second with 10.2 million and Renault-Nissan third with 9.96 million.\nVW said December 2017 China sales jumped 17.8 percent to 460,100 vehicles, while monthly sales in Europe rose 3.1 percent, driven by Germany. U.S. sales were down 5.2 percent.\nOverall, carmakers saw European sales fall 4.8 percent in December from the same month a year ago due in part to one less working day, industry data showed on Wednesday.\nVW has set aside about 25 billion euros ($30 billion) to cover fines, lawsuits and vehicle repairs related to the diesel scandal.\nReporting by Ludwig Burger in Frankfurt and Gilles Gillaume in Paris; Editing by Edmund Blair, Douglas Busvine and Alexander Smith\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-17T20:21:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-17T20:40:17.025+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
