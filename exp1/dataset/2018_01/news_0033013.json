Elsewhere in the sector National Grid ( NG.L ) fell 1.5 percent, Severn Trent ( SVT.L ) retreated 0.1 percent and Centrica ( CNA.L ) 1 percent. \n“The sector is struggling a bit, mainly because there seems to be loads of competition,” said City of London Markets trader Markus Huber, pointing to comparison websites that help consumers to find the best deals. \n“Also, with wholesale energy prices on the way up at the moment, there might be concerns that they won’t be able to pass these on to customers fully, especially with the price cap legislation hanging over them.” \nPrimark owner AB Foods was the biggest FTSE faller, dropping 3.6 percent. \nThe company maintained full-year earnings guidance on Thursday but said that revenue and profit at its sugar business would fall by more than previously expected because of lower European Union sugar prices. \nAmong gainers, Hargreaves ( HRGV.L ) rose by 4.3 percent after a price target upgrade from Barclays. \nWhitbread ( WTB.L ) also rose, advancing 3.5 percent as prospects of a break-up of the company more than offset disappointment over a drop in sales for its Costa Coffee business in a tough British retail market. \nReuters reported late on Wednesday that investor Sachem Head was pushing the company to consider splitting the Costa Coffee chain from its hotels and restaurant businesses. \nAmong mid-caps, Balfour Beatty ( BALF.L ) rose 1.6 percent after the infrastructure group released financial details on the positive impact expected from tax cuts in the United States.
