It is risky. It is reckless. And it is wrong,” House Speaker Paul Ryan said in a statement, referring to Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer. \nSenator Patrick Leahy, the senior Democrat on the Senate Appropriations Committee, issued a statement accusing Republicans of angling for a shutdown. \n“President Trump wants to shut down the government over his cynical and misbegotten ‘big beautiful wall,’ which will be paid for by U.S. taxpayers, NOT Mexico,” Leahy said.

REUTERS/Yuri Gripas \nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said Democrats were aiming to “hold the entire country hostage” by demanding that a “non-imminent problem” related to immigration be resolved immediately. \nDemocrats want to put the Dreamers, a group of people brought into the U.S. illegally as children, onto a pathway to citizenship and protect them from deportation. \nTrump said in September he was ending former President Barack Obama’s Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) programme shielding around 700,000 Dreamers, who are mostly from Mexico and Central America. Trump set a March 5 deadline for Congress to write legislation to protect them. \nHowever, Democrats have argued that an average of 122 Dreamers a day have been losing their DACA protections since September, leaving them in limbo. \nSchumer, responding to McConnell, said: “We all know what the problem is. It’s complete disarray on the Republican side,” referring to conflicting immigration demands floated over the past several months by the Trump administration.

The president rejected a bipartisan Senate compromise last week after saying he would support one in theory. TEARY-EYED DREAMERS \nInstead of passing a month-long patch to government spending, Schumer proposed a “very short-term” bill to keep the government running, which he said could spark a deal over the next few days on immigration and overall spending levels through Sept. 30, the end of this fiscal year. \nDemocratic Senator Dick Durbin, who is leading the fight on behalf of Dreamers, met a teary-eyed group of the youngsters in his offices as the Senate wrapped up its work for the night. \nHe later told reporters that a high-level bipartisan meeting earlier on Thursday had showed signs of promise. \nDurbin said the negotiators “finally started talking about real issues, Dream Act citizenship and border security in more specific terms.” \nHouse passage came only after conservatives secured a promise from Ryan that he would soon advance some type of legislation to bolster U.S. military readiness, satisfying their desire for increased defence spending, said Republican Representative Mark Meadows, head of the House Freedom Caucus. \nThe 2018 fiscal year began on Oct. 1. Congress’ inability to agree on overall funding levels has meant that the government has been operating on a series of temporary measures that mainly kept spending at the previous year’s levels. \nBesides extending government funding for a month to give negotiators more time to work on a longer deal, the House’s temporary spending bill would extend the Children’s Health Insurance Program (CHIP) for low-income families for six years. \nRepublicans inserted the measure in a move partly to lure Democratic support.
