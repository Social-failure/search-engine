Payable on March 15, 2018, the dividend will be distributed to shareholders of record as of March 1, 2018.\nClaude Davis, Chief Executive Officer, commented, \"As we mentioned during our fourth quarter earnings call, the passage of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act in late December was a significant positive for First Financial and all of our stakeholders, and prompted evaluation of our dividend policy and capital allocation strategies. This increase in our dividend is consistent with our stated goal of consistently providing strong shareholder returns while supporting planned growth initiatives and maintaining target capital levels.\"\n\"In addition to the dividend increase, we will accelerate the timing of our dividend payment in an effort to align dividend practices in anticipation of our pending merger with MainSource Financial Group.\"\nFirst Financial Bancorp has paid a cash dividend every quarter since the holding company was formed in April of 1983.
