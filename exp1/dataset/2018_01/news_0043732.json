By checking the developer's name, user reviews and the number of app downloads, investors can measure the validity of an app and be more confident in their choice.\" \nHackers have used apps including phrases like \"bitcoin exchange,\" \"bitcoin wallet\" and \"cryptocurrency\" to lure potential victims, according to the report. \nCybersecurity has become an increasing concern for the cryptocurrency industry as interest in bitcoin and other digital coins has soared. \nLast month, cryptocurrency mining network Nice Hash admitted to being hacked in a cyber-breach that saw tens of millions of dollars' worth of digital tokens stolen. In the same month, Yapian, the owner of South Korea's Youbit exchange, filed for bankruptcy following a hack that saw 17 percent of its cryptocurrency holdings stolen. \nApple and Google were not immediately available for comment when contacted by CNBC.
