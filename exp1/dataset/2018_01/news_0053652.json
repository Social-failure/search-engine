Devin Nunes (R., Calif.), a close ally of Mr. Trump. The four-page document has been made available to all House members for more than a week, but many GOP lawmakers had been calling for it to be released to the public.\nThe matter now goes to Mr. Trump, who has five days to decide whether to object to the release of the material. If he does, the full House of Representatives can override his decision. If he doesn’t object, the material will be released.\nWhite House spokesman Hogan Gidley said Tuesday that Mr. Trump plans to meet with his national security team and White House counsel Don McGahn to review the memo. Mr. Gidley said he didn’t have a timetable on when the president might make a decision on whether to release the memo to the public.\n“The president would never put national security at risk, so that’s obviously one of the main points when he’s reviewing the document,” said Mr. Gidley.\nDemocrats were defeated Monday night on a motion to release their own memo that rebuts the GOP one. The Democratic document will be made available to the full House, and Republicans on the panel say they are open to releasing it to the public in the coming days.\nThe House Judiciary Committee’s top Democrat, Jerry Nadler (D., N.Y.), on Tuesday asked the Republican chairman to hold an executive session to allow committee members to review the materials on which the memo is purportedly based, but was voted down 16-12.\nMr. Ryan defended the decision to publicly release only the GOP memo, saying it had already gone through a process of being “scrubbed” to make sure no sensitive information on law-enforcement sources or methods is inadvertently revealed.\n“The chairman went to the FBI to go through the memo, to make sure that we were protecting any sources and methods and we are confident we are,” Mr. Ryan said. “None of that work has been done on this new memo.”\nFBI officials reviewed the Republican document over the weekend. Democrats said they expected their document also to be reviewed by law enforcement before any public release.\nThe Justice Department said in a letter last week that it would be “extraordinarily reckless” to release the Republican memo without giving Justice Department and the FBI an opportunity to review it. A Justice Department spokeswoman said Tuesday the department had reviewed the memo since last week’s letter and had no further comment.\nPeople familiar with the GOP memo say it raises concerns about surveillance under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, or FISA,—specifically how a campaign associate of Mr. Trump’s came to be the target of U.S. spying and whether a dossier of salacious and unverified material was used in part to obtain the warrant to conduct the surveillance.\nAccording to people who have seen the memo, it expresses concerns about how prosecutors used the dossier in their application for a FISA warrant to monitor Carter Page, a former foreign-policy adviser to Mr. Trump.\nMr. Page hasn’t been accused of wrongdoing. He has called the Russia probe, now led by special counsel Robert Mueller, a “baseless, politically motivated investigation” and said it has harmed him in terms of reputation, money and time.\nDemocrats say the GOP document is misleading, cherry-picked and part of a continuing GOP effort to discredit the investigation into whether Mr. Trump or his associates colluded with Russia in its interference in the 2016 presidential campaign and whether the president obstructed justice when he fired former FBI Director James Comey, who opened the Russia probe. Mr. Trump has denied there was collusion and that he obstructed justice. Moscow has denied it meddled in the campaign.\n“Chairman Nunes’ memo contains significant inaccuracies and omissions that misrepresent the underlying intelligence and jeopardize the effectiveness of our intelligence and law enforcement communities,” House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D., Calif.) said in a statement Monday night. “Americans should be deeply concerned by Speaker Ryan’s sanctioning of this irresponsible decision and his complicity in allowing the Committee investigation to devolve into a sad political spectacle.”\nMr. Ryan said Tuesday that the memo raises “legitimate questions about whether an American’s civil liberties were violated by the FISA process.” He added the memo was an appropriate part of Congress’ responsibility to oversee the executive branch.\nBut Mr. Ryan noted that any “malfeasance” at the FBI didn’t extend to the entire agency. Mr. Trump has broadly criticized the law-enforcement community as part of his fury against the Russia investigation, while also singling out top officials for criticism.\n“We want the people at the FBI to know we respect their job and we respect what they do,” Mr. Ryan said.\nThe House speaker also said he saw no reason for Mr. Trump to fire deputy attorney general Rod Rosenstein, the Justice Department official supervising the special counsel’s criminal investigation into Russian interference during the 2016 election. Mr. Trump last June wanted to fire Mr. Mueller , appointed by Mr. Rosenstein to lead the investigation, according to a person familiar with the matter, but backed off that decision.\nConcerns about Mr. Page’s ties to Russia weren’t just confined to the Obama administration. The memo also says that Mr. Rosenstein, an appointee of Mr. Trump, approved a renewal of surveillance of Mr. Page sometime in the spring of 2017, according to a person familiar with the matter.\n“I think Rod Rosenstein’s doing a fine job. I have no reason to see why he should do that,” Mr. Ryan said in response to a question about whether it would be a mistake for Mr. Trump to fire him. “Rod Rosenstein was hired after this last election. I think the people at the FBI, at the DOJ need to clean their own house if there are problems.”\n—Aruna Viswanatha and Peter Nicholas contributed to this article.\nWrite to Kristina Peterson at kristina.peterson@wsj.com and Byron Tau at byron.tau@wsj.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-30T22:29:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-31T01:25:59.028+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
