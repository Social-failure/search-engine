The nuclear industry is struggling with project delays and a slowdown in approvals for new domestic projects.\nBy creating a unified home-brand series of reactors, and combining firms, China will be better positioned to bid for and finance overseas projects, experts say.\nBoth companies have built nuclear plants overseas, including in Pakistan, and developing Chinese nuclear technology abroad is a key goal of China’s Belt and Road initiative.\n“(The) merger ... will give the new company vast financial firepower to take on the significant capital costs involved in developing new nuclear reactors – both domestically and abroad,” said Georgina Hayden, head of power and renewables at BMI Research.\nLast year, the government oversaw the marriage of China’s top coal miner Shenhua Group Corp Ltd with China Guodian Group Corp, among the country’s top five state power producers, to create the world’s largest power utility.\nThis deal will reduce the number of enterprises administered by the central government to 97, compared with 117 in 2012.\n“We expect this trend (of consolidation) to continue as Beijing continues to streamline its SOEs,” said Hayden.\nRelated Coverage Factbox: China regulator okays state-brokered nuclear deal SASAC’s clearance comes about 10 months after the companies’ listed entities flagged a deal involving their parent companies was in the works.\nIt is a re-marriage of sorts for the two companies after they were separated in 1999 under a previous round of SOE reform.\n($1 = 6.2936 Chinese yuan renminbi)\nReporting by Josephine Mason and Muyu Xu in BEIJING and David Stanway in SHANGHAI; Editing by Kenneth Maxwell\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-31T10:07:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-31T10:41:03.011+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
