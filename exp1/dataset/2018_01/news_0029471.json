The election is Egypt’s third since the 2011 uprising that deposed President Hosni Mubarak.\n“I call on civilian and military institutions to maintain neutrality towards everyone who had announced their intention to run and not take unconstitutional sides of a president who will leave his post in a few months,” Anan said.\nFILE PHOTO: General Sami Anan (L), Army chief of Staff and member of the SCAF at the Supreme Council of the Armed Forces, and other high-ranking military officials attend the Coptic Christmas eve mass at the main cathedral in Cairo, Egypt January 6, 2012. REUTERS/Amr Abdallah Dalsh/File Photo Anan said in his statement that he had formed his civilian presidential team, which includes Hisham Genena, a former policeman and judge who was appointed to head Egypt’s corruption watchdog in 2012 and was sacked by Sisi in 2016.\nThe vote will be held on March 26-28, with a run-off vote on April 24-26 if no candidate wins more than 50 percent in the first round. Candidates will register from Jan. 20 to Jan. 29.\nThose challenging Sisi describe a sweeping effort to kill off their campaigns before they have begun, with media attacks on candidates, intimidation of supporters and a nomination process stacked in favor of the former general.\n“There are people I know who are corrupt, I will not allow them to come near this chair,” Sisi said earlier in announcing his candidacy.\nReporting by Amina Ismail and Ali Abdelaty; Editing by James Dalgleish and Leslie Adler\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-01-20T07:44:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-20T02:50:02.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
