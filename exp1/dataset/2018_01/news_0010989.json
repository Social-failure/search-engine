The woman appears disoriented and does not speak, waving her hands and screaming when asked if she needs help. \nThe bystander called an ambulance, which picked up the woman. \n“We share the shock and disappointment of many who have viewed the video showing the discharge of a patient from the Emergency Department,” the hospital said in a statement on Wednesday. “We are taking this matter very seriously, conducting a thorough review, and are evaluating the appropriate response, including the possibility of personnel action.” \nThe hospital did not identify the woman, give her condition or say why she had been released. \nThe National Weather Service said the overnight temperature in Baltimore on Tuesday fell to the 20s Fahrenheit (minus 1 to minus 6 Celsius).
