Additionally, the Bank Appointed Several New Private Client Banking Professionals to Existing Teams\nNEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Signature Bank (Nasdaq: SBNY), a New York-based full-service commercial bank, today announced results for its fourth quarter and year ended December 31, 2017.\nNet income for the 2017 fourth quarter was $114.9 million, or $2.11 diluted earnings per share, compared with $113.9 million, or $2.11 diluted earnings per share, for the 2016 fourth quarter. The increase in net income for the 2017 fourth quarter, when compared with the same period last year, is primarily the result of an increase in net interest income, fueled by strong average deposit and loan growth as well as an increase in prepayment penalty income. These factors were partially offset by an increase in the provision for loan losses attributable to taxi medallion loan write-downs and increased non-interest expenses.\nNet interest income for the 2017 fourth quarter rose $23.0 million, or 7.7 percent, to $319.8 million, compared with the fourth quarter of 2016. This increase is primarily due to growth in average interest-earning assets. Total assets reached $43.12 billion at December 31, 2017, expanding $4.07 billion, or 10.4 percent, from $39.05 billion at December 31, 2016. Average assets for the 2017 fourth quarter reached $42.15 billion, an increase of $3.97 billion, or 10.4 percent, versus the comparable period a year ago.\nDeposits for the 2017 fourth quarter declined $238.0 million, or 0.7 percent, to $33.44 billion at December 31, 2017, while non-interest bearing deposits increased $688.5 million and represent 34.0 percent of total deposits. Overall deposit growth in 2017 was 5.0 percent, or $1.58 billion, when compared with deposits at the end of 2016. Average total deposits for 2017 were $33.16 billion, growing $3.41 billion, or 11.5 percent, versus average total deposits of $29.75 billion for 2016.\n“2017 was a year during which our highly successful, single point of contact business model further distinguished Signature Bank in an exceedingly competitive marketplace. We continued to attract quality business relationships as evidenced by the growth in both our core deposits and loans. Notwithstanding our challenges in the taxi medallion business, we were able to achieve a double-digit return on equity,” explained Joseph J. DePaolo, President and Chief Executive Officer.\n“Now with tax legislation becoming law and the positive effect we believe it will have on future earnings and capital, we look forward to the $50 billion SIFI threshold potentially moving higher, to at least $100 billion. This will allow the Bank to slow down the pace of expense growth. Realistically, Signature Bank, with its uncomplicated and straight-forward balance sheet, should not be subject to the same standards as a truly complex, systemically important trillion-dollar financial institution. We welcome 2018 as we plan to strengthen our foundation by making major investments in our loan operation and origination systems, payments architecture platform and new foreign exchange system. We also will look to expand our geographic presence in areas where we have significant client synergies, such as the West Coast, after we successfully tested the waters in 2017 with the appointment of a team and the opening of our new accommodation office in San Francisco,” he concluded.\nSignature Bank Chairman of the Board Scott A. Shay, noted: “We are proud of the Bank’s performance for 2017. We are pleased with the progress we’ve made in building our businesses for the future. We believe in dealing with issues head on, as we did in 2017 with respect to our taxi medallion portfolio. We also are enhancing our franchise for the future by making technology investments that prepare and position the Bank for the rapidly evolving financial services arena. While adapting to changes of the world, we keep our dual missions front and center, namely ensuring the best client service and sleep at night depositor safety. Many in our industry prioritize by following the latest social media fads, but we are convinced our two pillars of service and depositor safety will continue to grow the value of our franchise over time.”\n“We are also increasingly hopeful that Congress will pass legislation recognizing banks such as ours should not be put at a disadvantage to the mega banks by being saddled with regulatory burdens disproportionate to our size and complexity,” Shay concluded.\nCapital\nThe Bank’s Tier 1 leverage, common equity Tier 1 risk-based", "external_links": ["http://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.newyorklawjournal.com%2Fhome%2Fid%3D1202798758328%2FNYLJ-Best-Of-2017%3Fmcode%3D1202615325582%26curindex%3D1&esheet=51744900&newsitemid=20180118005248&lan=en-US&anchor=annual+Best+of+reader+survey&index=5&md5=f8cd9bbf1debd8c376148539439f5d83", "http://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=https%3A%2F%2Finternationalbanker.com%2Fbanking%2Finternational-banker-2017-north-south-american-awards-winners%2F&esheet=51744900&newsitemid=20180118005248&lan=en-US&anchor=International+Banker+2017+North+and+South+American+Awards&index=8&md5=9a6f11e0dfead9b66926a1c8401d9d03", "http://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=https%3A%2F%2Furldefense.proofpoint.com%2Fv2%2Furl%3Fu%3Dhttp-3A__www.newyorklawjournal.com_-3Fslreturn-3D20140727160908%26d%3DDQMFaQ%26c%3DIJeB4aO1m0W7F5rtImPnvg%26r%3DLibBDz5uS38VNPYVdjHF6Udm7B7VNwVXFsKs3ivMqIA%26m%3DtTDQFlYcVlM_t4Qvz6k3EROwHzcwhBwTZnUVoVVjMQI%26s%3Df8i1sMDmDYBVIQ8gq3bF0kfni4js6zQhEc0eJ98y49o%26e%3D&esheet=51744900&newsitemid=20180118005248&lan=en-US&anchor=New+York+Law+Journal&index=4&md5=b5df73e950563cbe20ec85683cf1ae20", "http://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.signatureny.com%2F&esheet=51744900&newsitemid=20180118005248&lan=en-US&anchor=Signature+Bank&index=1&md5=22f8136208b526b84e5c303168047cdc", "http://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=http%3A%2F%2Fpdfserver.amlaw.com%2Fnlj%2FBest_NLJ%2Findex.html&esheet=51744900&newsitemid=20180118005248&lan=en-US&anchor=2017+Best+of%C2%A0The+National+Law+Journal&index=7&md5=f8a227d9af88f0678bc24bc6699bddf4", "http://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.forbes.com%2Fsites%2Fkurtbadenhausen%2F2017%2F01%2F10%2Famericas-best-banks-2017%2F%2347e789857434&esheet=51744900&newsitemid=20180118005248&lan=en-US&anchor=Forbes%27%C2%A0Best+Banks+in+America&index=3&md5=146ae5ad5605dc41a3e835c91eb6e555", "http://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.signatureny.com&esheet=51744900&newsitemid=20180118005248&lan=en-US&anchor=www.signatureny.com&index=10&md5=2e69728e75c6e1e27741064016af9082", "http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180118005248/en/", "http://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=https%3A%2F%2Furldefense.proofpoint.com%2Fv2%2Furl%3Fu%3Dhttp-3A__www.stevieawards.com_ABA%26d%3DDwMFaQ%26c%3DIJeB4aO1m0W7F5rtImPnvg%26r%3Dz6z2rgawPNzCw0b0LRwzXg20O5AMNZjSC09Nfutr210%26m%3DVQjQ3jdJxapahPip2BDRvjRrYh9BzkfJqNcvo83yQBI%26s%3DaliJHHu5wIhkOKtIFdSnHpEYyDPUV-4zBMJ91C9hVLQ%26e%3D&esheet=51744900&newsitemid=20180118005248&lan=en-US&anchor=The+15th%C2%A0Annual+American+Business+Awards&index=9&md5=2fbec04f6dc361acd9f36ef8c28e86a7", "http://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.signatureny.com&esheet=51744900&newsitemid=20180118005248&lan=en-US&anchor=www.signatureny.com&index=2&md5=0d3341685a46a892974ff65cc63d9749", "http://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=http%3A%2F%2Fpdfserver.amlaw.com%2Fnlj%2FBest_NLJ%2Findex.html%23p%3D8&esheet=51744900&newsitemid=20180118005248&lan=en-US&anchor=the+nation%27s+best+private+banking+services+providers&index=6&md5=3d9fa289a137976d3872935af0b23544"], "published": "2018-01-18T13:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-18T13:23:17.006+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
