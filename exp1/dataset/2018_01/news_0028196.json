But of course giving effect to those commitments will be extremely challenging,” said Rory Montgomery, Second Secretary General at the Department of Foreign Affairs, in a speech in Dublin.\n“One of the key questions ... is to what extent will it be possible for it to enshrine, if you like, the commitments and protections agreed before Christmas. And of course how will this sit with the other set of commitments made by the British government to the DUP and Northern Ireland,” he said.\n“That will be a major challenge.”\nReporting by Conor Humphries; Editing by Catherine Evans\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-01-18T04:42:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-18T01:05:33.026+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
