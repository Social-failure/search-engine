The FPO are not just populists - they are an enemy of democracy,” said Benjamin Abtan, president of the European Grassroots Anti-Racist Movement, who spoke at the event.\n“People don’t understand that the FPO is not a regular party, they are extremely radical. They should not have a seat at the top tables in Europe.”\nAbtan cited comments from Interior Minister Herbert Kickl of the FPO, who last week said asylum seekers should be “concentrated” in special centres to help the authorities process their applications swiftly.\nThe wording evoked Nazi-era concentration camps and triggered a storm of protest in Austria.\nSenior FPO figure Norbert Hofer on Saturday told Austrian radio that Kickl’s comments were not maliciously or consciously meant, and that human rights would be respected in dealing with asylum seekers.\nReporting by John Revill in Zurich and Francois Murphy in Vienna; editing by Clelia Oziel\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-13T19:08:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-13T19:18:34.010+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
