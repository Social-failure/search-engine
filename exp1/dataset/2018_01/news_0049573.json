Some vessel speed restrictions, however, remain in north Germany, it said.\nRising water levels mean vessels do not have enough space to sail under bridges.\nThe Rhine is an important shipping route for commodities including minerals, coal and oil products such as heating oil, grains and animal feed. It is also an important route for Switzerland’s imports\nReporting by Michael Hogan; Editing by Biju Dwarakanath\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-29T09:17:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-29T09:42:06.005+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
