However, this has prompted a backlash in popular destinations such as Barcelona, Palma de Majorca or San Sebastian as locals complain of a drop in long-term rentals and rising prices.\nThe tourism surge has raised business activity in the sector, including increased merger and acquisition interest between hotel groups and expected passenger records at Spanish airports.\nOn Wednesday, NH Hotels declined a takeover offer by rival Barcelo, an operation which would have created the country’s largest hotel chain, though it said it would still analyse future strategic possibilities.
