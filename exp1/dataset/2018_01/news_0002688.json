In 1990, companies announced plans to cut 316,047 jobs. \nLast month saw 7.4 percent fewer job-cut announcements than November, and 3.6 percent fewer than in December 2016. \nWidespread restructuring and competition from online sales led to unprecedented cuts in retail jobs in 2017. Retail employers announced 76,084 job cuts this year, a 28 percent increase from 2016, according to the Challenger report. \n\"The retail pivot that caused thousands of store closures and job cuts was not seen in any other industry this year,\" John Challenger said. \nThe health-care and services sectors also had significantly higher job-cut announcements in 2017. Health-care employers announced 40,732 cuts, a 118 percent increase over 2016, while announced plans to cut jobs in services almost quadrupled to 36,174. \n\"While companies in the Pharmaceutical, Health Care, Construction, and Food industries did announce more job cuts than last year, it was nothing like the Energy cuts seen in the last two years or the Financial cuts seen during the recession,\" Challenger said. \nDespite the losses, the passage of the tax bill has prompted unprecedented hiring plans for 2018. Employers report plans to hire more than 1.1 million near hires, 27 percent more than last year.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-04T14:31:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-04T14:35:02.016+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
