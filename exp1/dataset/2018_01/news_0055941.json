Mexico’s state oil firm Pemex has done some drilling in the country’s shale reserves, but produced little. \nMexico’s National Hydrocarbons Commission is waiting for authorization from the energy ministry to hold the auction, said CNH head Juan Carlos Zepeda. \n“We are waiting for the ministry of energy to establish the specific schedule,” he said. The tentative schedule “would be to award the blocks before the end of this year.” \nThe Burgos basin in northeastern Mexico would be one of the areas on offer, Zepeda said. Burgos is part of a large geological formation rich in oil and gas reserves that includes the massive U.S. Eagle Ford shale region. \nThat region has been heavily drilled and produces around 1.6 million barrels per day (bpd) of a total of 6.5 million bpd in output from the seven largest U.S. shale regions, U.S. government data shows. \nThe other area up for grabs in Mexico is the Tampico-Misantla basin in the Gulf Coast states of Veracruz and Tamaulipas, Zepeda said. \nIdle drilling equipment could easily be moved from Eagle Ford south of the border to work on Mexico’s shale fields, once the auction takes place, Zepeda said. \nMexico liberalized its energy sector in 2014, and has since held nine auctions for oil and gas fields both onshore and offshore. None of those auctions included shale fields. \nA presidential election in July may slow the pace of auctions. The leading candidate for the election, leftist Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, has said he would review the contracts awarded since the reform.
