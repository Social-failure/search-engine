This compares to GAAP net income of $5.7 million, or $0.17 per diluted share, and adjusted net income of $5.3 million, or $0.16 per diluted share, for the fourth quarter of 2016. GAAP results for the fourth quarter of 2017 include (i) a charge of $8.1 million, or $0.25 per diluted share, for the write-off of fixed assets and other costs associated with the consolidation of ITG’s New York office space and (ii) tax benefits of $1.7 million, or $0.06 per diluted share, primarily relating to the realization of fully reserved U.S. deferred tax assets following a tax method change, along with the impact of a lower U.S. corporate tax rate on an existing U.S. deferred tax liability due to the recently enacted Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017. GAAP results for the fourth quarter of 2016 include (i) a charge of $3.6 million pre-tax, or $0.09 per diluted share after taxes, related to the SEC ADR settlement, (ii) a restructuring charge of $5.3 million pre-tax, or $0.10 per diluted share after taxes, related to management delayering and the elimination of certain positions and (iii) a pre-tax charge of $0.6 million, or $0.02 per diluted share after taxes, for the amount expensed for upfront awards granted to ITG’s CEO. These charges were offset by an after-tax gain of $7.3 million, or $0.22 per diluted share, related to a reduction in tax reserves from resolving a multi-year contingency in the U.S.\nRevenues of $126.7 million, compared to revenues of $119.6 million in the fourth quarter of 2016. GAAP expenses of $127.2 million and adjusted expenses of $119.0 million compared to GAAP expenses of $121.7 million and adjusted expenses of $112.3 million in the fourth quarter of 2016. Adjusted expenses for the fourth quarter of 2017 and the fourth quarter of 2016 exclude the charges listed above.

ITG’s international operations are gaining momentum, as demonstrated by record results in Asia Pacific and strong performance in Europe and Canada. With the advent of MiFID II, we are well positioned to deliver even more value to clients globally as they work to achieve best execution and improve operating efficiency.”\nFourth Quarter Regional Segment Results\nNorth American revenues were $67.2 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 as compared to $72.2 million in the fourth quarter of 2016.\nITG reported a net loss of $2.6 million in North America in the fourth quarter of 2017 compared to North American net income of $0.5 million in the fourth quarter of 2016.\nU.S. revenues in the fourth quarter of 2017 were $51.4 million, compared to $56.0 million in the fourth quarter of 2016.

Please visit www.itg.com for more information.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nTo supplement our financial information presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. (“GAAP”), management uses certain “non-GAAP financial measures” as such term is defined in Regulation G promulgated by the SEC. Generally, a non-GAAP financial measure is a numerical measure of a company’s operating performance, financial position or cash flows that excludes or includes amounts that are included in, or excluded from, the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP. Management believes the presentation of these measures provides investors with greater transparency and supplemental data relating to our financial condition and results of operations, and therefore a more complete understanding of factors affecting our business than GAAP measures alone. In addition, management believes the presentation of these matters is useful to investors for period-to-period comparison of results as the items may reflect certain unique and/or non-operating items such as acquisitions, divestitures, restructuring charges, write-offs and impairments, charges associated with litigation or regulatory matters together with related expenses or items outside of management’s control.\nAdjusted revenues, adjusted expenses, adjusted pre-tax income, adjusted income tax expense ( benefit) , adjusted net income and adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA), together with related per share amounts, are non-GAAP performance measures that we believe are useful to assist investors in gaining an understanding of the trends and operating results for our core business. These measures should be viewed in addition to, and not in lieu of, results reported under GAAP.\nReconciliations of adjusted revenues, adjusted expenses, adjusted pre-tax income, adjusted income tax expense ( benefit) , adjusted net income and adjusted EBITDA to revenues, expenses, (loss) income before income tax expense (benefit), income tax expense (benefit), net (loss) income and related per share amounts as determined in accordance with GAAP for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, are provided in the accompanying supplemental tables at the end of this release.\nForward Looking Statements\nIn addition to historical information, this press release may contain \"forward-looking\" statements that reflect management’s expectations for the future. In some cases, you can identify these statements by forward-looking words such as “may,” “might,” “will,” “could,” “should,” “would,” “expect,” “plan,” “anticipate,” “believe,” “estimate,” “predict,” “trend,” “potential” or “continue” and the negative of these terms and other comparable terminology. A variety of important factors could cause results to differ materially from such statements.\nCertain of these factors are noted throughout ITG’s 2016 Annual Report on Form 10-K, and its Form 10-Qs (as amended, if applicable) and include, but are not limited to, general economic, business, credit, political and financial market conditions, both internationally and domestically, financial market volatility, fluctuations in market trading volumes, effects of inflation, adverse changes or volatility in interest rates, fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, evolving industry regulations and increased regulatory scrutiny, the outcome of contingencies such as legal proceedings or governmental or regulatory investigations and customer or shareholder reaction to, or further proceedings or sanctions based on, such matters, the volatility of our stock price, changes in tax policy or accounting rules, the ability of the Company to realize the benefits of its deferred tax assets subject to a valuation allowance, the actions of both current and potential new competitors, changes in commission pricing, rapid changes in technology, errors or malfunctions in our systems or technology, operational risks related to misconduct or errors by our employees or entities with which we do business, cash flows into or redemptions from equity mutual funds, ability to meet the capital and liquidity requirements of our securities business and the related clearing of our customers’ trades, customer trading patterns, the success of our products and service offerings, our ability to continue to innovate and meet the demands of our customers for new or enhanced products, our ability to protect our intellectual property, our ability to execute on strategic initiatives or transactions, our ability to attract and retain talented employees, and our ability to pay dividends or repurchase our common stock in the future.\nThe included herein represent ITG’s views as of the date of this release.
