REUTERS/Luke MacGregor/File Photo \nAsda, owned by Walmart ( WMT.N ), increased sales by 2.2 percent in the period to Dec. 31, while 2.1 percent more came through the tills at Morrisons ( MRW.L ) and Sainsbury’s ( SBRY.L ) was up 2.0 percent, the research group said. \nBut growth at Aldi [ALDEI.UL] and Lidl continued to outpace the four, with both discounters seeing sales rise by 16.8 percent. \n“Overall supermarket sales increased in value by 3.8 percent, with an additional 1 billion pounds ringing through the tills compared to the same festive period last year,” said Fraser McKevitt, Kantar Worldpanel’s head of retail and consumer insight. \n“Shoppers parted with 747 million pounds on Dec. 22 alone, making the Friday before Christmas the busiest shopping day ever recorded.” \nMorrisons beat forecasts on Tuesday for underlying Christmas sales, as premium products, online sales and competitive prices lured more shoppers into the fourth biggest supermarket group. \nMorrisons was the first of the big four to report on Christmas trade. Sainsbury‘s, the No. 2, reports on Wednesday and Tesco updates on Thursday. \nRival market researcher Nielsen also named Tesco the best Christmas performer among the major grocers on Tuesday, although Asda outpaced it in the shorter December period. \nGrocery inflation stood at 3.7 percent for the period, Kantar said.
