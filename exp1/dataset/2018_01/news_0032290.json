Brent crude futures were steady at $69.4 per barrel, hovering far above levels of around $40 per barrel that both the Russian government and the central bank had predicted several months ago.\nThe rouble also saw support from oil prices, trading 0.04 percent stronger 56.74 against the dollar and inching closer to its strongest level of 56.20 since early June.\nAgainst the euro, the rouble gained 0.1 percent to 69.28 .\nThe rouble’s upside, however, is limited by the finance ministry that buys dollars on the market to replenish reserves it spent on plugging holes in the budget.\nFor rouble poll data see reuters://realtime/verb=Open/url=cpurl://apps.cp./Apps/fx-polls?RIC=RUB=\nFor Russian equities guide see\nFor Russian treasury bonds see\nRussia in graphics: link.reuters.com/dun63s (Reporting by Andrey Ostroukh Editing by Jeremy Gaunt)\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-18T10:23:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-18T10:37:58.010+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
