( bit.ly/2qGymPl ) \n“It is critical that we continue to work with the industry, to excel at customer satisfaction, to act with uncompromising integrity, and to achieve the highest standards of excellences,” the Oregonian quoted Intel Chief Executive Brian Krzanich as saying in the memo. \nIntel declined to comment on the report. \nThe largest chipmaker confirmed earlier this week that the security issues reported by researchers in the company’s widely used microprocessors could allow hackers to steal sensitive information from computers, phones and other devices. \nKrzanich also appointed Intel Vice President Steve Smith to the newly formed group and reassigned several top executives to the new organization, the newspaper reported. The changes would be immediately effective.
