It was not immediately clear which side the man was on.\nTuesday, Dalit protesters threw stones at buses in various parts of Mumbai, while rail services on a main line across the city were disrupted, said a senior police official who declined to be identified as he is not authorized to speak to the media.\n“Traffic has been disrupted in the eastern part of the city after protesters blocked a few roads,” the official said.\nRiot police walk past a damaged public bus during a protest in Mumbai, India January 2, 2018.
