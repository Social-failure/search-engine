Munich Re said it expected more frequent extreme events in the future. \n“We have a new normal,” said Ernst Rauch, head of Munich Re’s Corporate Climate Centre, which monitors climate change risks. \n“2017 was not an outlier,” he said, noting that insured losses surpassed $100 billion multiple times since 2005. “We must have on our radar the trend of new magnitudes.” (Reporting by Tom Sims and Alexander Huebner; Editing by Maria Sheahan)", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-04T12:34:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-04T13:07:45.010+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
