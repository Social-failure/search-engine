The Street had expected earnings per share of 56 cents. Revenue on $13.7 billion was in line with expectations.\nPfizer's innovative health unit grew 5 percent on an operational basis from a year earlier, reaching $8.2 billion in revenue driven by Eliquis, Xeljanz and Prevenar. Its essential health business decreased 8 percent operationally year over year, falling to $5.4 billion.\nShares of Pfizer fell 1.6 percent in premarket trading after initially gaining. Meanwhile, Amazon , Berkshire Hathaway and JPMorgan Chase announced they would partner on U.S. employee health care.\nHere's how Pfizer did compared with what Wall Street expected:\nEPS: 62 cents vs. the Thomson Reuters estimate of 56 cents. Revenue: $13.7 billion vs. $13.7 billion expected by Thomson Reuters' survey of analysts. In the fourth quarter, the company reported a net profit of $12.3 billion, or $2.02 per share. However, after stripping out special items, the company earned $3.8 billion, or 62 cents per share, in the latest period, outpacing analyst estimates of 56 cents per share.\nFor the full year, Pfizer forecasts revenue ranging $53.5 billion to $55.5 billion and adjusted earnings per share ranging $2.90 to $3, above the Street's estimates of $53.9 billion and $2.78 per share, respectively. The guidance includes $5 billion in buybacks.\nPfizer said its effective tax rate on adjusted income will be about 17 percent next year, down from 20 percent this year. It anticipates a $15 billion tax bill over eight years to repatriate its overseas cash.\nIn wake of the new tax law, the company plans to invest approximately $5 billion in capital projects in the U.S., including building its manufacturing presence. It plans to contribute $500 million to its U.S. pension plan and has allocated about $100 million for a special, one-time bonus for all nonexecutive employees in the first quarter of 2018.\nPfizer also contributed $200 million to the Pfizer Foundation.\nBids are due Thursday for its consumer health unit. The company expects the business, which includes brands like Advil and ChapStick, to generate about $20 billion. Johnson & Johnson dropped out of the competition , leaving GlaxoSmithKline and Reckitt Benckiser among those preparing bids.\n\"We remain on track to make this decision, which could include everything from a full or partial separation to ultimately deciding to retain the business, during 2018,\" CEO Ian Read said in a statement.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-30T13:53:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-30T14:35:01.019+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
