A single transaction took about 1 1/2 hours to be processed and included a fee of 123,000 rupiah so this had discouraged its wider use for payments, said Karana. \nThe official declined to name the businesses because he was still waiting for further instructions from Bank Indonesia in Jakarta. \n“The next step is we will ban them as mandated by the law. We ask them not to use it anymore. Along with the Directorate of Special Crime Investigation unit, we will enforce the rule that all transactions in Indonesia must use rupiah.” \nSome locals in Bali said bitcoin was being used mainly by foreigners on the island, which is Indonesia’s tourism hub and has a large expatriate community. \nBank Indonesia has called ownership of virtual currencies high risk and prone to speculation, because no authority takes responsibility or officially administers them and because there is no underlying asset to be the basis for the price. \nVirtual currencies could also be used in money laundering and terrorism funding, and could have an impact on the stability of the financial system and causes losses for society, it has said. \nWhile trading has not be regulated so far, the central bank has said it was looking into the issue. \nRegulators around the world have been grappling with how to address risks posed by cryptocurrencies, as bitcoin, the world’s most popular virtual currency, soared more than 1,700 percent last year. \nPrices have plummeted since South Korea said last week it may ban domestic cryptocurrency exchanges. \nBitcoin.co.id, an Indonesian online cryptocurrency exchange, said on its website that bitcoin was trading at 162.70 million rupiah ($12,247) per unit after losing around a quarter of it value this week. \n($1 = 13,285.0000 rupiah)", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-01-19T16:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-19T12:05:33.002+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
