Since taking the helm two years ago, Rial made clear his main goal was to raise bank’s profitability and market share. \nAnalysts said the CEO strategy is working. \n“Santander Brasil has successfully turned around its business and now boasts one of the highest levels of profitability in our coverage,” said Deutsche Bank’s analyst Tito Labarta. \nThe CEO added that although the bank remains committed to growing return on equity, there may be ups and downs as interest rates hit their all-time low in the country and banks increase competition in loans. This may affect margins in the near term, he said. \nShares of Santander Brasil were up 1.8 percent, at 36.37 reais and show a 19-percent gain so far this year. \nRial and Chief Financial Officer Angel Santodomingo said Santander Brasil is being cautious in risk management to avoid rising default rates as the credit expansion picks up pace. \nSantander Brasil had a 3.2 percent delinquency rate in the fourth quarter, 0.3 percentage point above the previous quarter. \n($1 = 3.1633 reais)", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-31T18:22:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-31T18:40:09.003+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
