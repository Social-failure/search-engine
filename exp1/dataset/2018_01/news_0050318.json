(NYSE: DST) reported consolidated net income attributable to DST of $81.2 million ($1.34 per diluted share) for the fourth quarter 2017 compared to $42.9 million ($0.66 per diluted share) for the fourth quarter 2016. Net income attributable to DST for the year ended December 31, 2017 was $451.5 million ($7.27 per diluted share) compared to $427.3 million ($6.41 per diluted share) for the year ended December 31, 2016.\nIncome from continuing operations attributable to DST Systems, Inc. (\"DST Earnings\"), which excludes discontinued operations, was $81.2 million ($1.34 per diluted share) for the fourth quarter 2017 compared to $54.6 million ($0.84 per diluted share) for the fourth quarter 2016. DST Earnings for the year ended December 31, 2017 was $447.0 million ($7.20 per diluted share) compared to $179.0 million ($2.68 per diluted share) for the year ended December 31, 2016.\nTaking into account certain non-GAAP adjustments, DST Earnings were $67.5 million ($1.11 per diluted share) for the fourth quarter 2017 compared to $53.9 million ($0.83 per diluted share) for the fourth quarter 2016, and $207.8 million ($3.36 per diluted share) for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to $190.9 million ($2.87 per diluted share) for the year ended December 31, 2016.\n\"Our fourth quarter and full year 2017 financial results demonstrate our continued success in delivering value to our clients and achieving efficiencies within our businesses,\" said Steve Hooley, Chairman, CEO and President of DST. \"We are pleased to be moving ahead with our recently announced agreement to combine with SS&C Technologies Holdings, Inc. (\"SS&C\") for $84 per share in cash, through which we expect to deliver significant value for our shareholders while enhancing the value that we can bring to our clients for the long-term.\"\nConsolidated Financial Highlights\nOperating Results\nFourth quarter 2017 diluted earnings per share from continuing operations, after non-GAAP adjustments, was $1.11, an increase of $0.28 or 33.7% from fourth quarter 2016. Significant items impacting the quarterly results include the following:\nConsolidated operating revenues increased $179.0 million or 47.9% to $552.7 million as compared to fourth quarter 2016, primarily as a result of the 2017 acquisitions of the remaining interests in Boston Financial Data Services (\"BFDS\") and International Financial Data Services U.K. (\"IFDS U.K.\") which contributed $179.7 million of incremental operating revenues during fourth quarter 2017. Consolidated operating income on a GAAP basis increased $1.9 million to $77.3 million as compared to fourth quarter 2016. Consolidated operating income, after non-GAAP adjustments, increased $22.3 million or 26.8% to $105.5 million as compared to fourth quarter 2016. The increase in operating income was primarily due to the operating income from the acquisitions of the remaining interests in BFDS and IFDS U.K. in 2017, partially offset by higher performance-based stock compensation expense. The effective tax rate for fourth quarter 2017 on a GAAP basis, which includes the estimated impact of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the \"Tax Act\") enacted in December 2017, was 18.1%. The effective tax rate for fourth quarter 2017, after non-GAAP adjustments, was 35.7%, a slight increase as compared to 35.3% in the fourth quarter 2016. The current quarter rate of 35.7% is lower than our previously expected rate for the quarter of 37.0% primarily due to the mix of international and domestic income and an increase in the amount of estimated tax credits. Weighted average diluted shares outstanding for fourth quarter 2017 were 60.6 million, a decrease of 4.4 million shares or 6.8% from fourth quarter 2016, primarily as a result of share repurchases during 2017.\nMerger Announcement\nAs announced on January 11, 2018, we have entered into a merger agreement wherein SS&C will acquire DST. Under the terms of the agreement, SS&C will purchase DST in an all-cash transaction for $84.00 per share plus the assumption of debt, equating to an enterprise value of approximately $5.4 billion. The transaction is subject to DST stockholder approval, clearances by the relevant regulatory authorities and other customary closing conditions and is currently expected to close by the third quarter of this year.\nNew and Amended Debt Agreements\nOn November 14, 2017, we entered into a Master Note Purchase Agreement (the \"Note Purchase Agreement\") for the private placement of $415.0 million aggregate principal indebtedness comprised of six tranches of notes with maturity dates ranging from 2023 through 2033 at an average fixed interest rate of 4.0%. Of the total placement of $415.0 million, $350.0 million was issued on November 14, 2017 and was primarily used to pay down our revolving credit facility. The remaining $65.0 million is scheduled to be issued on August 6, 2018 and we anticipate the proceeds will be used to repay the $65.0 million of debt that matures in August 2018.\nWe also renewed and modified our accounts receivable securitization program to extend the maturity date to November 14, 2020 and to include the BFDS receivables in the securitization program.\nReal Estate Transaction\nIn December 2017, we received a distribution of real estate and related debt from our 50/50 joint venture, Broadway Square Partners. The properties received in the distribution are utilized by our employees in downtown Kansas City, Missouri. Concurrently, Broadway Square Partners also distributed real estate, which was not occupied by DST, and cash to the other joint venture partner resulting in a continued 50/50 ownership in the partnership post-distribution. The step-up to fair value of the real estate and debt distributed resulted in a gain of $46.0 million recorded by the joint venture, of which $23.0 million is reflected in our equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates and has been excluded from our non-GAAP earnings. The land, buildings and parking facilities received were recorded on our Balance Sheet at $19.2 million. We recorded the debt assumed at its $4.4 million fair value on the date of distribution. On an annual basis, we expect this transaction will reduce our rent expense included within Costs and expenses by $2.4 million, partially offset by an increase to Depreciation expense of $0.3 million.\nTax Reform Impacts\nThe Tax Act implements a broad range of tax reform including changes to corporate tax rates, business deductions and international tax provisions. The impact of the Tax Act to the reported results for the fourth quarter 2017 is a $13.7 million tax benefit primarily from the net impact of the revaluation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities utilizing the enacted tax rate at the time they are anticipated to be realized less the estimated United States (\"U.S.\") toll charge associated with undistributed accumulated foreign earnings. This reflects our current estimate of the U.S. income tax effects of the Tax Act, however these are provisional amounts subject to adjustment during the one year measurement period. We have removed the current quarter impact of the Tax Act from our non-GAAP earnings as it represents a one-time financial impact. Taking into account the estimated impacts of the Tax Act, we currently expect the 2018 effective tax rate to be approximately 26.5%. The impact of the Tax Act may differ from these estimates, possibly materially, due to, among other things, changes in interpretations and assumptions we have made, federal tax regulations and guidance that may be issued by the U.S. Department of the Treasury and actions we may take as a result of the Tax Act.\nShare Repurchase Activity\nDuring the fourth quarter 2017, we spent $75.0 million to repurchase approximately 1.3 million shares of DST common stock resulting in $150.0 million remaining under the share repurchase plan that was approved in second quarter 2017. As a result of the merger agreement entered into in January 2018 with SS&C, we are precluded from declaring any further dividends and repurchasing any additional DST common stock under the existing share repurchase plan.\nDetailed Review of Financial Results\nThe following discussion of financial results takes into account the non-GAAP adjustments described in the section entitled \"Use of Non-GAAP Financial Information\" and detailed in the attached schedule entitled \"Reconciliation of Reported Results to Non-GAAP Results.\" On a GAAP basis, operating income for the fourth quarter 2017 for each segment was as follows: $38.0 million for the Domestic Financial Services segment, $19.3 million for the International Financial Services segment and $20.0 million for the Healthcare Services segment.\nSegment Results\nDomestic Financial Services Segment\nOperating revenues for the Domestic Financial Services segment for fourth quarter 2017 increased $67.7 million or 27.3% to $315.9 million as compared to fourth quarter 2016. The operating revenue increase was primarily driven by operating revenues from BFDS, which contributed approximately $61.4 million of incremental revenues during the fourth quarter 2017. BFDS revenues for the fourth quarter 2017 include $4.0 million of one-time revenue resulting from an early termination payment received from a client that migrated off our system during the quarter. Excluding the BFDS operating revenues in 2017, operating revenues for the Domestic Financial Services segment increased $6.3 million or 2.5%. The additional increase in operating revenues was primarily due to a $5.0 million increase in revenue at ALPS resulting from an insurance claim reimbursement of $2.0 million received in fourth quarter 2017 as compared to a reduction to ALPS revenue of $3.0 million in fourth quarter 2016 for the processing error that generated the insurance claim. In addition, operating revenues were higher as a result of increased fund flows and higher market performance at ALPS, partially offset by lower mutual fund registered shareowner account processing revenues. Also, software license revenues of $4.0 million in fourth quarter 2017 were $1.7 million lower as compared to fourth quarter 2016.\nDomestic Financial Services segment operating income increased $2.2 million or 4.0% during fourth quarter 2017 to $56.6 million as compared to fourth quarter 2016. The increase in operating income was primarily from the acquisition of the remaining interests in BFDS during 2017, including the $4.0 million termination fee received, partially offset by higher non-cash stock compensation expense as a result of an increase in the number of performance stock units we expect will vest coupled with lower software license revenue. Operating expense also increased as a result of additional spending to support our information technology transformation initiative, as well as higher run-rate costs for security and other infrastructure requirements. Operating margin for fourth quarter 2017 was 17.9% as compared to 21.9% in 2016.\nWe are pleased to announce that in December 2017 we entered into a ten year contract with a new client to provide both mutual fund and retirement servicing solutions. Based on current volumes, the client is expected to convert approximately 2.0 million registered accounts and 0.3 million retirement accounts onto our platforms during mid to late 2019. This new client currently performs their processing in-house and in order to assist the new client with covering the costs to transition to our platforms we have agreed to pay them $13.0 million in transition assistance during the conversion, of which $2.0 million was paid in December 2017. The total amounts to be paid will be amortized as a reduction to revenue over the course of the ten year contractual term. Additionally, in December 2017 we renewed our largest Domestic Financial Services client to a new 7 year contract. Based upon our new rate structure, we expect our operating revenue in 2018 associated with this client to be relatively consistent with the 2017 revenue.\nAs part of our continuing strategic review of our operations we decided not to renew a long-term surety bond insurance agreement which expired in December 2017 as the proposed revised terms were no longer economically advantageous. This agreement historically generated approximately $14.0 million of annual revenue.\nInternational Financial Services Segment\nOperating revenues for the International Financial Services segment for fourth quarter 2017 increased $116.6 million to $145.1 million as compared to fourth quarter 2016. The operating revenue increase was primarily driven by the acquisition of the remaining interests in IFDS U.K., which contributed $118.3 million of incremental operating revenues during the fourth quarter 2017. The IFDS U.K. fourth quarter 2017 revenue increased sequentially as compared to third quarter 2017 primarily as a result of agreements reached with various clients to fund system developments for certain regulatory changes. Software license revenues of $4.7 million in fourth quarter 2017 were $2.0 million higher as compared to fourth quarter 2016. The increases in IFDS U.K. revenues and software license revenues were partially offset by lower revenues as a result of the previously announced contract termination of a wealth management client.\nInternational Financial Services segment operating income increased $20.0 million during fourth quarter 2017 to $23.7 million as compared to fourth quarter 2016. The increase in operating income was primarily due to the acquisition of the remaining interest in IFDS U.K. and increased software license revenues, partially offset by operating costs associated with on-going development and implementation efforts for our wealth management platform clients. Operating margin for fourth quarter 2017 was 16.3% as compared to 13.0% in 2016.\nOur International Financial Services segment has been notified that two of our clients, which have collectively contributed approximately $33.0 million of annual revenues, will be migrating off our FAST platform in stages through the end of 2018.\nHealthcare Services Segment\nHealthcare Services segment operating revenues decreased $6.6 million or 5.9% during fourth quarter 2017 to $105.3 million as compared to fourth quarter 2016. The decrease was primarily attributable to the previously announced client migrations, which resulted in approximately $13.9 million lower revenues during the fourth quarter 2017. Excluding the customer migrations, Healthcare Services segment operating revenues increased $7.3 million or 7.4%. This increase in operating revenues was primarily the result of organic growth and the expansion of high-value services we are offering to clients in both the medical and pharmacy businesses, as well as a $0.3 million increase in software license revenue to $2.8 million in fourth quarter 2017. Operating revenues were adversely impacted by lower consulting and professional services revenues in the medical business driven by continued uncertainty of healthcare regulations as compared to the prior year.\nHealthcare Services segment operating income increased $0.1 million or 0.4% during fourth quarter 2017 to $25.2 million as compared to fourth quarter 2016. The increase was primarily due to organic growth and the expansion of the high-value services we are offering to existing clients in both the medical and pharmacy businesses, partially offset by client migrations during 2017. Operating margin for fourth quarter 2017 was 23.9% as compared to 22.4% in the fourth quarter 2016.\nDuring the fourth quarter 2017, we renewed our pharmacy services contract with the Healthcare Services segment's second largest customer extending the term of the contract through December 31, 2020.\nOther Financial Results\nEquity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates\nThe following table summarizes the Company's equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates (in millions):\nThree Months Ended\nYear Ended\nDecember 31,\nDecember 31,\n2017\n2016\n2017\n2016\nIFDS L.P.\n$\n2.5\n$\n(1.7)\n$\n8.1\n$\n2.2\nIFDS U.K.\n—\n1.8\n1.0\n10.0\nBFDS\n—\n2.8\n3.2\n8.3\nOther\n1.7\n0.4\n8.6\n6.7\n$\n4.2\n$\n3.3\n$\n20.9\n$\n27.2\nDST's equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates decreased as it discontinued recording equity in earnings of IFDS U.K. and BFDS on March 27, 2017 and March 30, 2017, respectively, as a result of the previously discussed acquisitions.\nUse of Non-GAAP Financial Information\nIn addition to reporting financial information on a GAAP basis, DST has disclosed non-GAAP financial information which has been reconciled to the corresponding GAAP measures in the following financial schedules entitled \"Reconciliation of Reported Results to Non-GAAP Results.\" In making these adjustments to determine the non-GAAP results, the Company takes into account the impact of items that are not necessarily ongoing in nature, that do not have a high level of predictability associated with them or that are non-operational in nature. Generally, these items include net gains on dispositions of businesses, net gains (losses) associated with securities and other investments, acquired intangible asset amortization, restructuring and impairment costs and other similar items. Our non-GAAP DST Earnings and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share are also adjusted for the income tax impact of the above items, as applicable. The income tax impact of each non-GAAP item is calculated by applying the statutory rate and local tax regulations in the jurisdiction in which the item was incurred. Additionally, income tax is adjusted to remove the impacts of large discrete or unusual items. Management believes the exclusion of these items provides a useful basis for evaluating underlying business unit performance, but should not be considered in isolation and is not in accordance with, or a substitute for, evaluating business unit performance utilizing GAAP financial information. Management uses non-GAAP measures in its budgeting and forecasting processes and to further analyze its financial trends and \"operational run-rate,\" as well as making financial comparisons to prior periods presented on a similar basis. The Company believes that providing such adjusted results allows investors and other users of DST's financial statements to better understand DST's comparative operating performance for the periods presented.\nDST's management uses each of these non-GAAP financial measures in its own evaluation of the Company's performance, particularly when comparing performance to past periods. DST's non-GAAP measures may differ from similar measures by other companies, even if similar terms are used to identify such measures. Although DST's management believes non-GAAP measures are useful in evaluating the performance of its business, DST acknowledges that items excluded from such measures may have a material impact on the Company's financial information calculated in accordance with GAAP. Therefore, management typically uses non-GAAP measures in conjunction with GAAP results. These factors should be considered when evaluating DST's results.\nImportant Additional Information and Where to Find It\nIn connection with the proposed merger, the Company intends to file relevant materials with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the \"SEC\"), including a preliminary proxy statement on Schedule 14A.
