He did not elaborate. \nAbout 48,000 asylum seekers from Syria arrived in Germany in 2017, according to data published on Tuesday, adding to almost half a million Syrian refugees who arrived in the previous two years. \nThe total number of asylum seekers registered in Germany in 2017 stood at 186,000, down 33 percent from 2016.
