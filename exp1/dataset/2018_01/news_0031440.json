(NYSE: NOV) today announced it combined its Rig Systems and Rig Aftermarket reporting segments into a single segment called Rig Technologies during the fourth quarter of 2017. The restructuring better aligns operations with the current and anticipated market environments, reduces administrative burden, and eliminates reported intercompany transactions between Rig Technologies’ capital equipment and aftermarket operations. The Company will report fourth quarter and full-year results in the new format on February 5, 2018.\nThe table below conforms prior period Rig Systems and Rig Aftermarket segment results to the new Rig Technologies segment presentation:\nSELECT RIG TECHNOLOGIES HISTORICAL FINANCIAL INFORMATION (Unaudited)\n(In millions) Three Months Ended Years Ended December 31, March 31, June 30, September 30, 2014 2015 2016 2017 2017 2017 Revenue: Rig Systems $ 9,848 $ 6,964 $ 2,386 $ 393 $ 346 $ 330 Rig Aftermarket 3,222 2,515 1,416 321 341 311 Intercompany Eliminations (1,272 ) (1,200 ) (692 ) (132 ) (141 ) (131 ) Rig Technologies $ 11,798 $ 8,279 $ 3,110 $ 582 $ 546 $ 510 Operating profit (loss): Rig Systems $ 2,118 $ 1,322 $ (969 ) $ 9 $ (7 ) $ 11 Rig Aftermarket 935 652 229 61 76 64 Intercompany Eliminations (522 ) (473 ) (293 ) (57 ) (63 ) (57 ) Rig Technologies $ 2,531 $ 1,501 $ (1,033 ) $ 13 $ 6 $ 18 Adjusted EBITDA: Rig Systems $ 2,220 $ 1,518 $ 293 $ 33 $ 26 $ 28 Rig Aftermarket 968 687 316 71 83 69 Intercompany Eliminations (522 ) (473 ) (293 ) (57 ) (63 ) (57 ) Rig Technologies $ 2,666 $ 1,732 $ 316 $ 47 $ 46 $ 40 Reconciliation of Operating profit (loss) to Adjusted EBITDA (Operating profit excluding other items before depreciation & amortization):\nOperating profit (loss) $ 2,531 $ 1,501 $ (1,033 ) $ 13 $ 6 $ 18 Other Items 23 124 1,255 12 17 - Depreciation and Amortization 112 107 94 22 23 22 Adjusted EBITDA $ 2,666 $ 1,732 $ 316 $ 47 $ 46 $ 40 The Company anticipates it will recognize between $120 and $140 million in pre-tax restructuring charges, including facility closures, severance and inventory write-downs, and other charges (collectively “other items”) during the fourth quarter of 2017.\nExcluding the impact of other items, the Company expects consolidated results for the fourth quarter of 2017 to be at or above prior expectations. The Company anticipates Rig Technologies will exceed prior guidance, Wellbore Technologies will be in-line with expectations, and Completion and Production Solutions will fall short of guidance. The shortfall in Completion and Production Solutions is due primarily to engineering challenges and delivery delays associated with a new product introduction in its Subsea Flexible Pipe business and softer than anticipated orders in its Process and Flow Technologies business.\nFourth Quarter and Full-Year 2017 Earnings Conference Call\nNOV will hold its fourth quarter and full-year 2017 conference call on Tuesday, February 6 at 10 a.m. (Central Time).
