It gave no further details.\nSources last week said Wanda Hotel’s parent company Dalian Wanda Group was expected to announce the sale of two Australian property projects, which The Australian newspaper said were worth about A$1 billion ($800 million).\nThe sales are expected to lessen financial strains on Dalian Wanda following a major acquisition spree by helping it meet upcoming debt deadlines.\nChina’s regulators last year told banks to stop providing funding for several of Wanda’s overseas acquisitions, sources have said, part of a crackdown on what Beijing sees as irrational spending by some domestic conglomerates.\nSince then, Wanda, whose businesses range from real estate to football and cinemas, has embarked on a string of asset sales.
