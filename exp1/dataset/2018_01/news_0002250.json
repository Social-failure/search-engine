It said that at about 2:40 p.m., a Secret Service employee reported that a fire was burning in the ceiling of the second floor.\nThere were no injuries, said Sergeant Arthur Mendoza of the New Castle Police Department. The cause of the fire was not immediately clear.\n“Fire extinguishers were utilized to suppress the fire and members of the Chappaqua Fire Department responded and inspected the area above the fire to ensure it had been completely extinguished,” the agency said in the statement.\nThe Clintons purchased the five-bedroom, 5,232-square-foot (486-square-metre) home for $1.7 million in 1999, the Journal News reported. Chappaqua is about 40 miles (64 km) north of New York City.\nReporting by Chris Kenning in Chicago; Editing by Jonathan Oatis and Peter Cooney\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-03T23:44:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-04T00:13:32.002+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
