Caterpillar expects adjusted earnings per share between $8.25 and $9.25, ahead of FactSet analysts' forecasts of $8.15 per share.\n\"We are in the early stages of implementing our strategy for profitable growth,\" CEO Jim Umpleby said.\nThe machinery manufacturer was the second-best performing stock on the Dow Jones industrial average in 2017.\nThe company could also stand to benefit from the Republican tax overhaul signed into law in December. Analysts at J.P. Morgan Chase upgraded Caterpillar shares in January, crediting the Republican tax bill for their positive outlook on the company.\nHowever, Caterpillar's current method of handling its taxes — namely, by using a Swiss subsidiary to slash its corporate rate — could be compromised in a $2 billion fight with the IRS.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-25T13:52:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-25T14:11:00.002+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
