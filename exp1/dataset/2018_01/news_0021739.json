Other law enforcement joined the manhunt. \nMore than two hours later, three sheriff’s deputies were shot as they confronted McCall, 47, who was also shot and wounded and taken into custody. \nFaris declined to name the officers or describe the extent of their injuries. McCall was being treated for gunshot wounds, Faris said.
