The global economy is in a synchronized upswing and world trade is growing at the fastest rate since the start of the decade.\nStocks of crude and products have fallen significantly since the middle of 2017. Oil demand is growing rapidly while OPEC and its allies have extended their production pact until at least the middle of the year.\nHistory suggests OPEC is more likely to tighten the oil market too much and allow prices to overshoot on the upside than rather than relax production cuts too early and risk prices falling back.\nSuch was the case after both the previous oil market slumps in 1997/98 and 2008/09, with prices overshooting the producer group’s initial targets.\nOPEC’s tightening bias probably explains why many hedge funds remain bullish despite benchmark Brent prices moving towards $70 a barrel.\nThe main downside risk comes from a resurgence of U.S. shale oil production, with WTI prices now above $60 a barrel.\nIf shale output starts to climb faster than expected OPEC could be forced to halt production cuts earlier than currently envisaged.\nThe existence of so many hedge fund long positions could eventually magnify the downside risk posed by U.S. shale.\nHowever, most hedge fund managers seem to have concluded that the risk is some way off and prices have more scope to climb before the inevitable correction.\nRelated column:\n“Brent prices caught in the calm before the storm?” Reuters, Dec. 20\nEditing by David Goodman\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-02T15:20:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-02T15:28:21.007+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
