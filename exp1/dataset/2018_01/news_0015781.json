REUTERS/ Kyle Grillot The sheriff’s office listed the names of the missing, who range in age from two to 62, in a statement on Friday night. \nThe disaster struck on Tuesday after heavy rains soaked the area near Montecito, where vegetation had been denuded by the largest wildfire in California’s history. \nSodden hillsides gave way, unleashing a torrent of mud, water, uprooted trees and boulders onto the valley below and causing what the police described as “traumatic injuries” to the victims, who ranged in age from 3 to 89. \n\nSlideshow (4 Images) The destruction covered 30 square miles, the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection said. \nOfficials ordered residents in most of the southeastern corner of Montecito, which is east of Santa Barbara, to leave their homes for what was likely to be one or two weeks. \nOne of California’s most celebrated roads, coastal Highway 101, was partially closed, with mud that was two feet deep in places, while in Montecito, mud reached the roof lines of houses, as residents surveyed their damaged homes. \n“We have a yard to redo and hopefully our insurance will help out with that, but the people across from me, newer homes, gone,” Garrett Speirs, a 54-year-old artist who has been living in Montecito for 20 years, said. \n“Everybody down below gone, two girls gone ... Two sixth-graders in the school our kids went to,” Speirs added. \nAdditional reporting by Alex Dobuzinskis in Montecito, California, Keith Coffman in Denver, Chris Kenning in Chicago, Gina Cherelus and Peter Szekely in New York and Jon Herskovitz in Austin, Texas; Writing by Scott Malone and Jon Herskovitz; editing by Alexander Smith and Diane Craft\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-13T13:14:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-13T13:27:30.010+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
