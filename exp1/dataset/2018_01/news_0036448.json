It said savings to consumers could exceed 100 million pounds. \nNational Grid said Ofgem’s proposed ranges for cost of debt and cost of equity did not reflect the cost of financing the project or the risk of construction. \nIt said Ofgem overestimated the potential savings to consumers from its approach. \nShares in the firm were down 1.9 percent in early trading, making it one of the top losers in FTSE 100 index. \nNational Grid said it would work on details of the project with Ofgem in the coming weeks, but would also consider other options if it could not reach agreement. It did not specify what those options were. \nOfgem said a final decision on whether to take what it called the “competition proxy” approach in spring 2018. $1 = 0.7166 pounds Reporting by Arathy S Nair in Bengaluru; Editing by Edmund Blair", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-23T11:46:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-23T12:22:29.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
