A majority of hedge funds think it has more room to go on the downside,” a trader said.\nWhile one or two lenders sold out of their positions at the end of last year, a number of original lenders are holding onto the paper, hoping the situation will improve, the sources said.\n“Since the call with lenders there has been no bid. People want clarity on what the sponsor and company will do to turn things around. At the moment it is all looking pretty desperate,” a second trader said.\nConsumer spending has come under pressure as people cut back on discretionary spending amid wider macroeconomic volatility. The restaurant sector has also faced increasing pressure on rising food costs after the UK voted to leave the European Union, the sources said.
