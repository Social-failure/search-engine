I just feel like Peter played an amazing 25 minutes of tennis, then the set was gone.”\nZverev has matched his best result in Melbourne, having also made the third round last year where he was beaten by Rafa Nadal in a five-set classic.\nHaving collected five titles in a brilliant 2017 season, he is seen among the best-placed of the young brigade to upset the grand slam cartel of Roger Federer and Rafa Nadal, despite having never passed the fourth round of the majors.\nBreaking through for a maiden quarter-final would be well earned in Melbourne, with six-times champion Novak Djokovic looming as a possible fourth round challenge.\nEditing by Catherine Evans\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-01-18T18:54:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-19T12:16:52.041+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
