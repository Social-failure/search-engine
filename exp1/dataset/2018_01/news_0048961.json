I have every expectation that they will continue to try and do that.”\n“But I am confident that America will be able to have a free and fair election. That we’ll push back in a way that is sufficiently robust that the impact they have on our election won’t be great.”\nPompeo also said China was trying to steal U.S. information.\nReporting by Guy Faulconbridge, editing by Michael Holden\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-01-30T15:47:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-30T16:40:13.006+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
