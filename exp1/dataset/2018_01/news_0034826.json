Its aim, over the six years it has been held, is to promote social integration through sport, organizers said.\nThe countries represented included Nigeria, Somalia, Djibouti, Eritrea, Ethiopia and Sudan. Some of the people taking part had come to Europe as asylum seekers while others were born on the continent.\nSlideshow (5 Images) “We are all human, we have differences, but the more (we have in) common, the more we share, the more common hobbies we find, the less important the differences might be,” organizer Erwin Himmelbauer told Reuters.\nThe race, held on a course 2km long which took most of the 45 competitors less than five minutes to complete, is more focused on fun than athletic skill - something the participants seemed to appreciate.\n“This is fantastic,” said Omad Suleiman, originally from Darfur, who traveled to the event from Norway where he has been living since 2014.\n“I think it is important for us and for European people when we can live together.”\nReporting by Heinz-Peter Bader and Mark Hanrahan,; Writing by Mark Hanrahan in London, editing by Ed Osmond\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-22T16:02:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-22T16:19:29.003+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
