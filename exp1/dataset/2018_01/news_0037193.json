The blue chip FTSE 100 .FTSE was down 0.2 percent at 7,715.44 points at its close. \nWilliam Hill and Ladbrokes, which is being bought by GVC ( GVC.L ) for up to 4 billion pounds, both hit their lowest level in more than seven weeks, while Paddy Power ( PPB.L ) on the FTSE fell 2.1 percent. GVC fell 1.2 percent. \nThe Sunday Times newspaper, citing an ally of new culture secretary Matt Hancock, reported that the betting cut was being taken to help tackle the issue of problem gambling. \nIn spite of the heavy losses, Investec analysts affirmed their buy rating on William Hill, saying a consultation over FOBTs (fixed odds betting terminals) only closes on Tuesday and that speculation over the final outcome was premature. \nAmong other outstanding movers were shares in Ocado ( OCDO.L ), up 27.5 percent, after the online grocer signed a deal with Sobeys Inc to develop the online grocery business at Canada’s second largest food retailer. \nOn the FTSE, NMC Health ( NMC.L ) rose 2.4 percent to a new record high after it announced the acquisition of majority stakes in a cosmetic surgery company and a clinics business for a combined $207 million. \nIn the same sector Shire ( SHP.L ) also rose, up 1.4 percent. \nConsumer staples took the most points off the FTSE 100, nearly nine points, with overseas earners Diageo ( DGE.L ), British American Tobacco ( BATS.L ) and Unilever ( ULVR.L ) falling as sterling rose towards $1.40. \nRelx ( REL.L ), down 2.6 percent, was among the biggest blue chip fallers, following a downgrade to “equal-weight” from “overweight” from Morgan Stanley.
