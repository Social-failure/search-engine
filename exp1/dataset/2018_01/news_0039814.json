(the “Company”) (Nasdaq:PBIP), the holding company for Prudential Bank (the “Bank”), reported net income of $34,000, or $0.004 per diluted share, for the quarter ended December 31, 2017 as compared to $731,000 or $0.10 per diluted share, for the comparable period in 2016. The decrease in net income for the three-month period ended December 31, 2017 as compared to the same quarter in the prior year reflected primarily the effect of the one-time non-cash charge related to the re-measurement of the Company’s deferred tax assets arising from the lower U.S. corporate tax rate provided for by the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (“Tax Reform Act”) enacted in December 2017.\nDennis Pollack, President and CEO, commented, “We are pleased to report continued positive results from the perspective of core earnings. Although we recognized a one-time tax charge during the quarter which was prevalent in the industry, the future lower income tax rates will be beneficial to Prudential on a going forward basis effective immediately. Furthermore, notwithstanding the charge, our capital position remains strong and in full compliance with all regulatory requirements. Management continues to be dedicated to executing our strategy, improving the Company’s profitability and enhancing shareholder value.”\nHighlights for the quarter ended December 31, 2017 are as follows :\nCore net income (a non-GAAP measure) increased $1.1 million or 145% to $1.8 million from the same period in 2016. Net loans increased $8.7 million, or 1.5%, from $571.3 million at September 30, 2017. Total deposits increased $16.0 million or 2.5%, from $636.0 million at September 30, 2017. The net interest margin increased to 2.80% for the first quarter of fiscal 2018 as compared to 2.70% for the same period in fiscal 2017. The efficiency ratio for the quarter ended December 31, 2017 decreased to 61.71% compared to 67.90% for the same period in 2016.\nNet Interest Income:\nFor the three months ended December 31, 2017, net interest income increased to $6.1 million as compared to $3.6 million for the same period in 2016. The increase reflected a $3.5 million increase in interest income which was partially offset by an increase of $1.0 million in interest paid on deposits and borrowings. The increase in net interest income in the 2017 period was primarily due to the increase in the weighted average balance of earning assets which reflected in large part the addition of earning assets acquired as of January 1, 2017 upon completion of the acquisition of Polonia Bancorp, Inc. (“Polonia”). In addition, during calendar 2017, the average balance of loans, excluding loans obtained in the Polonia acquisition, increased $68.8 million with such growth primarily funded through an increase in deposits, the use of FHLB borrowings and the redeployment of excess liquidity. The yield on interest-earning assets increased to 3.66% for the quarter ended December 31, 2017 from 3.33% for the same period in 2016 due primarily to the shift in emphasis to commercial and construction loans, which generally produce higher yields than those obtained on residential loans. The weighted average cost of borrowings and deposits increased to 0.98% during the quarter ended December 31, 2017 from 0.78% during the comparable period in 2016 due to increases in market rates of interest. The net interest margin increased to 2.80% during the quarter ended December 31, 2017 from 2.70% during the comparable period in 2016 due to the increase in the average balance of interest earning assets and the yield earned on those assets.\nNon-Interest Income:\nWith respect to the quarter ended December 31, 2017, non-interest income amounted to $415,000 as compared to $358,000 for the same quarter in fiscal 2017. The primary reason for the higher level of non-interest income in the first quarter of fiscal 2018 was increased earnings from fees and other service charges and transaction fees associated with the Polonia acquisition which was completed during January 2017 and were not included in the operating results for the quarter ended December 31, 2016. The acquisition of Polonia resulted in the addition of five full-service financial centers along with the related customer deposit base.\nNon-Interest Expenses:\nFor the three months ended December 31, 2017, non-interest expense increased $1.3 million, compared to the same period in the prior year. The primary reason for the increase was the additional expense resulting from the Polonia acquisition which added five full-service financial centers to our branch network as well as additional personnel.\nIncome Taxes:\nFor the three-month period ended December 31, 2017, the Company recorded income tax expense of $2.3 million, which included a $1.8 million one-time charge related to a re-evaluation of the Company’s deferred tax assets as a result of the enactment of the Tax Reform Act, compared to income tax expense of $370,000 and an effective tax rate of 33.6% for the same period in 2016. During fiscal 2018, commencing with the quarter ended December 31, 2017, the Company’s statutory income tax rate will be 24.25% as compared to companies which are calendar year tax reporting companies whose statutory rate will decrease to 21% starting January 1, 2018. Effective October 1, 2018, the Company’s statutory tax rate will be reduced to 21%.\nBalance Sheet:\nAt December 31, 2017, the Company had total assets of $933.8 million, as compared to $900.0 million at September 30, 2017, an increase of 3.8%. At December 31, 2017, the investment portfolio increased by $38.3 million primarily as a result of the purchase of investment grade corporate bonds and U.S. government agency mortgage-backed securities. Net loans receivable increased $8.7 million to $580.0 million at December 31, 2017 from $571.3 million at September 30, 2017. These increases were partially offset by an $11.2 million decrease in cash and cash equivalents as available cash was redeployed into higher yielding assets.\nTotal liabilities increased by $37.0 million to $800.3 million at December 31, 2017 from $763.4 million at September 30, 2017. Total deposits increased $16.1 million, consisting primarily of short-term certificates of deposit which were used to fund asset growth as well as meet short-term liquidity needs. At December 31, 2017, the Company had FHLB advances outstanding of $136.9 million, as compared to $114.3 million at September 30, 2017. The increase in the level of borrowings was primarily due to match funding of purchases of investment securities in order to lock in the yield with minimal interest rate risk as part of the Company’s asset/liability management. All of the borrowings had maturities of less than six years.\nTotal stockholders’ equity decreased by $2.8 million to $133.4 million at December 31, 2017 from $136.2 million at September 30, 2017. The decrease was primarily due to a dividend payment of $1.8 million consisting of both an increased regular quarterly dividend of $0.05 per share as well as a special dividend of $0.15 per share. Also contributing to the decrease was a reduction in the fair market value of available for sale securities due to rising market rates of interest as well as the cost of purchases of treasury stock in conjunction with employee benefit plans.\nAsset Quality:\nAt December 31, 2017, the Company’s non-performing assets totaled $16.6 million or 1.8% of total assets as compared to $15.6 million or 1.7% of total assets at September 30, 2017. Non-performing assets at December 31, 2017 included five construction loans aggregating $8.7 million, 26 one-to-four family residential loans aggregating $4.5 million, one single-family residential investment property loan in the amount of $1.4 million and five commercial real estate loans aggregating $1.6 million. Non-performing assets also included at December 31, 2017 three single-family residential properties with an aggregate carrying value of $363,000. At December 31, 2017, the Company had 11 loans aggregating $7.5 million that were classified as troubled debt restructurings (“TDRs”). Seven of such loans aggregating $1.2 million were performing in accordance with the restructured terms as of December 31, 2017 and accruing interest. Three of the TDRs which are classified as non-accrual totaling $4.9 million are a part of a troubled lending relationship totaling $10.7 million (after taking into account the previously disclosed $1.9 million write-down recognized during the quarter ending March 31, 2017 related to this borrowing relationship). The remaining TDR is also on non-accrual and consists of a $1.5 million loan secured by various commercial and residential properties. The primary project of the borrower (the development of a 169-unit townhouse project in Bristol Borough, Pennsylvania) is the subject of litigation between the Bank and the borrower and as a result, the project currently is not proceeding. Subsequent to the commencement of the litigation previously disclosed, the borrower filed for bankruptcy under Chapter 11 (Reorganization) of the federal bankruptcy code in June 2017. The Bank has moved the underlying litigation noted above with the borrower and the Bank from state court to the federal bankruptcy court in which the bankruptcy proceeding is being heard. The state litigation is stayed pending the resolution of the bankruptcy proceedings. The Bank successfully moved to have portions of the bankruptcy proceedings converted to Chapter 7 (Liquidation). As of September 30, 2017, the Company had reviewed $23.9 million of loans for possible impairment compared to $19.7 million reviewed for possible impairment as of September 30, 2017.\nThe Company recorded a provision for loan losses in the amount of $210,000 for the three months ended December 31, 2017, primarily due to the growth in the loan portfolio as well as the continued shift in its composition, compared to a provision for loan losses of $185,000 for the same period in 2016. During the three months ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, the Company did not record any recoveries or charge offs.\nThe allowance for loan losses totaled $4.7 million, or 0.8% of total loans and 28.9% of total non-performing loans (which included loans acquired from Polonia at their fair-value) at December 31, 2017 as compared to $4.5 million, or 0.8% of total loans and 29.0% of total non-performing loans at September 30, 2017. The Company believes that the allowance for loan losses at December 31, 2017 was sufficient to cover all inherent and known losses associated with the loan portfolio at such date.\nAbout Prudential Bancorp, Inc.:\nPrudential Bancorp, Inc. is the holding company for Prudential Bank.
