Local party branches in the states of Saxony-Anhalt and Berlin have both also rebuked the leadership with symbolic votes against a tie-up.\nEven if the 600 delegates vote to authorize talks on Sunday, Schulz’s team has one more hurdle to clear. The party’s 443,000 members must vote in a postal ballot to approve the final coalition deal before the SPD can agree to join a government.\nFollowing is a list of key stages in the SPD’s ratification process.\nREGIONAL PARTIES The SPD’s regional branches in Saxony-Anhalt and Berlin have both voted against opening coalition talks, but they are minnows compared with the branches in its western German heartlands. Furthermore, delegates are free to vote their consciences, unconstrained by their regional parties.\nCAMPAIGNING Supporters and opponents of the deal are criss-crossing the country trying to win delegates to their cause ahead of Sunday’s congress. Schulz and most of the 45 members of the party’s presidium back a deal. Six of them oppose it and are joined by other groups, including the Jusos, the party’s youth wing.\nSchulz was in Dortmund on Monday, urging delegates from North Rhine-Westphalia, the largest branch of the party, to back the deal, and leaders can be expected to focus further lobbying on the delegates from Lower Saxony, the second-largest branch.\nAlthough the party’s leftist groups broadly oppose the deal, some are nonetheless in favor of authorizing talks, arguing that it is for the party’s broad membership to decide if they want to reject or accept a final deal.\nSchulz also has the support of trade unions and the municipalities, which have largely welcomed the deal.\nCONGRESS The 600 delegates and 45 presidium members vote at Sunday’s congress in the former West German capital of Bonn. Thirty-two of the presidium members have already voted in favor of talks, six against.\nThe North Rhine-Westphalia branch will have the greatest weight at the congress, contributing 144 of the 600 delegates. It will be followed by Lower Saxony, contributing 81 delegates. Failure to carry these two branches could be fatal to the deal.\nThe Jusos youth organization, the largest group to have announced its opposition, which represents all members aged below 35, will have 80 to 90 delegates.\nPOSTAL BALLOT Assuming talks go ahead and yield a final coalition agreement, Schulz has pledged to ask the SPD’s 443,000 members in a postal ballot if they back a renewed coalition.\nReporting by Holger Hansen; Writing by Thomas Escritt; Editing by Hugh Lawson\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-01-16T23:22:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-17T20:10:39.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
