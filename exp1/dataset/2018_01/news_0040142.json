REUTERS/Adam Hunger/File Photo \nD.A. Davidson analyst Linda Bolton Weiser said she expected the store closures to hit barbie-maker Mattel’s 2018 estimated sales growth by 1.5-2 percent, assuming shipments that would have gone to Toys “R” Us are not picked up by other retailers. \nFor Hasbro, the impact would be slightly less, with Weiser estimating a 1-1.5 percent hit to its 2018 estimated sales. The maker of Monopoly board game gets about 9 percent of its revenue from the toy retailer. \nWall Street analysts have forecast a 1 percent drop in 2018 sales for Mattel, but a 3 percent rise for Hasbro. \nToys “R” Us, which also operates the infant- and toddler-focused Babies “R” Us chain, has set aside more than $400 million out of its $3.1 billion in bankruptcy loans for sprucing up stores over the next three years with more experiences and better-paid staff. \nThe company said it plans to remodel a number of locations by converting them into co-branded Toys R Us and Babies R Us stores, while also investing in websites. \nAll 83 Toys \"R\" Us stores in Canada will remain open, said president of the Canadian unit, Melanie Teed-Murch, in a letter to customers. bit.ly/2n7ztCp \nAs Toys “R” Us aims to exit bankruptcy in 2018, its efforts to reinvent its stores will shape how other retailers look to experiential shopping to tackle e-commerce.
