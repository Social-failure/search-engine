It was extended in July and again in October.\nPresident Abdel Fattah al-Sisi, who is widely expected to run for a second term in an election due early this year, issued a decree on Tuesday to extend the state of emergency.\nThe latest extension was to allow security forces to “take (measures) necessary to confront the dangers and funding of terrorism and safeguard security in all parts of the country,” MENA reported, citing Egypt’s official gazette.\nEgypt faces an Islamic State insurgency in the remote North Sinai region that has killed hundreds of soldiers and policemen in recent years and has expanded to include attacks on civilians.\nOther Islamists operating in the western desert bordering Libya have also attacked security forces.\nAttacks south of Cairo in the past week, one of them claimed by Islamic State, have targeted Christians.\nThe election date is to be announced next Monday, local media reported.\nReporting by Ahmed Tolba and John Davison; Editing by Gareth Jones\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-02T17:38:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-02T17:50:05.009+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
