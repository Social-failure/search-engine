Analysts on average expected revenue of $518.8 million. \nThe company said fourth-quarter freight demand was strong for its truckload services, or contracts for an entire trailer-load to a single customer, with much stronger-than-normal freight volumes so far in January. \n“Freight metrics are improving, and we have increasing confidence that contractual rates will strengthen over the next few quarters,” the company said in a statement accompanying earnings. \nThe company also benefited from changes to U.S. tax law. \nIts fourth quarter and annual profits included a $110.5 million non-cash reduction in income tax expense and it said it estimates full-year 2018 effective income tax rate to be between 25-26 percent. \nAs a result of the new tax law, Werner said it expects net capital expenditures for 2018 will be in the range of $300 million to $350 million, which allows for increased investments in its tractor and trailer fleet.
