It came in real fast,” Kaiaua resident Diana Gausden told the New Zealand Herald.\nNew Zealand’s largest city, Auckland, was pummeled by two months’ worth of rain in 24 hours, according to the National Institute of Water and Atmospheric Research, prompting authorities to shut major roads and cancel ferry services and dozens of flights.\nWinds of up to 128 kph (80 mph) an hour tore off roofs, felled trees and ripped boats from their moorings overnight, according to media.\nMore than 20,000 households had been left without power on Friday, including 12,000 in Auckland, according to media.\nElectricity providers said they were working to fix dozens of separate power outages centering on Auckland.\nThe storm was a dramatic interlude in an unusually dry summer, which has led to drought in many farming regions and curbed production of milk.\nEditing by Rosalba O'Brien and Nick Macfie\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-05T00:15:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-05T00:32:45.017+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
