Given that U.S. share prices have rallied strongly since the beginning of the year, we have to see if this event is a trigger to change the market trend,” said Takafumi Yamawaki, head of Japan fixed income research at JPMorgan Securities.\nHe noted that during previous government shutdowns - two in 1995 and one in 2013 - U.S. bond yields have tended to slip in the first few weeks after the closure.\nHowever, this time U.S. bond prices dropped, lifting their yields, with the 10-year U.S. Treasuries hitting a 3 1/2-year high of 2.663 percent.\nIn the foreign exchange market, the dollar’s index against a basket of major currencies dropped about 0.2 percent from late last week to 90.465, edging back towards its three-year low of 90.104 touched on Wednesday.\nThe euro rose to 0.2 percent to $1.2245, though it stopped short of testing Wednesday’s three-year peak of $1.2323.\nThe common currency was also helped after Germany’s Social Democrats (SPD) voted on Sunday to begin formal coalition talks with Chancellor Angela Merkel’s conservatives, moving Europe’s economic powerhouse closer to a stable government after months of political deadlock.\nThe safe-haven Swiss franc gained 0.3 percent to 0.9627 franc per dollar. It hit a four-month high of 0.9536 to the dollar.\nThe Japanese yen gained 0.2 percent to 110.63 yen to the dollar, coming within sight of Wednesday’s four-month high of 110.19 while gold ticked up 0.2 percent to $1,334.5 per ounce.\nThe South African rand was the biggest mover in early Asian trade, rising almost 1 percent to 2-1/2-year highs of 12.0825 per dollar.\nLeaders of South Africa’s ruling African National Congress (ANC) met on Saturday to outline the party’s programme for the coming year amid reports that its executive planned to force Jacob Zuma to quit as the country’s president.\nMoving in the opposite direction, the Turkish lira eased 0.6 percent to 3.8280 after Turkey’s army and rebel allies battled U.S.-backed Kurdish militia in northern Syria, in a campaign that has opened a new front in Syria’s civil war.\nOil prices ticked up after having snapped a four-week winning streak on profit-taking. U.S. crude futures traded at $63.49 per barrel, up 0.2 percent from late last week.\nThe global benchmark Brent futures advanced 0.2 percent to fetch $68.77 per barrel.\nEditing by Shri Navaratnam\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-01-22T09:04:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-22T05:53:41.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
