REUTERS/Steve Marcus \nTrade tension is rising because of U.S. demands to renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement and virtual paralysis in the WTO dispute system, caused by a U.S. veto on new judges at what is effectively the world trade supreme court. \nSouth Korea said it was demanding compensation because the United States had failed to meet a Dec. 26 deadline to comply with a ruling against duties of up to 82 percent it had imposed on appliances made by Samsung Electronics Co ( 005930.KS ), LG Electronics Inc ( 066570.KS ) and Daewoo Electronics Co. \nEarlier on Friday, the United States and South Korea formally accepted a WTO ruling in a separate dispute over U.S. duties on South Korean steel pipe used in oil drilling, according to transcripts of statements at the WTO’s dispute settlement meeting. \nSouth Korea’s representative expressed disappointment that the ruling had not recognized “the magnitude of U.S. political pressure” - including letters from over 50 senators and 150 members of the House of Representatives - that prompted the U.S. Department of Commerce to drastically beef up its claim against South Korea. \nSouth Korea’s Trade Ministry is also considering filing a WTO complaint over U.S. restrictions on solar panel imports, it said in November.
