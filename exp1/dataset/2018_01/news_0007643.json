The first two approved CAR-T treatments for other cancers from Novartis and Gilead Sciences were priced at $475,000 and $373,000, respectively, for the one-time treatments.\nAs bluebird progresses toward a portfolio of potentially game-changing commercial treatments, Leschly said one of his overriding principles is: “Don’t do stupid shortsighted stuff.”\n“We haven’t done anything yet,” Leschly said. “We need to deliver products to patients.”\nReporting by Bill Berkrot; Editing by Tom Brown\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-09T20:44:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-09T21:33:54.024+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
