For many people, this might be their only time to ever be invited to the White House,” Ryan told the Chronicle of the Astros’ plans. \n“And as the representatives of baseball and the World Series champs, when the White House calls and invites you to come up, it’s something that as an organization we felt both a responsibility and an obligation to be part of.” \nThis does not necessarily mean every member of Houston’s World Series-winning team will go. \nThe New England Patriots visited the White House after winning the Super Bowl earlier this year, but several team members skipped the trip. \nHouston third baseman Alex Bregman, who called Trump a “joke” before the 2016 presidential election, was recently asked whether he would accept an invitation. \n“I don’t know. I‘m gonna do whatever Carlos Beltran and Carlos Correa do,” Bregman said, referring to two of the team’s players from Puerto Rico. \nReporting by Andrew Both in Cary, North Carolina; editing by Amlan Chakraborty\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-01-04T12:58:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-04T07:56:36.010+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
