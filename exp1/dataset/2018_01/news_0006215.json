The figures were first reported by Bloomberg. \nOdey came to prominence during the 2008 financial crisis when he shorted banking shares, a lucrative wager that helped him to earn almost 28 million pounds ($38 million) that year. \nMore recently, however, his fund’s performance has suffered heavily after he took a negative stance on the outlook for the global economy and bearish positions against shares that have not borne fruit. \nHis flagship fund experienced its worst-ever losses of almost 50 percent in 2016, a year that Odey has since described as awful. \nHis eponymous firm, Odey Asset Management, also saw its performance fees plunge to 60,000 pounds in the 12 months to April 5 2017, from 19.3 million pounds in the same period a year earlier, according to a company filing last month. \nOperating profits dropped to 18.6 million pounds from 44.3 million in 2016, the filing showed.
