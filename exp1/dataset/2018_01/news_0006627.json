Sectors such as manufacturing and hotels were badly hit, she said. A woman labourer rests on a pile of stones at a construction site, in Mumbai, India March 16, 2017.

Farm output may slow to 2.1 percent from 4.9 percent. FILE PHOTO - A labourer pulls an underground cable at a construction site of a commercial complex in Mumbai January 20, 2011.
