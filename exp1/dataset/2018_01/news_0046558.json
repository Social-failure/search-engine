I don’t want to be involved with [these] people, but you’re telling me about these people because I know nothing about these people.”\nJayda Fransen, deputy leader of anti-immigration Britain First, posted the videos which she said showed a group of people who were Muslims beating a teenage boy to death, battering a boy on crutches and destroying a Christian statue.\nBut relations between the two nations, described as “the special relationship”, have faced several ups and downs not just due to Trump’s criticism of May, but also his spats with London Mayor Sadiq Khan and his comments on militant attacks in Britain.\nEarlier this month, he cancelled a trip to London to open a new embassy, saying he did not want to endorse a bad deal agreed by the Obama administration to sell the old one for “peanuts”.\nSome Britons are angry at the prospect of a visit by Trump with large protests expected when he does arrive, most probably in the second half of the year according to a senior British government source.\nOfficials are discussing whether Trump will be given a state visit, which means he will be hosted by Queen Elizabeth, and when exactly it will take place, the source said.\nIn the interview aired on Friday, Trump said he loved Britain very much and got along well with May.\n“I can tell you I have a very good relationship with your Prime Minister,” Trump said. “She’s been doing a very good job. We actually have a very good relationship, although a lot of people think we don’t.”\n“I support her, I support a lot of what she does and a lot of what she says and I support you militarily very much. We will come to your defence if anything should happen, which hopefully will never happen. I am a tremendous supporter of the UK.”\nWriting by Guy Faulconbridge and Costas Pitas; editing by Kate Holton and William Maclean\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-26T09:04:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-26T09:21:59.025+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
