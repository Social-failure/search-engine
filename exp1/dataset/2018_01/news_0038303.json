REUTERS/Daniel Becerril \nThe PAN has entered into an electoral alliance with the center-left Party of the Democratic Revolution (PRD), with former PAN leader Ricardo Anaya at its head. \nThe coalition has put a squeeze on the number of safe seats the PRD and PAN can each distribute among leading politicians. \nLopez Obrador, or AMLO as he is commonly known, has vowed to combat inequality and corruption. But some international investors are concerned by suggestions that he might reverse parts of the government’s 2013-14 energy legislation, which ended a decades-long monopoly by state oil firm Pemex. \nAnaya’s coalition is second in opinion polls. \nPRI contender Jose Antonio Meade is in third place, weighed down by the PRI’s poor record on corruption.
