Earnings per share increase was impacted as a result of 447,000 new shares offered in the successful $6 million capital raise in the first quarter of 2017.\nEarnings for the 4 th quarter were negatively affected by $0.08 per share in additional federal income tax expense associated with the passage of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 which became effective in December 2017. As a result, earnings for Q4 2017 were $605 thousand or $0.15 per fully diluted share compared to Q4 2016 earnings of $759 thousand or $0.21 per fully diluted share.\n“Like many other banks across the nation, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 had a negative impact in 4 th quarter of 2017; however, we anticipate the Act will reduce our marginal tax rate in 2018 to 28% from 38%,” said Craig Wanichek, President and CEO. “The additional benefit from the Act will also result in a greater capacity to continue to make economic investments in our two primary markets of Eugene/Springfield and Central Oregon.”\nSummit achieved its fifth consecutive year of annual loan growth in excess of 20% during 2017. Total net loans as of December 31, 2017, were $276.5 million, representing a 21.8% increase over the fiscal 2016 total of $227.0 million. Total assets at the end of the year were $336 million, an increase of 19.0% over total assets of $282 million at the end of 2016. Deposit growth was similarly strong, with total deposits increasing by $44.9 million or 17.7% over the previous year.\n“Our clients’ growth this past year added significantly to our progress in 2017,” said Wanichek. “But, the addition of key new relationships helped us achieve the loan growth in excess of 20%. Our strong balance sheet position has also allowed us to increase rates for our depositors twice over the last seven months.”\nThe Bank reported $47.0 million of cash & short-term investments in securities at the end of 2017. This is a 9.3% increase over $43.2 million held in cash & short-term investments in securities at the end of 2016. The Bank continues to hold very low levels of non-performing assets. Total non-performing assets at December 31, 2017 consisted primarily of one parcel of other real estate owned and represented just 0.4 percent of total assets, a reduction from 0.5 percent at December 31, 2016.\nWith offices in Eugene and Bend, Summit Bank is a business bank that specializes in providing high-level service to professionals and medium-sized businesses and their owners.
