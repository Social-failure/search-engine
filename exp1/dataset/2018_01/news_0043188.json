The charge encompasses several elements, including a tax on the deemed repatriation of previously untaxed accumulated earnings and profits of its foreign subsidiaries, and the remeasurement of its deferred tax assets arising from a lower U.S. corporate tax rate. In addition, the company recorded a reduction to income tax expense of $11.5 million, or $0.36 per share, related to excess tax benefits associated with stock compensation.\nNet cash provided by operating activities for the quarter was $28.8 million versus $33.0 million in the prior year period.\nFirst Quarter Fiscal 2018 Non-GAAP Results\nNon-GAAP Net Income for the quarter was $41.1 million vs. $33.5 million in the prior year period.

Our management believes these non-GAAP financial measures provide meaningful supplemental information regarding our performance and liquidity by excluding certain items that may not be indicative of recurring business results including significant non-cash expenses. We believe management and investors benefit from referring to these non-GAAP financial measures in assessing our performance when planning, forecasting and analyzing future periods. These non-GAAP financial measures also facilitate management's internal comparisons to historical performance and liquidity as well as comparisons to our competitors' operating results. We believe these non-GAAP financial measures are useful to investors because they allow for greater transparency with respect to key measures used by management in its financial and operating decision-making.\nFAIR ISAAC CORPORATION\nRECONCILIATION OF NON-GAAP GUIDANCE\n(In millions, except per share data)\n(Unaudited)\nPrevious Fiscal 2018\nGuidance without\nExcess Tax Benefit\nTax Reform Rate\nImpact\nTax Items\nFiscal 2018 Guidance\nGAAP net income\n$ 119\n$ 14\n$ 3\n$ 136\nAmortization of intangible assets\n7\n-\n-\n7\nStock-based compensation expense\n67\n-\n-\n67\nIncome tax adjustments\n(22)\n6\n-\n(16)\nExcess tax benefit\n-\n-\n(20)\n(20)\nTax Cuts and Jobs Act\n-\n-\n17\n17\nNon-GAAP net income\n$ 171\n$ 20\n$ -\n$ 191\nGAAP diluted earnings per share\n$ 3.71\n$ 0.44\n$ 0.10\n$ 4.34\nAmortization of intangible assets\n0.22\n-\n-\n0.22\nStock-based compensation expense\n2.09\n-\n-\n2.14\nIncome tax adjustments\n(0.69)\n0.19\n-\n(0.52)\nExcess tax benefit\n-\n-\n(0.64)\n(0.64)\nTax Cuts and Jobs Act\n-\n-\n0.54\n0.54\nNon-GAAP diluted earnings per share\n$ 5.32\n$ 0.63\n$ -\n$ 6.09\nNote: The numbers may not sum to total due to rounding.\nAbout Non-GAAP Financial Measures\nTo supplement the consolidated GAAP financial statements, the company uses the following non-GAAP financial measures: non-GAAP net income, non-GAAP EPS, and free cash flow.
