His dismissal led to Mueller’s appointment to take over the FBI probe and is central to whether Trump may have committed obstruction of justice. \nMueller also asked the officials if Trump tried to shut down intelligence investigations into Russian election meddling and into contacts between Russian officials connected with President Vladimir Putin’s government and associates of Trump or his campaign, the sources said on condition of anonymity. \nPompeo’s questioning was first reported by NBC News on Wednesday, a day after the Justice Department said Mueller’s office questioned Attorney General Jeff Sessions last week. \nDiscussions have been under way about the possibility of Mueller’s team interviewing Trump, according to a person familiar with the talks. \nComey told congressional investigators in June that Trump had demanded his loyalty, asked him to drop a probe into former national security adviser Michael Flynn and repeatedly pressed him to announce publicly that Trump was not under investigation. \nFlynn has since pleaded guilty to a charge brought by Mueller of lying to the Federal Bureau of Investigation. \nMueller’s office interviewed Comey shortly after he was fired, a source close to the investigation told Reuters. \nRepresentatives for the CIA declined to comment on whether Pompeo had been interviewed. \nU.S. intelligence agencies have concluded that Russia interfered in the 2016 campaign using hacking and propaganda to try to tilt the race in Trump’s favour. Russia has denied it. Trump has denied collusion with Russia and calls the probe a witch hunt. After Comey’s accusation in June about the circumstances of his firing, Trump also denied any obstruction of justice. \nFormer White House strategist and Trump campaign aide Steve Bannon is expected to be questioned by Mueller’s team about Flynn and Comey by the end of the month, NBC and CNN reported.
