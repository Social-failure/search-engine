We design biologics to engage and modulate the activity of disease-associated T cells in the patient’s body, offering significant therapeutic advantages while potentially minimizing or eliminating unwanted side effects.\nWe believe our biologics allow us to target antigen-specific T cell populations in a variety of indications using a simple peptide exchange within previously-validated drug frameworks developed from the Cue Biologics Platform™. This flexibility could truncate the drug selection and development process, moving effective therapeutics from discovery to clinical validation more rapidly and cost efficiently than current industry standard timelines and costs.\nHeadquartered in Kendall Square, Cambridge, MA, we are led by an experienced management team and scientific and clinical advisory board (SAB/CAB) with deep expertise in the design and clinical development of protein biologics, immunology and immuno-oncology.\nFor more information, visit www.cuebio.com .\nAbout MDB Capital Group\nMDB Capital Group sponsors scientists and entrepreneurs that possess meaningful technology which has the potential to impact significant commercial markets and benefit humanity.
