Reach her on Messenger to share your thoughts on market moves: kit.rees.thomsonreuters.com@reuters.net CLOSING SNAPSHOT: STOXX 600 IN STRIKING DISTANCE OF ALL TIME HIGH (1715 GMT) If it continues at this pace, the STOXX 600 is bound to hit its all time high in the next couple of weeks. At 397.35 points, it needs about 4.5% to beat the 415.18 points it reached on April 15 2015. Here's your closing snapshot and see you on Monday: (Julien Ponthus) MIFID II TAKEAWAYS: INBOX DECLOGGING (1615 GMT) Among the takeaways of the brave new MIFID II world, here's what a fund manager told us today: \"The main consequence is that my inbox is no longer saturated\" by research, he said, adding that he had stuck with his main brokers and was happy to no longer receive a flurry of notes that he would read \"twice a year\". (Julien Ponthus) EUROPEAN STOCKS EXTEND GAINS AS WALL ST SCORES A HAT TRICK (1505 GMT) Three indexes, three new records. That's Wall St for you this afternoon. And it's all being driven by our good friend tech. European stocks have also extended gains, with the STOXX 600 up 0.7 percent. Here's your U.S. snapshot: (Kit Rees) BAYER SET FOR BEST DAY IN A YEAR AS INVESTORS EYE MONSANTO DEAL CLOSURE (1438 GMT) Bayer is working up to be one of the star performers of the day, with gains of 4.5 percent setting it up for its strongest day in more than a year as some analysts see its mammoth deal with Monsanto nearing closure. The move up in Bayer took some traders by surprise following pre-market calls for the stock to fall after India's regulator started a public consultation on the deal. Rising optimism that the acquisition of the U.S. grains giant will close soon likely buoyed it higher. \"The probability of deal closure in Q1 has risen in our view following press reports Bayer is exploring the sale of additional assets to satisfy EU/US regulators,\" Citi analysts say. \"We continue to see the risk-reward as compelling.\" That's despite Monsanto's profit missing estimates yesterday. (Helen Reid) MORGAN STANLEY RECKONS EUROPEAN EQUITIES ARE DUE A CATCH-UP (1434 GMT) Interesting. Morgan Stanley's European equity strategists say they had expected European stocks to outperform their global counterparts in recent months due to the region's more cyclical makeup. But even though bond yields have been higher and inflation expectations have risen, Europe hasn't outperformed, even when comparing markets in USD (see MS' chart below). \"While European yields haven't risen as much as those in the US, they are still rising, and investors have been seeing negative total returns in the shorter end of the bund curve since last February,\" MS' European strategy team says in a note. \"We think European equities are due a catch up.\" (Kit Rees) ARE H&M'S DAYS AS A GROWTH STORY NUMBERED? (1404 GMT) The Swedish fashion giant hit by a price target cut from Morgan Stanley is trading down 1.5 percent with the market abuzz over the bank's remarkably pessimistic note. \"H&M remains our key, and highest conviction, Underweight,\" MS analysts say. They reckon H&M's full-year profits reported later this month will be little higher than those a decade ago, and with fewer future store openings too \"the days of consensus assuming that a 'return to growth' is just around the corner are coming to an end\". H&M shares are now sagging far behind rival Inditex. The Zara owner has also slipped somewhat over the past 12 months, but Northern Trust Capital Markets' head of global equities Gary Paulin reckons it still has a competitive advantage over H&M. \"Inditex's somewhat unique and hitherto unchallenged model (based on speed to market and lean inventories) remains intact, we think,\" he writes. (Helen Reid) U.S. NON-FARM PAYROLLS DISAPPOINT, EUROPEAN STOCKS REACTION LIMITED (1344 GMT) It's the moment we've all been waiting for today: U.S. non-farm payrolls. They missed, coming in at 148K for December while expectations had them down for 190K. There was the briefest of moves on the STOXX 600, with the index trimming gains slightly but back up at +0.6 percent so nothing major. Here are some thoughts from Twitter: (Kit Rees) LEAD US NOT INTO TEMPTATION-A CASE FOR RESISTING THE BULLS (1307 GMT) Amundi, one of the world's top asset managers, is sounding a warning as the bulls of 2017 stampede their way into the new year. \"Moving into 2018, the temptation for risk assets is still high\", Amundi's top investment officers said in a note, urging investors to \"resist the temptation to aggressively increase risk\" as the \"Goldilocks‚Äù era may come to an end. \"The economic sweet spot will likely end up in higher interest rates, therefore reducing windows of opportunities in the most crowded areas of the market\", it said. Last Quote: : \"Expensive valuations across the board, areas of complacency, liquidity conditions, the challenges ahead in terms of interest rate normalization, and geopolitical risks could result in a very uneven market performance\". Here's temptation (albeit old school): (Julien Ponthus) UBS FINDS IMPROVEMENT IN IPHONE X DEMAND (1140 GMT) Given the concerns around demand for Apple's iPhone X, which hit European chipmakers at the end of last year, analysts at UBS have taken a look at the issue in their survey. In short, UBS found an improvement in demand. \"Despite supply chain volatility, fundamental iPhone demand appears to have improved post the iPhone X launch,\" UBS analysts said in a note. \"This provides confidence in our iPhone estimates and could even mean upside to ASPs (average selling price) for Apple given the higher implied mix towards the iPhone X.\" While UBS analysts are positive on Apple and Samsung, they're \"more balanced\" on the supply chain. (Kit Rees) \"HAPPY BULLISH YEAR EU (27 THAT IS, NOT THE OTHER ONE)\" (1113 GMT) A cheeky putdown to the UK there from BAML whose European econ note highlights the UK's lag compared to the euro zone's stellar performance with manufacturing PMIs at an all time high and Q4 GDP growth tracking 0.7 percent quarter-on-quarter. \"The UK's relative underperformance makes the Brexit shock clear and this week's PMIs don't suggest much change to that position,\" BAML strategists say. On whether progress in Brexit talks could help alleviate the shock to the economy, they reckon the answer so far is no. The lag in economic growth is reflected in stocks, with the FTSE still behind its estranged EU family despite the recent commodities boost: (Helen Reid) WHAT IS NOT A CRYPTO AND IS UP OVER 80 PERCENT in 2018? (1043 GMT) It's Steinhoff! One has to admit however that yesterday evening's headline is not exactly the kind that usually fuels exuberance across trading floors, but there you go: Steinhoff CFO steps down as crisis-hit retailer shuffles top team Here's the chart: (Julien Ponthus) MINING SECTOR \"", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-05T12:24:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-05T12:46:52.002+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
