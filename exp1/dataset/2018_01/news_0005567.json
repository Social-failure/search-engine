Shaun Marsh was two not out at lunch. \nAustralia had resumed on 193 for two and Khawaja wasted no time in knocking off the nine runs he needed to secure his sixth test century. \nAfter cutting Moeen for two runs, he pumped his fist in celebration at reaching the milestone before doffing his helmet to receive the ovation of a packed crowd at what was once his home ground. \nKhawaja, a fine stroke-player but considered suspect against spin bowling, made his debut at the SCG in the corresponding Ashes clash eight years ago but has had a stop-start career in the baggy green. \nDebutant England leg-spinner Mason Crane tested the 31-year-oldâ€™s skill against the turning ball to its limits in the final over before lunch. \nFirst the 20-year-old came up just short of sending the batsman back to join his captain caught and bowled and, two balls later, emitted a huge shout for lbw. \nThe umpire declined the appeal and England skipper Joe Root called for a review only for the TV pictures to show Crane had overstepped the mark and bowled a no-ball. \nAustralia won back the Ashes with victories in the first three matches in Brisbane, Adelaide and Perth with the fourth test in Melbourne finishing in a draw last week.
