Analysts in a Thomson Reuters poll had forecast on average full-year revenues of 1.08 billion euros.\nSafilo is the world’s second-largest eyewear group after Luxottica, which on Monday reported a 2 percent rise in 2017 sales to 9.16 billion euros on a strong fourth quarter.\nFurther adding pressure on Safilo, Luxottica is expected to get a green light soon from U.S. and EU anti-trust authorities for its 50-billion-euro merger with top lens manufacturer Essilor\nRejecting speculation in the Italian press that Safilo may soon become a takeover target amid intensifying competition, a spokeswoman for the group said on Monday that top investor HAL Holding had no plan at present to change its stake.\nSafilo, which has also just lost its licence for LVMH’s Celine brand, reported a 3.7 percent fall in fourth-quarter sales of its “going forward” brands, meaning excluding brands that Safilo has stopped or will stop selling under licence.\nFollowing in Kering’s footsteps, LVMH bought a 10 percent stake in Marcolin last year. The partnership between the world’s largest luxury goods group and Marcolin could cost Safilo other LVMH licenses, including the prized Dior brand. The Dior licence expires in 2020.\nSafilo said sales of Dior-branded spectacles fell in 2017 after several years of strong growth.
