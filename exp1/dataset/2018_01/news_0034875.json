REUTERS/Issei Kato \n“I know what it feels like to be Andy Murray for the last eight years or however long,” Edmund said of the spotlight now on him after his incredible run in Melbourne. \nDimitrov was heavy favourite after his superb fourth-round defeat of home favourite Nick Kyrgios but the portents were not good when he dropped serve in the opening game. \n“Today was just one of those days, I just couldn’t find a way,” Dimitrov, still awaiting his first major final, said.

But the silky Bulgarian never looked comfortable against an ultra aggressive opponent and a double-fault at 3-4 in the third set proved costly. \nThe players swapped breaks in the fourth but Dimitrov was winning only half his first-serve points and the pressure finally told as a backhand error gave Edmund a break at 4-4. \nIn a tense final game, Edmund double-faulted but an ace brought up match point before Dimitrov sliced long. \n“I am loving it right now, just the way I‘m playing,” Edmund told reporters. “I‘m 23 years old, my first grand slam semi-final. First time I played on one of the biggest courts in the world. To beat a quality of player like Grigor. They’re great feelings.” Editing by Ed Osmond", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-23T08:52:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-23T09:10:49.012+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
