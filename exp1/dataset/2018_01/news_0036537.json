Return on stock investment in 2017 hit 118.4 billion yuan, up 355.5 percent, while return on bonds reached 208.7 billion yuan over the same period, up 11.07 percent on-year. $1 = 6.4061 Chinese yuan Reporting by Shu Zhang and Matthew Miller in Beijing; Writing by Engen Tham in Shanghai; Editing by Shri Navaratnam and Sam Holmes", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-22T11:26:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-22T12:01:50.032+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
