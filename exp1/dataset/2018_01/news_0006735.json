He forecasts unemployment will stay low this year before rising a few tenths of a percentage point next year, and inflation to push above 2 percent in 2019 before coming back to the Fed’s target in 2020. There is “little slack” left in the labour market, he said.\nBut, he said, “if soft inflation persists, it may pose a significant problem,” including making it more difficult to bring inflation back to target.\nReporting by Ann Saphir and Jonathan Spicer; Editing by Chizu Nomiyama\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-05T21:53:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-05T22:04:32.002+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
