(NYSE:TER) reported revenue of $479 million for the fourth quarter of 2017 of which $317 million was in Semiconductor Test, $80 million in System Test, $54 million in Industrial Automation, and $28 million in Wireless Test. GAAP net loss for the fourth quarter was ($105.9) million or ($0.54) per share. GAAP results include a $184 million discrete tax charge related to the impact of U.S. tax policy changes 1 . On a non-GAAP basis, Teradyne’s net income in the fourth quarter was $91.4 million, or $0.46 per diluted share, which excluded acquired intangible asset amortization, pension actuarial gains, restructuring and other charges, non-cash convertible debt interest, discrete income tax adjustments, and included the related tax impact on non-GAAP adjustments.\nOrders in the fourth quarter of 2017 were $560 million of which $410 million were in Semiconductor Test, $69 million in System Test, $56 million in Industrial Automation, and $24 million in Wireless Test.\n\"The fourth quarter capped off a great 2017 at Teradyne. In Q4, Semi Test sales were up 17% compared to Q4 of 2016 and up 22% for the full year,” said CEO and President Mark Jagiela. “Universal Robots Q4 sales grew 61% from Q4’16 and 72% for the full year driven by increased awareness of the economic advantages of our cobots for an expanded range of applications. Overall, the total company grew 22% in sales and 55% in non-GAAP EPS in 2017.\"\n\"Turning to 2018, at the mid-point of the Q1 revenue guidance, we see 4% growth over Q1 of 2017. Our view of the 2018 SemiTest market outlook has also strengthened slightly since our October estimate. On the capital allocation front, the combination of a strong business outlook and U.S. tax reform support our plan to raise our quarterly dividend by 29% to $0.09 cents per share and initiate a $1.5 billion share repurchase program with expected repurchases of $750 million in 2018.\"\nTeradyne’s Board of Directors approved the share repurchase program authorizing the Company to repurchase up to $1.5 billion of its common stock through open market purchases or private transactions. The $1.5 billion authorization replaces the Company’s existing $500 million repurchase authorization announced in December 2016.\nTeradyne’s Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.09 per share, payable on March 23, 2018 to shareholders of record as of the close of business on February 23, 2018.\nGuidance for the first quarter of 2018 is revenue of $460 million to $490 million, with GAAP net income of $0.32 to $0.39 per diluted share and non-GAAP net income of $0.38 to $0.45 per diluted share. Non-GAAP guidance excludes acquired intangible asset amortization, non-cash convertible debt interest, restructuring and other charges and includes the related tax impact on non-GAAP adjustments.\n1 Amount represents the estimated impact of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which may change as additional guidance and information become available.\nWebcast\nA conference call to discuss the fourth quarter results, along with management's business outlook, will follow at 10 a.m. ET, Thursday, January 25.

These results are provided as a complement to results provided in accordance with GAAP. Non-GAAP income from operations and non-GAAP net income exclude acquired intangible assets amortization, non-cash convertible debt interest, pension actuarial gains and losses, discrete income tax adjustments, goodwill impairment, acquired intangible assets impairment, and restructuring and other. GAAP requires that these items be included in determining income from operations and net income. Non-GAAP income from operations, non-GAAP net income, non-GAAP income from operations and non-GAAP net income as a percentage of revenue, and non-GAAP net income per share are non-GAAP performance measures presented to provide meaningful supplemental information regarding Teradyne’s baseline performance before gains, losses or other charges that may not be indicative of Teradyne’s current core business or future outlook. These non-GAAP performance measures are used to make operational decisions, to determine employee compensation, to forecast future operational results, and for comparison with Teradyne’s business plan, historical operating results and the operating results of Teradyne’s competitors. Non-GAAP gross margin excludes pension actuarial gains and losses. GAAP requires that these items be included in determining gross margin. Non-GAAP gross margin dollar amount and percentage are non-GAAP performance measures that management believes provide useful supplemental information for management and the investor. Management uses non-GAAP gross margin as a performance measure for Teradyne’s current core business and future outlook and for comparison with Teradyne’s business plan, historical gross margin results and the gross margin results of Teradyne’s competitors. Management believes each of these non-GAAP performance measures provides useful supplemental information for investors, allowing greater transparency to the information used by management in its operational decision making and in the review of Teradyne’s financial and operational performance, as well as facilitating meaningful comparisons of Teradyne’s results in the current period compared with those in prior and future periods.
