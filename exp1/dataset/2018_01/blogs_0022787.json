The market was closed on Monday for a U.S. holiday. \n* The USDA estimated 2018 winter wheat plantings at 32.608 million acres, the smallest since 1909 but above analysts' expectations for 30.100 million to 32.000 million. \n* The most active soybean futures were up 0.4 percent at $9.64-3/4 a bushel, having earlier hit a high of $9.67-3/4 a bushel - the highest since Jan. 9. Soybeans rose 1.1 percent on Friday. \n* The most active corn futures rose 0.6 percent to $3.48-1/4 a bushel, having closed down 0.7 percent in the previous session. \n* The USDA raised its estimate for U.S. corn production due to record-large yields and trimmed its estimate for the U.S. soybean harvest, even as that crop remained the biggest ever. \nMARKET NEWS \n* The euro briefly extended gains and German benchmark bond yields hit the day's high after European Central Bank rate-setter Ardo Hansson said the central bank could end its bond purchase scheme in one go after September if the economy and inflation develop as expected. \n* Oil hovered near a three-year high above $70 a barrel on Monday on signs that production cuts by OPEC and Russia are tightening supplies, although analysts warned of a \"red flag\" due to surging U.S. production. \n* Wall Street continued its rally on Friday with record closing highs as the fourth-quarter earnings season kicked off with solid results from banks and robust retail sales drove investor optimism about economic growth. \n* Chinese imports of soybeans jumped to the third-highest volume on record in December, according to customs data, boosted by strong demand in the run-up to next month's Lunar New Year holiday and healthy crushing margins. \nDATA AHEAD (GMT) \n0700 Germany Wholesale price index Dec 0930 UK Consumer prices Dec 1330 US New York Fed manufacturing Jan \nGrains prices at 0136 GMT \nContract Last Change Pct chg Two-day chg MA 30 RSI CBOT wheat 420.00 -0.50 -0.12% -1.47% 411.92 36 CBOT corn 348.25 2.00 +0.58% -2.79% 355.28 45 CBOT soy 964.75 4.25 +0.44% -7.26% 1023.69 59 CBOT rice 11.97 $0.16 +1.35% +19.94% $9.86 65 WTI crude 64.51 $0.21 +0.33% +21.69% $52.76 86 \nCurrencies \nEuro/dlr $1.226 $0.166 +15.62% +15.18% USD/AUD 0.7954 0.048 +6.41% +6.07% \nMost active contracts Wheat, corn and soy US cents/bushel.
