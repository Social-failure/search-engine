They said this was essential to sexual freedom and that women could be strong enough “not to be traumatised by gropers in the metro.”\n“I think it’s a bit out of sync with what many women may experience,” Transport Minister Elisabeth Borne told France 2 television, saying sexual harassment on public transport was a serious issue the government tried to tackle.\nGender Equality Minister Marlene Schiappa last year told Reuters she believed the Weinstein scandal would force a rethink of attitudes towards sexual harassment in France.\nDeneuve received international acclaim for her acting which included starring roles in films by renowned directors including François Truffaut, Roman Polanski and Luis Bunuel.\nDeneuve also occasionally worked as a model, including as the face of Chanel No 5 and representing Marianne, the national symbol of France for some years during the 1980s.\nDe Haas and the other activists argued that those of a mind with Deneuve ignore the reality of sexual harassment.\n“As soon as there is some progress with (gender) equality, even by half a millimetre, some good souls warn that we may be going too far,” they wrote.
