The regulator has also reviewed ANZ’s proposal to remediate about 320 customers who took out car loans, which is expected to total about A$5 million.\nIn a statement of agreed facts, ANZ acknowledged it did not take “reasonable steps” to verify customers’ financial situation in relation to 12 loan contracts submitted by three broker businesses to ANZ. The bank said it has disaccredited the individuals responsible for submitting the contracts.\n“We take our responsible lending obligations seriously and we have since taken steps to strengthen our ability to prevent and detect fraud by third parties,” said Fred Ohlsson, the bank’s Group Executive Australia.\nMajor Australian banks have recently come under close scrutiny from the government, which announced an inquiry into a scandal-hit finance sector last year.\nShares of the bank were up 0.85 percent at 0347 GMT, compared with a 0.1 percent rise in the benchmark index.\n$1 = 1.2579 Australian dollars Reporting by Shashwat Pradhan in Bengaluru; Editing by Richard Pullin\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-01-18T12:23:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-18T16:01:51.009+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
