In 2016, Republican U.S. lawmakers expressed concern that Facebook was suppressing news stories of interest to conservative readers.\nLast week, Zuckerberg said the company would change the way it filters posts and videos on News Feed to prioritise what friends and family share.\nReporting by David Ingram; Editing by Andrew Hay and Leslie Adler\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-19T23:03:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-19T23:36:21.024+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
