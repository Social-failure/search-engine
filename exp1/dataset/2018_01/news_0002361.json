The survey’s authors said a number of respondents signalled that they were receiving higher new orders from customers in North America. \n“Given the strong conditions evident in the manufacturing sector, it is no surprise to see that firms are upbeat about the outlook, with more than six times as many companies expecting to see growth in 2018 as opposed to those who anticipate a decline,” said Investec Ireland chief economist Philip O‘Sullivan. \n“With global growth expected to improve to a seven-year high in 2018, we think that firms are right to be confident about their prospects for this year.” Reporting by Padraic Halpin; Editing by Hugh Lawson", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-02T08:06:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-02T08:36:35.004+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
