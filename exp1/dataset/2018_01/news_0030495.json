Most of their terms were set to end in May, which would have allowed Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke to choose replacements then. \nKnowles had said the concerns of the resigning panel members included climate change and a difference in policies regarding the hiring of diverse candidates by the U.S. National Park Service. \nThe National Park System Advisory Board was created by the U.S. Congress in 1935 and is tasked with advising on matters such as the designation of historic and natural landmarks.
