The plan aimed to gain the confidence of investors that the airline could expand its profit margin and increase revenue, but instead stoked fears of low fares and higher costs. \nUnited shares fell more than 11 percent on Wednesday, while American lost 6 percent and Southwest and Delta each shed around 5 percent.\nIn late 2016, Berkshire revealed a surprise bet on the sector, which Buffett had previously shunned. Years of post-bankruptcy consolidation among carriers and a decline in fuel prices has helped airlines rake in record profits in recent years.\nThe Berkshire CEO told CNBC in February that airlines \"had a bad first century.\" They're kind of like the Chicago Cubs,\" he said. \"And they got that century out of the way, I hope.\"\nNow airlines are facing more competition from low-cost rivals as well as rising fuel prices, but strong economic growth and strong business travel demand is expected to be a tailwind for the sector.\nInvestors will next focus on American Airlines and several of its competitors, including JetBlue and Southwest, which are scheduled to report their quarterly profits on Thursday morning.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-25T02:43:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-25T02:56:23.003+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
