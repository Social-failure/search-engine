The banks confirmed in statements that they had been attacked. The tax office could not imediately be reached for comment.\nIn Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS), attackers use computer networks they control to send such a large number of requests for information from websites that servers that host them can no longer handle the traffic and the sites become unreachable.\nReporting by Anthony Deutsch; Editing by Catherine Evans\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-01-29T21:13:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-30T19:11:07.008+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
