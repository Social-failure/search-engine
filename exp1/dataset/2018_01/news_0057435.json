He said the agent had been cooperating but had not yet been identified.\nThree people -- Nicholas Cunningham, 42, Jimmy Sanchez, 38 and Sophia Heath, 35 -- were charged Friday with aggravated kidnapping in connection with the case. The charge can bring up to 99 years in prison.\nAccording to arrest affidavits, Cunningham and Sanchez went to Valladares’ home, used duct tape to bind his hands and the hands of his son, then ransacked the place, took Valladares and left the son behind.\nThe child freed himself and went to his uncle’s nearby home. The uncle, Ernesto Valladares, was contacted by a person who said his brother had been kidnapped by a Mexican drug cartel. The uncle notified police who, with the FBI, tracked Valladares to the Houston residence where the raid took place.\nReporting by Peter Szekely in New York; Editing by Bernadette Baum\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-31T18:10:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-31T18:29:34.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
