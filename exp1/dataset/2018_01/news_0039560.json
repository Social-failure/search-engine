The company said in a statement that she would also resign from the board and did not name a replacement for her. \nPaul Creffield, previously managing director of the company’s commercial development division, has been appointed as group operations director with immediate effect, Countrywide said. \nCreffield’s responsibilities would now also include the sales and lettings division, the company said. \nThe company also named Long, currently a non-executive chairman on the board, to become the executive chairman on Wednesday. \n“Within our core Sales and Lettings area ... a key priority will be to implement changes that will enable this area to start delivering once again,” Long said in a statement. \nThe company warned in November the market for housing transactions was challenging. At the time, Countrywide forecast results for the year ended December 31, 2017 at the lower end of market expectations. \nThis has forced property dealers, including Countrywide, to invest in digital expansion, close branches and slash headcount to stave off the growing threat from online agencies like Purplebricks that lure customers by charging lower fees. \nCountrywide’s shares rose 2 percent to 102 pence at 1039 GMT.
