Kentucky State Police late Tuesday identified the slain girl as Bailey Holt and the boy as Preston Cope. Both were 15.\n- Holt was pronounced dead at the scene, state police said in a statement. Photos on her Facebook page showed her displaying her support for University of Louisville Cardinals football by wearing team jerseys and T-shirts.\n- Cope died at Vanderbilt Medical Center, according to state police. The youth suffered an “unsurvivable brain injury,” Dr. Oscar Guillamondegui, medical director of hospital’s trauma unit, told a news conference on Tuesday.\nA Facebook user named Tim Weatherbee who identified himself as a friend shared old photos of the boy posing with a trophy for the Calvert City Sluggers Little League team in Calvert City, about 13 miles north of Benton.\n“These boys spent many years together learning the game of baseball and building a friendship, a brotherhood,” Weatherbee wrote online. “Preston Cope was a part of that brotherhood. R.I.P. Preston #sluggersforever.”\nReporting by Gina Cherelus in New York; Editing by Jonathan Oatis\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-01-25T04:13:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-25T13:16:09.008+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
