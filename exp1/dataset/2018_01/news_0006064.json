( bit.ly/2E6gAGX ) \nThe former Interscope CEO joined Apple in 2014 after the iPhone maker bought Beats Electronics, the audio technology firm co-founded by influential hip-hop producer Dr Dre and Iovine, for $3 billion. \nApple declined to comment. \nThe company told Billboard in September it had 30 million Apple Music subscribers.
