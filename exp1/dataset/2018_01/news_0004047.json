This means around 16M iPhone sales could be at risk, creating ~4% downside to our current revenue estimate for C2018.\"\nBarclays says it remains neutral on Apple stock. It believes Wall Street is \"too optimistic about the iPhone X super cycle\" but thinks Apple's growth in services and the new tax law are good for the company's business.\nApple said last week that it would begin to replace aging batteries in late January, but subsequently said that it's able to do so immediately.\nThe company made the decision following backlash after it was revealed that it was purposefully slowing down the processing speed on some iPhones — which meant older iPhones would run apps and software slower — in an effort to maximize battery performance.\nNow, with replacement batteries, users will be able to use the phone at its maximum performance levels.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-03T17:43:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-03T17:42:43.025+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
