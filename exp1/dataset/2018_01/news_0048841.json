We owe it to our citizens, who are operating in a state of uncertainty, to move much faster.” \nBut Lighthizer’s Mexican and Canadian counterparts said that enough progress was made in Montreal to be optimistic about concluding the pact “soon,” with nine days of talks in Mexico City scheduled to start Feb. 26. \n“For the next round, we will still have substantial challenges to overcome. Yet the progress made so far puts us on the right track to create landing zones to conclude the negotiation soon,” said Mexico’s Economy Minister Ildefonso Guajardo. \nOfficials are now openly speculating that the bid to salvage the $1.2-trillion free trade pact will continue well beyond an end-March deadline set to avoid Mexican presidential elections. CANADIAN PROPOSALS DISMISSED \nHeading into Montreal last week, some officials had feared the United States might be prepared to pull the plug on the pact amid frustration over slow progress. \nThe mood lightened after Canada presented a series of suggested compromises to address U.S. demands for reform.

Negotiators are supposed to finish in Washington in March with the eighth and final round. \nAlthough some officials have privately speculated about freezing the talks at the start of April, Guajardo told reporters that “we cannot afford to suspend this process.” Writing by David Ljunggren; Additional reporting by Allison Lampert and David Ljunggren in Montreal; Editing by Bernadette Baum and Nick Zieminski", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-29T22:13:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-29T22:42:22.017+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
