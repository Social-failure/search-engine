REUTERS/Steve Marcus \nBy far the sport’s most high-profile athlete, McGregor rose through the UFC ranks, knocking out Jose Aldo in 13 seconds to be crowned featherweight champion in December 2015 and adding the lightweight belt less than a year later. \nBut the 29-year-old’s time as a two-weight champion was short-lived as he was soon stripped of the featherweight belt. McGregor has not mounted a title defence in either weight class. \nHis only outing since beating Eddie Alvarez for the lightweight belt in November 2016 was a lucrative boxing match in August last year against the undefeated Floyd Mayweather, which the Irishman lost in the 10th round.
