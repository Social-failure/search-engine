But when markets are starting to price in the ECB’s exit, investors will also think the BOJ will be the only one that has yet to do so,” Yusuke Ikawa, strategist at BNP Paribas\nDutch central bank chief Klaas Knot said on Sunday he ECB should make clear that it will end its asset purchases after the current bond buying programme ends in September, helping lift the 10-year German bund yield to a one-year high of 0.644 percent.\nThe latest rise in the 10-year yield puts the BOJ in a difficult position. Whenever the yield rose or threatened to rise above 0.1 percent in the past, the central bank has offered unlimited buying at the yield of 0.11 percent.\nSome market players think the BOJ could take such an action soon if the yield rises further.\nBut analysts also say bringing down the yield ahead of Thursday’s 10-year JGB auction will not be welcomed by investors.\nThe 10-year yield last stood at 0.090 percent , after having risen to 0.095 percent, its highest since July 11.\nThe 20-year bond yield rose 2.0 basis points to 0.595 percent while the 30-year yield rose 1.5 basis points to 0.820 percent.\nThe 10-year JGB futures price dropped 0.14 point to 150.17.\nThe short end of the market was firmer after solid results of two-year JGB auction on Tuesday. It attracted bids 5.02 times the offer, up from bit-to-cover of 4.32 the previous month.\nThe two-year yield was flat at minus 0.130 percent .
