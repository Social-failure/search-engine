Laine one-timed a perfect cross-ice pass from Blake Wheeler for his 23rd goal of season.\nConnor netted the game winner just after another power play expired when he buried his second rebound opportunity against Lightning goalie Louis Domingue for his 16th goal of the campaign.\nBryan Little provided the insurance tally late in regulation.\nTampa’s Matthew Peca collected his first goal of the season late in the opening frame, but the Lightning’s three-game winning streak was snapped.\nDomingue stopped 34 shots for Tampa, which had won its last four times in Winnipeg.\nOn the positive for the Lightning, star defenseman Victor Hedman returned after missing only five games, an incredibly quick recovery from what was supposed to be a three-to-six-week absence because of a lower-body injury.\nThe Jets, who have been without top center Mark Scheifele due to a suspected shoulder injury, now also have defenseman Jacob Trouba on the shelf for a couple of months due to an ankle injury. The good news for them is forward Adam Lowry returned after missing eight games due to injury.\n--Field Level Media\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-01-31T12:11:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-31T16:51:30.009+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
