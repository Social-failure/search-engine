Some numbers in this press release may not add due to rounding. Reported results were prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) and include all revenue and expenses recognized during the periods. Non-GAAP measures exclude the items described in the reconciliation tables later in the release. The company's 2018 financial guidance is also being provided on both a reported and a non-GAAP basis. The non-GAAP measures are presented to provide additional insights into the underlying trends in the company's business.\n\"Lilly's new products, including Trulicity, Taltz and Jardiance, continued to drive solid revenue growth in the fourth quarter of 2017, while we maintained flat operating expenses,\" said David A. Ricks, Lilly's chairman and CEO. \"Momentum continues for our innovation-based strategy. We recently received approval for Taltz in the U.S. and European Union for active psoriatic arthritis, are encouraged by early use of Verzenio for breast cancer and expect further pipeline progress in 2018 in areas of significant patient need, including cancer, immunologic disorders, diabetes, neurodegeneration and pain.\"\nKey Events Over the Last Three Months\nRegulatory\nRegarding Taltz ® (ixekizumab), for the treatment of adults with active psoriatic arthritis: The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) issued its approval and the company launched in the U.S. The European Commission issued its approval.\nClinical\nThe company announced top-line results from its Phase 3 study of Cyramza ® (ramucirumab) in combination with cisplatin and capecitabine or 5-FU (5-fluorouracil) in the first-line treatment of patients with HER2-negative metastatic gastric or gastroesophageal junction adenocarcinoma. The trial met its primary endpoint of progression-free survival but did not improve overall survival, a secondary endpoint. The company does not intend to seek regulatory approval based on the results of this study. The company initiated a clinical trial to evaluate the functionality and safety of its automated insulin delivery system in Type 1 diabetes, which is a hybrid closed-loop platform that uses connected devices -- an insulin pump with a dedicated controller, dosing algorithm and continuous glucose monitor -- to automate insulin dosing. This system is part of the Connected Diabetes Ecosystem, which is being designed to make diabetes management easier by enabling people to use insulin more effectively.\nFourth-Quarter Reported Results\nIn the fourth quarter of 2017, worldwide revenue was $6.161 billion, an increase of 7 percent compared with the fourth quarter of 2016. The revenue increase was driven by a 4 percent increase due to volume, a 2 percent increase due to higher realized prices, and a 1 percent increase due to the favorable impact of foreign exchange rates.\nRevenue in the U.S. increased 6 percent, to $3.423 billion, due to increased volume for new pharmaceutical products, including Trulicity ® , Basaglar ® , Taltz, Jardiance ® , Lartruvo™ and Verzenio™, as well as higher realized prices for several pharmaceutical products, primarily Forteo ® and Humulin ® . The increase in revenue was partially offset by decreased volume due to loss of exclusivity for Strattera ® and Effient ® , as well as decreased demand for Cialis ® and food animal products, and lower realized prices for Humalog ® . Realized prices reflect increased revenue related to changes in estimates for rebates and discounts of a similar magnitude in the fourth quarter of both 2017 and 2016.\nRevenue outside the U.S. increased 8 percent, to $2.738 billion, largely due to increased volume for several new pharmaceutical products, including Trulicity, Taltz, Cyramza, Jardiance and Olumiant ® and, to a lesser extent, the favorable impact of foreign exchange rates.\nGross margin increased 6 percent, to $4.536 billion, in the fourth quarter of 2017 compared with the fourth quarter of 2016. Gross margin as a percent of revenue was 73.6 percent, a decrease of 1.0 percentage point compared with the fourth quarter of 2016. The decrease in gross margin percent was primarily due to the effect of foreign exchange rates on international inventories sold and product mix, partially offset by manufacturing efficiencies and higher realized prices.\nOperating expenses in the fourth quarter of 2017, defined as the sum of research and development and marketing, selling and administrative expenses, remained flat at $3.254 billion. Research and development expenses increased 2 percent, to $1.473 billion, or 23.9 percent of revenue. Marketing, selling and administrative expenses decreased 1 percent, to $1.780 billion, due to decreased expenses related to late life-cycle products, partially offset by increased expenses related to new pharmaceutical products. Operating expenses were 52.8 percent of revenue in the fourth quarter of 2017, a reduction of 3.4 percentage points compared with the fourth quarter of 2016.\nIn the fourth quarter of 2017, the company recognized an acquired in-process research and development charge of $50.0 million associated with a strategic collaboration with CureVac. In the fourth quarter of 2016, the company recognized an acquired in-process research and development charge of $30.0 million associated with an agreement with AstraZeneca to co-develop MEDI1814, a potential disease-modifying treatment for Alzheimer's disease.\nIn the fourth quarter of 2017, the company recognized asset impairment, restructuring and other special charges of $1.003 billion. The charges are primarily associated with efforts to reduce the company's cost structure, including the U.S. voluntary early retirement program. In the fourth quarter of 2016, the company recognized asset impairment, restructuring and other special charges of $147.6 million, primarily associated with global severance costs and integration costs related to the acquisition of Novartis Animal Health.\nOperating income in the fourth quarter of 2017 was $229.0 million, a decrease of $647.2 million compared with the fourth quarter of 2016, primarily driven by higher asset impairment, restructuring and other special charges, partially offset by higher gross margin.\nOther income (expense) was income of $55.1 million in the fourth quarter of 2017, compared with income of $15.8 million in the fourth quarter of 2016. The increase in other income was driven primarily by higher net gains on sales of investments in the fourth quarter of 2017 as compared with 2016.\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2017, the company recorded income tax expense of $1.941 billion, which included an estimated tax charge of $1.914 billion, despite earning $284.1 million of income before income taxes. The estimated tax charge is based on recently enacted U.S. tax reform legislation, including a one-time repatriation transition tax, also known as the \"toll tax,\" of approximately $3.6 billion. The estimated tax charge is subject to change based upon additional analysis and subsequent regulations, interpretations and guidance. As a result of new rules related to repatriation, Lilly may utilize more than $9 billion in cash held across the company's global affiliates.\nIn the fourth quarter of 2017, net income (loss) and earnings (loss) per share were $(1.657) billion and $(1.58), respectively, compared with $771.8 million and $0.73, respectively, in the fourth quarter of 2016. The decreases in net income (loss) and earnings (loss) per share were primarily driven by the impact of recently enacted U.S. tax reform legislation, as well as higher asset impairment, restructuring and other special charges.\nFourth-Quarter Non-GAAP Measures\nOn a non-GAAP basis, fourth-quarter 2017 gross margin increased 6 percent, to $4.710 billion. Gross margin as a percent of revenue was 76.5 percent, a decrease of 0.9 percentage points compared with the fourth quarter of 2016. The decrease in gross margin percent was primarily due to the effect of foreign exchange rates on international inventories sold and product mix, partially offset by manufacturing efficiencies and higher realized prices.\nOperating expenses were 52.8 percent of revenue in the fourth quarter of 2017, a reduction of 3.4 percentage points compared with the fourth quarter of 2016.\nOperating income increased $239.4 million, or 20 percent, to $1.458 billion in the fourth quarter of 2017, due to higher gross margin.\nThe effective tax rate was 20.2 percent in the fourth quarter of 2017, compared with 17.9 percent in the fourth quarter of 2016. The higher effective tax rate for the fourth quarter of 2017 was primarily due to a lower net discrete tax benefit compared with the fourth quarter of 2016.\nIn the fourth quarter of 2017, net income increased 19 percent, to $1.207 billion, and earnings per share increased 20 percent, to $1.14, compared with $1.013 billion and $0.95, respectively, in the fourth quarter of 2016. The increases in net income and earnings per share were primarily driven by higher operating income.\nFor further detail of non-GAAP measures, see the reconciliation below as well as the Reconciliation of GAAP Reported to Selected Non-GAAP Adjusted Information table later in this press release.\nFourth Quarter\n2017\n2016\n% Change\nEarnings (loss) per share (reported)\n$\n(1.58)\n$\n0.73\nNM\nU.S. tax reform legislation\n1.81\n—\nAsset impairment, restructuring and other special charges\n.75\n.10\nAmortization of intangible assets\n.11\n.11\nAcquired in-process research and development\n.03\n.02\nInventory step-up costs associated with the acquisition of Boehringer Ingelheim Vetmedica's U.S. feline, canine and rabies vaccine portfolio\n.01\n—\nEarnings per share (non-GAAP)\n$\n1.14\n$\n0.95\n20%\nNumbers may not add due to rounding.\nFull-Year Reported Results\nFor the full year 2017, worldwide revenue increased 8 percent compared with 2016 to $22.871 billion. The revenue increase was driven by a 6 percent increase due to volume and a 2 percent increase due to higher realized prices.\nRevenue in the U.S. increased 11 percent to $12.785 billion, driven by increased volume for new pharmaceutical products, including Trulicity, Taltz, Basaglar, Lartruvo and Jardiance, and higher realized prices for several pharmaceutical products, primarily Forteo and Cialis, as well as increased volume for companion animal products from the acquisition of Boehringer Ingelheim Vetmedica's U.S. feline, canine and rabies vaccine portfolio. The increase in revenue was partially offset by decreased volume due to loss of exclusivity for Strattera and Effient, as well as decreased demand for Cialis and food animal products. Cymbalta revenue declined $154 million, primarily driven by an increase in revenue due to a reduction to the return reserve in 2016.\nRevenue outside the U.S. increased 4 percent to $10.086 billion, due to increased volume for several new pharmaceutical products, primarily driven by Trulicity and Cyramza. The increase in revenue was partially offset by competitive pressure and the loss of exclusivity for Alimta in several countries and lower volume from the loss of exclusivity for Zyprexa in Japan.\nGross margin increased 8 percent to $16.801 billion in 2017. Gross margin as a percent of revenue was 73.5 percent, an increase of 0.1 percentage points compared with 2016.

The charges are primarily associated with efforts to reduce the company's cost structure, including the U.S. voluntary early retirement program. In 2016, the company recognized asset impairment, restructuring, and other special charges of $382.5 million associated with integration and severance costs related to the acquisition of Novartis Animal Health, other global severance costs, and asset impairments related to the closure of an animal health manufacturing facility in Ireland.\nOperating income in 2017 decreased 38 percent compared with 2016 to $2.145 billion, as higher operating expenses driven by asset impairment, restructuring, and other special charges, as well as acquired in-process research and development, were partially offset by higher gross margin.\nOther income (expense) was income of $52.4 million in 2017. Other income (expense) in 2016 was expense of $84.8 million driven by a $203.9 million charge related to the impact of the Venezuelan financial crisis, including the significant deterioration of the bolívar, partially offset by higher net gains on investments.\nDuring 2017, the company recorded income tax expense of $2.402 billion, which included an estimated tax charge of $1.914 billion, despite earning $2.197 billion of income before income taxes. The estimated tax charge is based on recently enacted U.S. tax reform legislation, including the toll tax of approximately $3.6 billion.
