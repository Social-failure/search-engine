The transaction is expected to reach $2.7 billion with the sale of additional allotments of shares, making it Brazil’s biggest IPO since April 2013. \nPagSeguro’s shares rallied to $28.87 in early afternoon trading in New York, up from the IPO price of $21.50 price on Tuesday. Investors are optimistic about the growth prospects for Brazil’s credit card industry as Latin America’s largest economy pulls out of a deep recession. \nThe buoyant valuation is a good sign for other credit card processing firms that are expected to list their shares in the following months, including Stone Pagamentos SA. Reuters reported on Monday that the company also plans an IPO in New York. \nFounded in 2006, PagSeguro is owned by Universo Online SA (UOL), a firm controlled by Luis Frias, scion of the family controlling newspaper Folha de S. Paulo. UOL will receive $1.2 billion from the sale of part of its stake, already including the sale of additional share allotment. \nPagSeguro itself raised $1.1 billion to fund acquisitions and finance working capital with the sale of additional shares. \nThe transaction is expected to reach $2.7 billion with the sale of the supplementary allotment of shares over the next 30 days, according to a source with knowledge of the matter. $1 = 3.17 reais Additional reporting by Tatiana Bautzer; Editing by Cynthia Osterman", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-24T22:42:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-24T22:56:50.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
