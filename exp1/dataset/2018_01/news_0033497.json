Some members of the previous committee are the target of a judicial probe over the illegal independence referendum organised in October.\nRajoy’s deputy Soraya Saenz de Santamaria on Thursday urged parliament to respect the law, telling Cadena Cope radio: “He (Puigdemont) knows it, he can’t rule from the Bahamas.”\nThe previous Puigdemont-led administration made a unilateral declaration of independence in October after the referendum, triggering one of Spain’s biggest political crises since its return to democracy four decades ago. The government in Madrid imposed direct rule on the region.\nRajoy called regional elections on Dec. 21 in a bid to weaken the independence movement, but the vote returned an assembly with a separatist majority.\nReporting by Inmaculada Sanz; Writing by Ingrid Melander; Editing by Angus Berwick and Hugh Lawson\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-18T18:11:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-18T18:27:48.014+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
