Reuters did not verify the report.\nPeter Zulu, a local resident, said rioters had blocked Los Angeles Road, a major thoroughfare, and that police had fired tear gas to try to disperse them.\nReporting by Chris Mfula; Editing by Peter Graff\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-12T09:35:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-12T09:54:54.004+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
