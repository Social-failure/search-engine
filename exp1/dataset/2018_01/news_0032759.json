They will be without backrow forwards Sean O‘Brien, Rhys Ruddock, Tommy O‘Donnell and Jamie Heaslip, and centres Garry Ringrose and Jared Payne, who are all absent through injury. \nIreland, however, have been stockpiling depth in those two positions in particular with the opening fixtures potentially giving centres Bundee Aki and Chris Farrell and flankers Dan Leavy and Josh van der Flier the chance to impress. \n“It’s been great to witness some quality performances from provincial teams over the last seven weeks of European and derby matches, with a number of players performing well,” Schmidt said in a statement on Tuesday. \n“There were some very tight decisions but it’s great to see some competitive depth in a number of positions.” \nIreland squad \nForwards: Rory Best (captain), Jack Conan, Sean Cronin, Ultan Dillane, Tadhg Furlong, Cian Healy, Iain Henderson, Rob Herring, Dave Kilcoyne, Dan Leavy, Jack McGrath, Jordi Murphy, Peter O‘Mahony, Andrew Porter, Quinn Roux, James Ryan, John Ryan, CJ Stander, Devin Toner, Josh van der Flier. \nBacks: Bundee Aki, Joey Carbery, Andrew Conway, Keith Earls, Chris Farrell, Robbie Henshaw, Rob Kearney, Ian Keatley, Jordan Larmour, Kieran Marmion, Fergus McFadden, Luke McGrath, Conor Murray, Johnny Sexton, Rory Scannell, Jacob Stockdale.
