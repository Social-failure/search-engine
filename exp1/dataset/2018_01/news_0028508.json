The packets are free of charge and available at 4,700 Walmart and Sam’s Club stores with pharmacies. \nCiting data from the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration and the National Institute of Drug Abuse, Walmart said some 65% of opioid abusers get them from unwitting family and friends. And about one third of medications sold go unused, making them more readily available for abuse. \nAs Fortune reported in an in-depth report on the crisis in September, an American is now far likelier to die of a drug overdose than in a car crash. In 2015, opioid overdoses claimed 91 lives a day in the U.S. \nWhile drug distributors like McKesson have borne the brunt of criticism, pharmacy operators have faced pressure as well to step up their role in fighting the crisis. A few months ago, CVS Health , (cvs) the largest dispenser of drug prescriptions in the country ($61 billion worth in 2016) said it would limit the prescription of opioids for some conditions to seven days, a move Walmart has also advocated. \nWalmart has a 5% share of the U.S. prescription market, according to Pembroke Consulting, having filled $20.6 billion worth of scripts in 2016, putting it on par with No. 3 U.S. drugstore chain Rite Aid . \nDisposeRx packets have a polymer blend that when combined with warm water in the pill bottle sequesters any type of prescription drug, whether a powder, pills, tablets, capsules, liquids or patches, into a biodegradable gel. \nStarting Wednesday, patients getting a new Class II opioid prescription filled at a Walmart pharmacy will get a free DisposeRx packet. Those with chronic Class II opioid prescriptions will be able to get one every six months.
